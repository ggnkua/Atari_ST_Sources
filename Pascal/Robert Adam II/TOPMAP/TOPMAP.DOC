 PURPOSE:
	This program can be used to create a contoured surface 
    with features resembling natural geological formations
    (lakes, mountains, ...).  You may also display the results
    in a limited number of ways.  
         NOTE:  The display will only work correctly in low resolution
               though you may generate a map in any resolution.

       
 LANGUAGE:
	This program was written entirely in Personal Pascal from OSS.

        
 USE:
	This is a GEM based program.

	FILE	load - load in a saved map file
		new  - create a new map using the height and width from
                      from OPTIONS menu
 		old  - load a map saved by version 0.1
		save - save the current map to a file and, in the process,
		      name it
		
	VIEW	isometric   - a modified isometric view
                overhead    - a view from directly above which is the
                             one you normally get when you create a new
			     map
                perspective - a perspective view

	OPTIONS shadow - when drawing a map, produce shadows as though
			the sun was to the left of the picture.  You will
                        be given a choice of three angles (Low, Medium,
                        High)
		watch  - allows you to watch while a new map is being
			produced.  ( You may want to hide the map from 
                        yourself if you will be using it in a game that
                        you will be playing. )
		water  - if "water" is on you can not see below the surface
			otherwise you see the underwater land contours
		height - how many "tiles" high a new map will be
		width  - how many "tiles" wide a new map will be
		reset  - reset the colors to the TOPMAP setup (in case a
			desk accessory changes back to the default colors)


 MISCELLANEOUS:
	You may cancel the display of a map by pressing the left mouse
      button and holding it until the alert box appears then clicking on
      the YES option.  You may not resume a canceled display, though you
      may restart it.
	
	You cannot cancel the creation of a map started by NEW.  You must
      either wait until it finishes or reboot.

	The SAVE and LOAD really do take a long time (~1 min. 30 sec. for
      SAVE about half that for LOAD), it's not just your imagination.

	To map the colors to altitude, I divided the altitude range into
      9 evenly sized pieces.  I assigned three of these pieces to the water
      (blue) region, while each of the other colors got one piece.



 DATA FILE FORMAT:
      The file is a Pascal file of integer (where an integer is a 16 bit word).

	word offset	value stored
       ----------------------------------------------------------	
	0		number of tiles in width
	1		number of tiles in height
	2-17		colors from xbios(7) call stored 0 to 15
	...		the data for the map stored in row order

	A "tile" is a square that is 65 pixels on a side.  The adjacent
      tiles overlap by a column (or row), so in a 3 by 2 (width by height)
      tile map, the pixel size is 193 by 129 instead of the expected
      195 by 130.
        The map data should be in the range of 0 to 25000 but it sometimes
      strays out of bounds.
	The map is stored a row at a time so the first 193 words of data for
      a 3 tile wide map will be the first horizontal line of the map.
