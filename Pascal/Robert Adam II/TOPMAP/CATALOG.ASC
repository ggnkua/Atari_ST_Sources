TOPMAP by Robert Adam II is "Fractal Topographical Maps"  This program can
be used to create a contoured surface with features resembling natural
geological formations (lakes, mountains, ...).  You may also display the
results in a limited number of ways.  NOTE:  The display will only work
correctly in low resolution though you may generate a map in any
resolution.  Written in Personal Pascal from OSS and entirely GEM based.
