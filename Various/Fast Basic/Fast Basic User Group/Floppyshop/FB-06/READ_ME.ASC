
THE FAST BASIC USERS GROUP
--------------------------

Since the Summer of August 1987 a group 
was set up to provide assistance to Fast 
Basic owners after Computer Concepts
moved to another market.

Unfortunately this group ended its career 
at the end of 1989 after running 
successfully for 2 years with a peak 
membership of over 750.

During this time 10 newsletters where 
produced and sent to its members. These 
newsletters mostly contained tutorails 
for complete beginners and we had 
coverage in following areas in at least
1 issue:-

  *  BASIC
  *  Assembler (68000)
     GEM
     Music & Midi
     Graphics

* donates a sizeable entry in every issue

We also provided some Hints and Tips.


In the authors opinion Fast Basic still 
remains the most friendly to learn on. 
It was based on BBC Basic well known and 
widely used throughout the British 
Education system.

The manual supplied only gives details on 
the commands in-bedded in the language. 
Through our tutorials nearly every 
command has been explained with examples 
and practical advise.

All the Fast Basic Programs which the 
group collected have been passed on to a 
selection of libraries. The purpose of 
this file is to tell you about the 
existance of some information on actually
using your Fast Basic.
