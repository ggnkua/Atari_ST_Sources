                            FAST BASIC PROGRAMMING
  ****************************************************************************
  The following disks originated from the Fast Basic User Group which   ceased
  operation at the end of 1989. The programs on these disks  cover a number of
  different areas and contain full source code which  can be adapted for  your
  own purposes.  For this reason these disks  have not been categorised. Users
  who do not own Fast Basic can still  use the programs as a runner program is
  provided on disk.

  The  same  spreadsheet  as on UTL.86 but in  .BSC  form.  Medium  res  only.

  programs  designed  to allow you to record and playback  through  the   Midi
  ports  and  control the Akai S700/X7000 hardware  sample  sequencer.    MIDI
  PROGRAMMING  in  Fast Basic by R C Alden - This program will  allow  you  to
  create  sounds  for your Casio synthesizer on the  screen using  the  mouse.
  These  sounds  can be stored on disk as single  sounds or as a bank  of  16.
  These sounds can easily down loaded to  the synthesizer,  again as a  single
  sound or as a bank of 16. Sounds  may also be loaded up from the synthesizer
  altered and stored etc. Requires Fast Basic on cartridge OR 1 Meg memory.
