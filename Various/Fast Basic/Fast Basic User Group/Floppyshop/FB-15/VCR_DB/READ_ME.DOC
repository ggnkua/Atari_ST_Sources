
\VCR_DB was written by necessity
\due to the non-availabilty of an
\inexpensive simple card-index type
\Database. In its present form it
\is a dedicated program which only
\works with 1 data file, but Fast
\Basic users should have little
\difficulty in customising it for
\a record collection or anything
\similar.

\The program is designed to be easy
\to follow, and to illustrate many
\of Fast Basic's keywords. I have
\tried to use meaningful names for
\variables and procedures, and to
\avoid GOTO and other bad habits.
\Note that if modifying program
\lines containing the keyword
\PUTREC# that it is necessary to
\use eg 'ON 27' for a 25 character
\text field, ie 2 more than the
\Fast Basic manual suggests.

\The program follows the example of
\the one I used on the BBC Micro,
\and stores all data on disk. All
\records edited or added are
\written to disk immediately. This
\has the benefit of data files only
\being limited in size by disk
\capacity. Also there is no chance
\of losing data if the computer
\crashes, as there would be if it
\were purely RAM based. It also
\hopefully serves as a useful
\introduction to Random Access
\filing.  When sorting alphabetic-
\ally, a tagfile is used for speed
\as physically rearranging records
\on a disk surface would take
\forever. 2 arrays are used for
\sorting, data$ and R%, and are
\dimensioned currently to 1800.
\Increase this if more than 1800
\records are required. If you are
\going to add records, remember
\that any previous tagfiles (data
\from previous sorting) will not
\take account of the new additions.
\For a new alphabetical sort, it is
\necessary to delete any tagfile on
\the disk. The program reminds you
\of this if a tagfile is found on
\the disk when selecting 'Sort'.

\The program configures Epson
\compatible printers for standard
\fanfold paper and condensed print.
\Make sure your printer is on line
\before trying to print. A sample
\data file is supplied.   

\A final technical note: I found it
\necessary to close the data file
\after accessing it in some cases
\as the computer loads 6 records at
\a time into its buffer. During
\listing, printing, finding etc the
\file is left open until the
\program is finished with it.
