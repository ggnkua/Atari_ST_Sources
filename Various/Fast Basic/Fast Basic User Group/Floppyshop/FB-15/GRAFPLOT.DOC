                             GRAFPLOT

             A graph plotting program by Frank Hollis
          Written using Fast Basic by Computer Concepts
                          September 1987


     Grafplot  is  a program for plotting the  graphs  of  various 
functions  over  any  range.   All  arithmetic  fuctions  normally 
available  from  Fast  Basic may be used in  the  function  to  be 
plotted  as  long  as there are  no  illegal  operations  involved 
(division by zero, log of a negative number etc). Please note that 
this program will work in HI-RES ONLY.

     After  the graph has been plotted the user has the option  to 
plot  another  function,  dump  the plot to  an  Epson  compatible 
printer or expand any portion of the graph to full screen.

                       ENTRY OF FUNCTIONS.
     When run, the program prompts for the function with 'y='.
The function should be entered using x as the unknown.

     i.e.           y=x^4+3*x^3-x^2+5.5*x-3

Note that x has to be entered in lower case. There is a routine to 
automatically  switch off the caps lock but it may  be  accidently 
re-set.  If the program refuses to accept all functions check  the 
state of the caps lock.

     The  next values required are the minimum and maximum  values 
of x.  The scale routine will very often extend this range to some 
extent.  This may cause occasional problems. (If y=sqr(x) over the 
range 0.1 to 20 is plotted the program will exit when it tries  to 
calculate  the square root of 0 as the scale will extend this  far 
downwards).

     The  arithmetic operators + ,- ,* ,/ ,^ ,square ,sqr  (square 
root),  log (base 10), ln (base e),alog (anti-log) and exp amy all 
be used. 

     If the trigonometric functions such as sin are to be used  it 
should be noted that they operate on values in radians. Values can 
be converted to degrees by use of the deg command.

     i.e.      y=sin(deg(x))  over the range x = 0 to 360
will plot the sin function over 0ø to 360ø.
 
                           THE PROGRAM

     When the program is run initially two very short machine code 
routines are called.  These are bios call 13 to set caps lock off 
and  xbios  call  33 to set the printer  parameters.  I  use  this 
routine in my auto folder to dispense with the hassle of having to 
use the install printer desk accessory.  Both these are thanks  to 
John Braga in his book The ST Explored.

     The actual calculation of the function is performed using the 
EVAL  command in Fast Basic.  This evaluates an input string as  a 
basic  statement  and  makes  all  sorts  of  otherwise  difficult 
interactive routines exterely easy.

     The  scale routine is a translation from part  of  subroutine 
FP01B from the Harwell Fortran Subroutine Library.  This is a sort 
of  public domain system for the big boys.  Indeed,  most  of  the 
routines in the library are developed and run on a Cray!!!!!!!!!!

     The  expand routine was added as a late developement  when  I 
realised how easy it would be from Fast Basic. When this option is 
called the mouse pointer re-appears and should be moved to the top 
left hand corner of the area to be expanded. The left mouse button 
is then held down and a rubber-band box stretched over the desired 
range.  The  program  only  takes  note of the  x  values  of  the 
expansion.

     This  program is released into the public domain and  may  be 
given away if the following conditions are met.

     Any distribution is non profit making.

     Myself,  Computer Concepts Fast Basic and the Harwell Fortran 
     Subroutine Library must all be acknowledged.

     Any distribution must include this documentation which may be 
     altered if these conditions are still present.

If  you  come across any problems with this program  or  make  any 
improvements please let me know.

Finally  my  thanks to Graham Allen who has taught me all  I  know 
about maths and Fortran programming.
