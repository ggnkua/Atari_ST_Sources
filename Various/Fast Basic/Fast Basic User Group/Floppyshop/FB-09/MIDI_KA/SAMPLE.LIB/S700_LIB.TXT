This program is public domain and may be freely copied and distributed. 
Provided that it is not sold for profit and this document  along  with   
the accompanying HELP.TXT document is included unchanged.

     The program should work as described for both the Akai S700 and 
X7000 ( keyboard version of the above). Make sure that you read the 
HELP.TXT document before starting to use it.


     Although it is written specifically for use with the Akai S700/X7000
sampler it should save and load samples from any other sampler which
uses the standard sample dump format. Most notably the S900 and Prophet
2000. The samples will however only be up to 33500 words in length as
it is set up to store S700 samples ( maximum length of 32752 sample 
points). This could easily be changed if needed but as this version of
the program is written for the S700 the facility should be used to 
transfer samples from other samplers to the S700 or vice versa.
 I have not tried this yet and would be pleased to hear from anyone who 
has the opportunity to try it out.

     If however you feel that the facility to transfer or save larger 
samples would be of some use to you then you can contact me at the
address at the top (please enclose a stamped addressed envelope )with
details of the samples  you wish to use ( type of sampler ,sample length
etc.). Provided it does use the standard sample dump format then I should 
be able to modify the program to suit your set up.
     Alternatively send a cheque or postal order for five pounds and I'll 
send you the Fast Basic source code in ascii or Fast Basic (.BSC) format 
and a runnable copy of the latest version.

     Please keep me informed of any changes that you would  like to see        
made to the program. It has virtually been in daily use  for  the  last       
few   months and is constantly being updated. The next  changes  likely    
to be made will be on-line  help,graphical display and editing  of loop   
points  etc.  Any help or suggestions for any of the above will be  most 
welcome.

     Hopefully with enough feedback this program can be expanded to rival 
some  of  the vastly overpriced  commercial  librarian/editors.  A  large 
library  of  public domain samples for use on a wide number  of  machines 
would  also be possible (lets face it if we all jealously guard our  best 
samples  how  can  we expect other people to donate  their's).  The 
alternative is to keep paying through the nose for dubious and expensive
commercial samples.

     I  originally wrote this program to store my samples on 3.5 "  disks 
and so that  instead of having to load in samples from eight 'quick disks'
I could leave it to load in a disk full of samples by itself.
     Quick  disks are not only expensive but only store two  samples  per 
disk making the setting up of a large library of samples both costly  and 
time consuming.  Although samples still take a while to load and save(due 
to the limitations of sending 67Kbytes of code over midi) it is now a far 
more  inviting  proposition to save a complete set of  samples  for  each 
song.  
     It  should be possible to store at least five samples on a  single 
sided  disk,in  the worst possible case (assuming  all  samples  are  of 
maximum length and no extended formatters are used).  I usually manage to 
get six or seven samples on a disk.    


      The program  could also  form the basis of a budget sampling system
used in conjunction with the Akai S612. This uses similar samples to the
S700 and X7000 but does not store any sample parameter  information (see
the HELP.TXT document).  If this program  was used then there would be no
need for the optional 2.8" disk drive and the inconveniences associated 
with yet another type of disk to use (at about 2.99 each as well as only
storing two samples per disk ). I would be glad to transfer  samples from 
users Akai quick disks to 3.5" Atari format  disks to help in the setting 
up of such a system.
( PLEASE  NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS PERSONALLY BUT IT SHOULD  ALMOST 
DEFINITELY WORK. YOU SHOULD TRY IT OUT BEFORE COMMITTING ANY HARD EARNED 
CASH ).
