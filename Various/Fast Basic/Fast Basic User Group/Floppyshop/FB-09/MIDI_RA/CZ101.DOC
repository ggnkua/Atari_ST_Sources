            Sound editor for the Casio CZ101 & CZ1000

              This programe will only run in MED RES

Will need FAST BASIC and will only run on a 520ST when FAST  BASIC 
                        is on a CARTRIDGE 

Also on 520 ST No ACCESSORIES can be loaded indeed it is best to 
boot up with the DESKTOP file suppled on the disk

Enter FAST BASIC in normal way. Then load CZ101.BSC and run
Sometimes  you may get a memory error just try and rerun a  couple 
of times if this fails then reboot.

This program will allow you to create sounds for your Casio 
synthesizer on the screen using the mouse. These sounds can be 
stored on disc as single sounds or as a bank of 16. You should be 
able to store around 500 individual sounds on one single sided 
disc and around 1080 on a double sided disc.These sounds can 
easily down loaded to the synthesizer, again as a single sound or
asabankof16.Soundsmayalsobeloadedupfromthesynthesizer

All of these must be present when you run the program. 

Also included are the following

               17_TO_32.BAN
               33_TO_48.BAN

These are all of the sounds in the sound book supplied with the 
CZ101 in banks of 16.

               INTERNAL.BAN

This is a copy of the original internal bank present on reset of 
synthesizer

This manual will assume that you know how to program the 
synthesizer.

    On starting up the main screen will be drawn from disc as will 
the menu and some starting data. When the disc has finished 
working you may start to use the program.

    Most of the screen is taken with 3 large white blocks these 
are used to create the envelopes the names of each is down the 
lefthand side. Beneath each name is a number this tells you how 
many steps you have. Some envelopes are so close that you can't 
see how many there are hence the need for these numbers. Across 
the top of each block there are three boxes. The leftmost marked 
ADD STEP inserts a step and of course SUBTRACT STEP removes a 
step. The third box will switch on the SUS step after pointing to 
this box with the mouse it will turn RED and you then select which 
step you wish to SUSTAIN by pointing at it. The number of the step 
you have chosen will then be displayed in the box and your SUS 
step line will turn green. To remove SUS point to box again. (NOTE 
you can't make the last step SUS).

    In order to move the envelope just point to the junction you 
wish to change press the left mouse button and move to the desired 
position to help set a certain value use the display at the bottom 
right which will display the current value as you move the mouse. 
You will know if the mouse has locked onto a junction because the 
arrow will change to a pointing finger. IMPORTANT NOTE THE 
ENVELOPES ARE ONLY IN INCREMENTS OF TWO TO ALLOW THE ENVELOPES TO 
BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN. This will make no noticeable 
difference to the finished sound if copying a sound just round up 
or down.     To make things a little easier if editing and you 
just need to change the rate value hold down the LEFT SHIFT while 
selecting the junction you wish to alter, press ALTERNATE if you 
just wish to change the level    
    To select a WAVEFORM just point to box you want the top row is 
always switched on the bottom row can be on or off. To turn bottom 
row off point to wavefrom which is switched on. 
    To select the keyfollow just point to which value you require.

    If you are familiar with the CZ range you will know that we 
can have two voices, to set up the second voice frist select 
voice2 in the FILE 2 menu heading the page will look the same 
apart from any settings you have made. So that you know which 
VOICE you are editing at the top right there are two headings 
called VOICE  and SOUND, VOICE will show 1 or 2     SOUND 
indicates which SOUND or instrument you are editing in the range 1 
to 16. At the bottom is the name of the sound which you can set. 
To move to another sound use the EDIT SOUND menu heading the sound 
number and sound name are shown to help obtain the correct sound.
