   The Spelling Program (SPELL.PRG) on this disc is written entirely in
Fast Basic.It has been converted into a stand-alone program using the 
'TAGGER' routine on the FB Run-time Disc. A copy of the source code
is also included.

   The RAM DISK is installed by the program in the AUTO folder, which 
is from the Public Domain.

   The SPEECH utility is from the Fast Basic Language Disk.

   Loading and using the program is described in the TUTORIAL.DOC file
on this disc.

   I hope you enjoy this prog. If you want to use it as a demo in your
FAST BASIC PD collection, you have my full permission to do so. Also,
if this prog. is good enough to merit a free Disc, I would like the 
FAST GRAPHICS AND MATHS 1, please.

   The development steps to produce the final prog. were -

1. Design, draw and save the main screen (Fast Basic)
2. Design and write an art utility to draw and save the pictures, then
     bank them up on one screen (16 pictures = 1 screen = 1 grade).
     (Fast Basic)
3. Write the main program. (Fast Basic)
4. Link in the speech routines, and utilise a RAM Disc to avoid
     loading picture screens from disc. (Fast Basic + PD Utility)

   The whole thing took about six months, at least half of that being
spent in drawing the pictures.

   Finally, I have been using Fast Basic for about two years. It is
an excellent version of a popular language,and one of the best buys
I ever made for my ST.  

                             Cheers,

                                   Peter Jackson
