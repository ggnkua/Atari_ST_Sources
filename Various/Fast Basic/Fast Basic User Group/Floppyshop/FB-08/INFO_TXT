
THIS DISK ORIGINATED FROM FAST
------------------------------

This Disk is SHAREWARE as of 10-11-89

Originally this disk was not Public 
Domain but since the close down of FaST 
there seems little point in trying to 
selling as an independent item.

This set of routines was being sold at 
4.95 exclusively to members. However, now 
it is in the hands of the PD libraries. 

If you bought this disk please send a 
contribution to Martin for his hard work.
