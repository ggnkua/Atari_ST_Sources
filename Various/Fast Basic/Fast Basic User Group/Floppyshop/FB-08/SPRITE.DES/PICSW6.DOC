PicSwitch ST Picture Utility
(c)1986 John Brochu for Advanced Software

Version: 0.6
Released: June 11, 1986

FOR COLOR SYSTEMS ONLY

PicSwitch 0.6 is distributed as SHAREWARE.  You are encouraged to freely
distribute the program.


This version reads the following file formats:

     o  DEGAS................................. [.PI1-.PI3]
     o  NeoChrome.................................. [.NEO]
     o  NVision.................. [.SC0-2, .CL0-2, .PG0-2]
     o  Amiga IFF low- & med-rez................... [.IFF]
     o  MacPaint................................... [.MAC]
     o  Mac Startup screen......................... [.MAS]
     o  CIS Vidtex hi-rez RLE...................... [.RLE]


And writes the following ST file formats:

     o  DEGAS
     o  NeoChrome
     o  NeoChrome 'page' (for NVision)


All pics can be saved in ANY resolution, with automatic conversion to the
selected resolution.  Conversions from a higher rez to a lower rez are
automatically optimized using a color averaging technique for best results.
Conversions from hi-rez allow you the option of saving the picture using the
full palette (best if you may want to restore the pic to its original state at
a later date) or with the minimum possible palette (low-rez conversions would
use 5 colors, med-rez 3).

MacPaint files are also allowed a fourth save option.  Compressed save allows
you to 'squeeze' a full 720-line MacPaint document into only 240 high-quality
med-rez lines, thus losing only 15% of the picture.

In all cases, you are allowed to 'Preview' the conversion before saving it,
without affecting the original picture.  Monochrome previews will display the
picture in PicSwitch's 'simulated monochrome' mode, but will actually save in
monochrome format for use on the Atari SM124 monitor (or for further use with
PicSwitch!).


Using the program
-----------------
To load a picture using the GEM file selector, double click on its filename or
single-click and then click OK.  The file will load and display.  (If it is a
monochrome ST or Mac picture, the file will display in med-rez 'simulated
mono'.)  At this point you can press 'Help' for a list of available keyboard
commands.  Following is an explanation of all the commands:

For all pics...
o   [Undo] or the right mouse button:  exits the pic and returns you to the
       file selector.
o   [Help]:  displays the command list.
o   [I]:  displays the information screen.
o   [S]:  displays the save dialog.
o   [P]:  dumps a color or monochrome screen to the printer.  To use this
       option, you must have a DEGAS printer driver with a ".PRT" extender
       tresent in the directory the program is in.  The [Alt] key works
       as in DEGAS, ie.[P] prints a full page, [Alt-P] prints a half-page.
       Pressing [Undo] during a print aborts the dump.
o   [M]:  dumps a monochrome screen or page to the printer.  [Undo] aborts
a printout.  The default printer type is of course Epson/Atari dot
matrix.  Other printers capable of 8-bit graphics can be configured
using a ".PSW" driver described later.

For Amiga IFF pics...
o   [1]-[6]:  selects the bit-planes to be displayed.
o   [Space]:  cycles through settings [1]-[6].
o   [R],[G],[B]:  boosts the selected color.
o   [Return]:  restores the default planes and colors.
Low-rez 32-color pics have 5 'planes' or 5 bits of color-register selection.
Keys 1-5 'pull out' one of the planes for display on the ST's 4-plane hardware.
Med-rez 16-color pics have 4 planes.  Keys 1-6 in med-rez therefore need to
pull out 2 planes at a time.  The following table summarizes the planes that
are displayed.  The space bar cycles through each in turn.
     +-----+---------+-----+
     | key |   low   | med |
     +-----+---------+-----+
     |  1  | 1,2,3,4 | 2,3 |
     |  2  | 0,2,3,4 | 1,3 |
     |  3  | 0,1,3,4 | 1,2 |
     |  4  | 0,1,2,4 | 0,3 |
     |  5  | 0,1,2,3 | 0,2 |
     |  6  | ---na-- | 0,1 |
     +-----+---------+-----+
Amiga's hardware also allows 4-bit color resolution, or 16 levels each of red,
green, and blue.  Since the ST only has 3-bit resolution, each IFF RGB color
palette entry is cut in half to bring it into the ST's range.  The R,G,B keys
add one to the IFF value before halving it.  This helps bring out some of the
detail that may be lost if some of the registers convert to the same color.

For MacPaint pics...
o   Pressing the left mouse button activates a 'grabber' similar to Neo's.
o   C - Compress the picture vertically.  Note this is also available from
     the Save dialog;  however, this command allows you to scroll the
     picture with the grabber before saving.  Pressing this a second time
     restores the original pic.

For NVision pics...
o   Pressing the left mouse button activates the grabber.


Printer Drivers
---------------
Printer drivers are loaded automatically when you first run the program.  The
file extenders ".PRT" and ".PSW" are searched for in the current directory
(this allows you to have all PicSwitch-related files in one folder if you
like).  The first file of each type that was written to that directory is
loaded.  A PRT file is necessary to use the screen [P]rint command.  These are
the stand-alone DEGAS printer drivers written by Tom Hudson that are available
on most public boards.  A PSW file is only necessary to use the [M]ono print
command if you do not have an Epson-compatible printer.

The mono driver in the current version of PicSwitch only supports 8-pin
graphics and 960 dots per line density.  PSW files are text files containing
the decimal ascii codes necessary for setting up your printer for graphics.
All PSW files must have three command lines separated by a single carriage
return.  Only the ascii characters 0-9, L, l, H, h, <comma>, <space>, and CR/LF
are recognized;  all other characters are ignored.  Each printer code must be
separated by a space or comma delimiter.  A maximum of 32 codes are allowed on
each line.

The first line contains the decimal codes for initializing your printer for
graphics.  These codes are sent to the printer only once at the start of a
graphics dump.  The second line is sent before every line of graphics and tells
the printer how many columns of data are to follow.  The third and final line
is sent after the last line is printed and restores the printer to normal
operation.

The following is a sample PSW file (EPSON defaults):
27 51 23
27 76 L H
27 50

The 1st line: <ESC> "3" 23, tells the Epson to set the line spacing in 216ths
inch increments, to 23/216 of an inch.  You could substitute any line spacing
command you like here.  I found this setting worked very well in getting rid of
the dreaded white lines.  (24/216 or 8/72 is the more 'correct' setting to use
here since the Epson's pin spacing is 1/72 inch.)

The 2nd line: <ESC> "L" L H, tells the Epson to print (L+256*H) columns of 960
dots per line graphics.  You need not be concerned with the actual 'L'ow and
'H'igh values here, PicSwitch will substitute the correct values for L and H
according to how long the actual line of picture data is.  Just make sure you
put the L and H in the correct place for your printer.  Note you MUST use 960
dots per line density.

The 3rd line: <ESC> "2", tells the Epson to return to the original 1/6 of an
inch line spacing.  You could also use a 'reset' command here (<ESC> "@" for
the Epson) if you wish.

A line feed is sent at the end of each completed printer dump.  If the printer
is not available, the console bell will sound.

All printouts done with either [P]rint or [M]onoprint are printed in the
ORIGINAL picture's resolution, not from screen memory.  This allows mono pics
to be printed with no loss of resolution.  MacPaint pics cannot be printed in
compressed mode unless you first save the file in compressed form, reload it,
then print it out with the [P] command.  Remember, the [M] command is for
monochrome prints only, either full-page MacPaint or NVision monochrome, or
mono DEGAS or Neo screens.  The [P] command prints ALL single screen pictures
using a DEGAS driver.  If the picture is a full-page image, the section of the
pic currently displayed is what gets printed.

Well, I guess that covers it for this version!  I have tried to include
everyone's suggestions in 0.6, many thanks to everyone who took the time to
write me.  As always, I can be reached on GEnie [JAKOB] and Compuserve
[70376,1235] or you can write me at the address below.  If you have any
comments or ideas, I'd like to hear from you!
