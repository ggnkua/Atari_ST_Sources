
COPY.  In COPY mode you will see a cross. Press the LEFT mouse button and drag
the cross up and to the left until the frame covers the required area. Release
the button and press it again to "TAKE".  "TAKE" -> "COPY" and you now see the
image and locating co-ordinates of the corner of the frame.  Use the mouse  to
move  the  image and press the LEFT button to "COPY" it. Leave  COPY  mode  by
pressing the RIGHT button.   The image is still in memory and you can transfer
it to another drawing.
       To  reactivate COPY mode,  press CONTROL/LEFT SHIFT  or LEFT button  on
"COPY". The whole image must be above the bottom line.  RIGHT button on "COPY"
will return you to "DRAW". 
       The MODE box on the left is either 'SET' or 'FREE'.   'SET' offers  the
most useful mode [D] where image replaces background. [H] combines image  with
background  (transparent).   The locating  co-ordinates  are very useful here.
Click  on 'SET' to change to 'FREE' and vice versa.  In 'FREE' mode  you  must 
enter  a  letter  (A  - P) or you can abort with the Space  Bar  or  [Return]. 
        ALTERNATE  gives  five  actions. ROTATE, ZOOM, CIRCLE, STAR & POLYGON.
For [ROTATE] or [ZOOM] point the arrow and press where you wish  to  PUT   the 
image  (LEFT button).  Press the LEFT button again (anywhere) for the ANGLE of
rotation or SIZE and hold it  down.   Release LEFT and press RIGHT button,  to 
stop and then WAIT for rotation or change in size to take place.  For POLYGON,
STAR  etc, use the  LEFT  button.                   Now press the [Space Bar].
