
TALK.  Use [Delete] or [Backspace] for erase.      [Clr/Home] clears text and, 
pressed twice,  returns to DRAW, file deleted.   [Undo]  restores an undeleted
file.  Press [Return] to check the finished text and [Return] again to save to
disc. [Enter] saves directly to disc.  [Insert]  saves to  RAM  and returns to
text. Since  the length of a message is limited by  SPEAK.PRG,   the  text  is
broken  up into lengths of 125 characters.  At the end of a section, you  will
hear a bell and see '|'.  Don't allow this bar to intersect a word; the  voice
will interpret it as two separate words.  [Tab] sets control of the action  in 
the first three characters of text.  
  See '.??',  '!??' and '\??' in succession when you press [Tab]:-
'!' switches Voice OFF.       | First  '?' = delay time. 0 is fast, 9 is slow.
'\' splits text into 4 levels.| Second '?' = number of repeats (Voice Off)  OR
'.' = No action.              | Actions:- '!'= Voice OFF.  '~'= Random change.
                              | '#' = Return to start     0 - 9 = Delay/Repeat
'>' = Forward  '<' = Reverse  | '/' = Starts to reverse now.
Space bar gives '.' No action | '*' = random ending = either 'H' or 'I'.
At all levels EXCEPT 1, the first character after the bar gives action.  Delay
time and repeat (Voice OFF) are set alternately as indicated.
[Control/Left Shift] gives TEXT ON/TEXT OFF with voice playback. With TEXT ON, 
press [Alternate] to move to next frame.  To correct text,  press [Left Shift] 
and click on TALK. Press [Right Shift] for VOICE ON/VOICE OFF Animation only.
                                                       Now press the SPACE BAR.
