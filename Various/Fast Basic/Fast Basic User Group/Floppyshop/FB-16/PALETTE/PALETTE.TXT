DOCUMENTATION FOR "PALETTE.BSC" AND "RES_PALT.BSC"

     These two programs are extremely simple,  but can be useful; 
I normally keep them loaded into spare segments on the FAST BASIC 
desktop while I am writing or running programs.
     PALETTE.BSC is simply a chart showing the current palette; I 
wrote it as a simple tool to help me choose suitable colours  for 
other programs.  It's often useful to run it from a spare segment 
whenever  I need to change INK,  etc colours and  can't  remember 
which index represents which colour.  Having viewed the chart,  a 
simple key-press restores the desktop.
     RES_PALT.BSC  is an extended version of PALETTE.BSC  and  is 
designed for the annoying situation whereby a program alters  the 
colour palette such that the desktop is returned  with,  perhaps, 
red lettering on a green background. Having found this a constant 
nuisance,  when using FAST BASIC,  I decided it would be a simple 
matter  to  write  a  short program that could  be  run  in  such 
situations, to restore the normal palette.
     You simply keep it in a spare segment, run it when necessary 
and  press  any key when indicated.  The first screen  shows  the 
current  palette  and a key-press restores the  standard  one;  a 
further press exits.
     As I don't like the FAST BASIC default palette,  which  I've 
never  found  to  be useful,  I always keep to  the  standard  ST 
CONTROL  PANEL  colours.  RES_PALT is configured to  restore  the 
latter, though I've certainly no objection to anyone altering the 
BASIC code to suit their own choice of colours.
