THE GAME
Two packs of cards are shuffled and
dealt into eight seperate piles. The
top card of each pile is placed above
these piles, and is known as the index
card. 
Cards are built up from the index card,
with the Ace following the King. Suits
are ignored when building. Building
continues until the card rank below
that of the index card. Any card from
thepiles can be used and are placed
ABOVE the index cards.
When no more cards can be played, the
first pile is lifted and dealt, one
card at a time, from the left, over
ALL the lower piles. The next time play
is stopped, the second pile is redealt,
and so on, up to the eighth pile.
THE OBJECT
The object is to get rid of all the
cards in the piles. As this is fairly
difficult to do, the computer game
gives a score, which is the number of
cards left.
THE COMPUTER GAME
(Click refers to the left mouse button)
Click on the top left card to deal. Use
this card to redeal. After "0 deals
left" use this card to end the game.
To move a card, click on it. The
pointed finger will change, to show you
have picked it up. Move the hand to
where you want to place it, and click.
The computer will not allow you to
cheat!
THE HI-SCORE TABLE
If you have fewer cards left than any
of the table, you can enter your name.
The table is saved on disc. It is not
impossible to get rid of all the cards
before the last redeal. This is taken
into account in the score, and
naturally will head the table.

Enjoy this addictive patience.
