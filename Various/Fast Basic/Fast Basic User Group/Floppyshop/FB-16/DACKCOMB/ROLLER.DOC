        This program will rotate any ordinary NEO type picture on-screen in
real-time using a simple M/C routine. Once the program is running, you will
see a rather squashed looking Mona Lisa picture appear. At first the 'drum'
on which the picture can be visualised as wrapped around, is stationary. To
make it roll press the up and down cursors to accelerate it in the required
direction. It's a totally useless program as far as I can see, but it's fun
to play around with!
        What the program does is mind-bogglingly simple: a screen is stored
in memory from which horizontal lines are taken in pre-determined positions
which are then displayed on the VDU one after the other. A cosine function
is used to produce the roll effect. You can alter the shape of the drum by
storing an offset to the next screen line in a word array pointed to by the
label TABLE (bear in mind that in colour resolutions, a screen line is 160
bytes long, so the offset to the line below would be 160).
        Various parameters can be adjusted to alter the size and position
of the drum. ROLLX and ROLLY are the X-Y coordinates of the top-left corner
of the drum (note that ROLLX works only within 16-pixel boundaries) whilst
ROLLW and ROLLH alter the width and height of the drum (note also that the
ROLLW is measured in 16-pixel units). PICTX determines the leftmost column
of the picture to be displayed on the screen. MAXPOSN determines the size
of the picture (the default of 32000 shows one whole screen). PICPOSN is
used internally to point to the starting position of the picture, and will
wrap around when it reaches the ends. ROTATION specifies how fast the drum
will be made to rotate bewteen calls. Usually, this will be 160*the number
of screen lines. Lastly, PICTURE is the picture address, and LOGBASE the
logical screen base.
