        Okay, so you've created a graphical masterpiece - now what can you
do? Well, why not take it into a new dimension with the 3D Contour Mapper!
Just load in a standard NEO or PI1 lo-res picture file and the program will
protrude each colour to a certain height - colours are treated like contour
lines on a map. Eventually, you will have a modest 3D representation of the
original picture. Sounds good? Well, it is!
        When the program is up and running, you will be presented with the
main menu. There are seven menu headings avaliable - Load and Save Picture,
Quit Program, Define Window, Smooth Window, Set Grid and Draw Picture.
        Load, Save and Quit are pretty obvious. Before starting any picture
processing, there must be a picture file already stored in memory. Saving a
picture file will use the same format as that of the previously loaded one.
The extension will automatically be added on.
        Set Window defines the window of the picture you wish to transform.
Move the mouse pointer to the top-left hand corner of the window, and click
the left button. Holding down the left button still, move the pointer until
the required portion is enclosed. Press the button again to re-position the
box.
        When you have defined a window, you may then smooth out the colour
boundaries to produce a smoother contour picture. Since the smoothing only
takes into consideration the colour indexes, you may find some odd colours
popping up here and there.
        Set Grid allows you to position the resulting 3D image. Because the
ST running Fast Basic cannot come anywhere near to moving the image in real
time, a grid is used to represent the image instead. There are various keys
that control the grid:

        Cursor Up       Move the viewpoint upwards.   | Pressing shift and
        Cursor Down     Move the viewpoint downwards. | any of these keys
        Cursor Left     Move the viewpoint left.      | simultaneously you
        Cursor Right    Move the viewpoint right.     | can position the
        Insert          Advance viewpoint to grid.    | viewpoint in finer
        Clr/Home        Retreat viewpoint from grid.  | steps.

        X,Y or Z        Rotate the grid around the
                        corresponding axis. Holding
                        shift will rotate the grid
                        in the opposite direction.

        A               Increase the angle of rotation.
                        Shift+A to decrease this angle.
        F1,F2,F3        Enlarge the grid in the X,Y and Z
                        axis respectively. Hold shift to
                        reduce the grid size.
        F4              Increase depth of picture. Shift
                        plus F4 to decrease depth.
        F9              Restore the grid to its default
                        size and position.
        F10             Rotate the grid to its default
                        orientation.
        HELP            Show various grid parameters.

        RETURN          Return to main menu.

        Draw Picture actually does the biz. Here you will be asked a few
questions about the final image before drawing takes place via a series of
alert boxes. Pressing ESC whilst drawing is in progress will abandon the
drawing. The short delay you will experience lies in the fact that I could
not find a way of exiting the procedure without going through the entire
FOR..NEXT loop!

        Surface Respesentation:Select the type of surface you want. There
                               is a choice of Hollow, Solid or Lined. When
                               lined is selected, you will be asked which
                               direction you want the lines to point in.

        Colouring Mode:        Here you select what type of colouring you
                               want used - Norm, Mono or Light. Norm uses
                               the colours of the original picture, whilst
                               Mono uses colour one (GEM) for everything.
                               Light lets you define a light source that
                               will (hopefully!) shine onto the image and
                               make it look more solid. When this is chosen,
                               enter the light source coordinates, relative
                               to the grid. When this is done, more alert
                               boxes pop up asking you for the colour of the
                               lighting. You have the choice of red, green,
                               blue, white and yellow.

        Grid Locking:          When you want a rough view of how the final
                               image will look, choose scale factor 8, which
                               jumps in 8-pixel steps across and down the
                               picture. Drawing time is considerably quicker
                               that using a scale of 1. 4 is an intermediate
                               stage, and gives good results when using a
                               light source.

        That covers all the menu options, so have fun using the program won't
you! Oh, by the way - try to make sure the image is constructed back-to-front
else wierd things can happen! To avoid this, it is necessary to sort every
surface into order of distance from the viewer, but is too time consuming and
memory hungry. The funny looking V-shape on the grid points to the top of the
picture, and also serves to show how high colour index 15 will be when the
image has been drawn.
