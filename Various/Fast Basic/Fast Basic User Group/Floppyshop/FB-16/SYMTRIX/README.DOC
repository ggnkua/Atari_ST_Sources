PROGRAM NOTES

All programs written in Fast Basic.
I've  sprinkled the programs with REM's to try to help you to  see whats
happening.

Three   of  the  program's  use  the  POLYGON  command,to   create 
triangular  symmetrical  patterns,plotted around the centre  of  the 
screen   and   the  main  procedures  are   concerned   with   the 
plotting,scaling and showing of these patterns.
The  other  program draws symmetrical lines of  patterns  and  was 
adapted  to  fast  basic and colour from the book" Atari ST graphics
& sound" from Abacus.

PROGRAM :RECSTARS

I  can't  claim that this is an original idea  of  mine.There  are 
various  examples  of  "Koch  Flakes",in  a  variety  of   graphic 
programming books,although I haven't seen one on an Atari before.
This program is the first one I transposed over from my Beeb(about 
18 months ago). The first  thing  I  found out about fast basic is that
there is no command  to  change  the graphic origin from  the  top  left  hand 
corner,to anywhere on the screen,as on the Beeb. Makes plotting so much
easier. Therefore my algorithyms for plotting and scaling are somewhat
laboured.

The  program is an example of recursion and draws a series of  six 
sided stars by repeatly drawing smaller stars on the arms of stars 
already drawn. 
To draw a Six sided star.  I've used the POLYGON command to create 
two  triangles,one inverted and offset horizontally.  To  use  the 
polygon command, data must be entered into two arrays(word length) 
and called with the syntax:-
POLYGON <no.  of points>,<address of X array>,<address of Y array> 

For  a triangle 3 sets of X and Y co-ordinates will be  needed.  2 
for each point
i.e.DATA 100,50,150,100,100,150
POLYGON 3,@X&(0),@Y&(0)
This will plot a filled triangle at the above screen co-ordinates.
   
The procedure PROCstar(Xpos,Ypos,size of first star,colour),will
repeatedly call itself. Recursion is stopped when S%<1.
The  variables  leftx%,rightx%,topy%,boty%,offset%  together  with 
SW%,SH%  are  used  to  plot  the  co-ordinates  and   symmetrical 
scaling. 
Then the palette is changed at random to see the effect of the flakes.
A small delay is introduced  to  slow  the effect down.
 


PROGRAM : PULSAR3

This program although showing a different graphic effect is very
similar to the previous one. The plotting of the co-ordinates are
done  in  the  same way and again POLYGON is  used  to  print  the 
triangles  on the screen.  An eight sided star in this  case,which 
requires  two arrays X&,Y& to hold 24 co-ordinates each.  The  same 
variable names as in the previous program are used,to do the plot-
ting. L1%,L2% introduce a random element and 2 loop structures are
used  to  plot outward and then inward towards the centre  of  the 
screen.  The colour palette is also randomly changed.  PROCpoly as 
well as drawing the pattern also randomly changes colour,grafmode
and fillstyle. The program can be slowed down to suit, there are
REM'S in front of delay loops in the program.


PROGRAM : KAL4

This program although similar in concept to PULSAR uses transform-
ation  techniques to plot the co-ordinates relative to the  centre 
of the screen. This makes for a simpler algorithym and programming
style.PROCmain is a loop structure which sets random colours,grafmode
triangle length,etc. PROCplot passes the co-ordinate parameters to 
PROCtranspoint which as well as setting the graphic origin to the centre
of the screen works out the co-ordinate conversion(e.g  PLOT 0,0 
would plot a dot in the centre of the  screen and not in the top left
hand corner).PROCplot also puts the converted co-ordinates,held in
variables x,y into arrays X&,Y& and calls PROCpoly which does the
drawing.
For a fuller description of transformation techniques I can re-
commend the  Data Becker/Abacus book "ATARI ST GRAPHIC & SOUND".
 
   
PROGRAM : KRAZYPAT

This program is one I have adapted to Fast Basic and colour from
the  above  book.  It  uses line  drawing  to  create  symmetrical 
patterns on the screen. The variables xm,ym,x,y,x1,y1 do the plot-
ting and scaling. If x or y =0,or the space bar is pressed,a new
pattern is started.
