primitive r-variate integral polynomial.  M is a positive integer.

,(x sub rl- 1)**(d sub r - 1)) such that if B is an integral factor
of A, then H sub M,I (B) is an associate of some product of elements
of L.  D is either 0, or a characteristic set for the possible degrees
of integral factors of A.  LP is a list of the primitive irreducible
integral factors of A. *)

square-free integral polynomial.  C is the intersection of
the degree sets of factorizations over Z sub p for as many as NPFDS
primes p (fewer only if SMPRM is exhausted or A is proved irredu-
cible). C is represented as a characteristic set.  p is
the least examined prime in P which gave the smallest number of
factors, and F is the distinct degree factorization of A over Z sub p,
unless A is shown to be irreducible, in which case p=0, F=().*)
