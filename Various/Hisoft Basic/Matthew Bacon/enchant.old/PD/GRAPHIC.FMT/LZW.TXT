			LZW and GIF explained
			   Steve Blackstock


I hope this little document will help enlighten those of you out there
who   want to   know   more  about the   Lempel-Ziv  Welch compression
algorithm,  and, specifically,   the  implementation that  GIF   uses.
Before we start, here's a little terminology, for the purposes of this
document:

      "character"  a fundamental data element. In normal text files,
		   this is just a single byte. In raster images, which
		   is what we're interested in, it's an index that
		   specifies the color of a given pixel. I'll refer to
		   an arbitray character as "K".

      "charstream" a stream of characters, as in a data file.

      "string"  a number of continuous characters, anywhere from one to
		very many characters in length. I can specify an
		arbitrary string as "[...]K".

      "prefix"  almost the same as a string, but with the implication
		that a prefix immediately precedes a character, and a
		prefix can have a length of zero. So, a prefix and a
		character make up a string. I will refer to an
		arbitrary prefix as "[...]".

      "root"    a single-character string. For most purposes, this is a
		character, but we may occasionally make a distinction.
		It is [...]K, where [...] is empty.

      "code"    a number, specified by a known number of bits, which
	        maps to a string.

      "codestream"  the output stream of codes, as in the "raster data".

      "entry"   a code and its string.

      "string table" a list of entries; usually, but not necessarily,
		     unique.


LZW is a way of compressing data that takes advantage of repetition of
strings in the data. Since raster data usually contains  a lot of this
repetition,  LZW is a good  way  of compressing and decompressing  it.
For the moment, lets consider  normal LZW encoding and decoding. GIF's
variation on the concept is just an extension from there.

LZW manipulates three  objects in both  compression and decompression:
the charstream, the codestream, and  the string table. In compression,
the  charstream is the  input and  the   codestream is the output.  In
decompression,  the codestream is the input  and the charstream is the
output.  The string  table  is  a  product  of both    compression and
decompression, but is never passed from one to the other.

The first thing  we do in LZW compression  is   initialize our  string
table.  To do this, we need to choose a code size (how many  bits) and
know how many  values our characters  can possibly take. Let's say our
code size is 12 bits, meaning we can store 0->FFF,  or 4096 entries in
our  string table.  Lets also  say that we  have 32 possible different
characters. (This corresponds to, say, a picture in which there are 32
different colors possible for each pixel.) To initialize the table, we
set code#0 to  character#0, code #1 to character#1,  and  so on, until
code#31 to character#31. Actually,  we  are specifying that  each code
from 0  to 31 maps to a  root. There  will be  no  more entries in the
table that have this property.

Now we start compressing data. Let's first define something called the
"current prefix". It's  just  a prefix that  we'll store things in and
compare  things to now  and then. I   will  refer  to it  as  "[.c.]".
Initially, the current prefix has nothing  in  it. Let's also define a
"current string",   which  will be the current   prefix  plus the next
character in the  charstream. I will refer to  the  current string  as
"[.c.]K", where K is some character. OK, look  at the  first character
in the charstream. Call  it P. Make  [.c.]P the  current  string.  (At
this point, of course, it's just the root  P.) Now search  through the
string table to see if [.c.]P appears in it.  Of  course, it does now,
because our string table is initialized to have all roots. So we don't
do anything.  Now  make [.c.]P the   current prefix. Look at the  next
character in the charstream. Call it  Q. Add it  to the current prefix
to form [.c.]Q,  the current string.   Now search  through  the string
table  to see if  [.c.]Q  appears in it.  In this case, of course,  it
doesn't. Aha! Now we get to do something.  Add [.c.]Q (which  is PQ in
this case)  to the string  table for code#32, and  output the code for
[.c.] to the codestream. Now start over again  with the current prefix
being just the root P. Keep adding characters to [.c.] to form [.c.]K,
until you can't find [.c.]K in the string table. Then  output the code
for [.c.]  and add  [.c.]K  to the string table.  In pseudo-code,  the
algorithm goes something like this:

     [1] Initialize string table;
     [2] [.c.] <- empty;
     [3] K <- next character in charstream;
     [4] Is [.c.]K in string table?
      (yes: [.c.] <- [.c.]K;
            go to [3];
      )
      (no: add [.c.]K to the string table;
           output the code for [.c.] to the codestream;
           [.c.] <- K;
           go to [3];
      )

It's as simple as that! Of course, when you get to step  [3] and there
aren't  any more characters left,  you just output  the code for [.c.]
and throw the table away. You're done.

Wanna do an example? Let's  pretend we have a four-character alphabet:
A,B,C,D. The charstream looks like ABACABA.  Let's compress it. First,
we initialize  our string table to: #0=A,  #1=B, #2=C, #3=D. The first
character is A, which is in the string table, so [.c.] becomes A. Next
we get  AB,  which  is not  in the table,  so we  output code  #0 (for
[.c.]), and add AB  to the string table  as code #4. [.c.]  becomes B.
Next we get [.c.]A = BA, which is  not in the  string table, so output
code #1, and add BA to  the string table as code  #5. [.c.] becomes A.
Next we get AC, which is not in the string table.  Output code #0, and
add AC to the string  table  as code #6. Now  [.c.] becomes C. Next we
get [.c.]A = CA, which is not in the table.  Output #2  for C, and add
CA to table as code#7. Now [.c.] becomes A.  Next we  get AB, which IS
in the string table,  so [.c.] gets AB,  and we look at ABA,  which is
not in the string table, so output the code for  AB,  which is #4, and
add ABA to the string table as code #8. [.c.] becomes A. We  can't get
any more characters,  so we just output #0  for   the code for  A, and
we're done. So, the codestream is #0#1#0#2#4#0.

A few words (four) should be said here about efficiency: use a hashing
strategy.  The search through the string  table can be computationally
intensive, and some hashing is well worth the effort.  Also, note that
"straight  LZW" compression runs  the  risk of  overflowing the string
table - getting to a code which can't be represented in  the number of
bits you've set aside for codes.   There  are several  ways of dealing
with this problem, and GIF implements a very clever one, but we'll get
to that.

An  important   thing to  notice is  that, at any   point  during  the
compression, if  [...]K  is in the  string table, [...] is there also.
This fact  suggests  an efficient  method  for  storing strings in the
table.  Rather than store  the  entire string  of K's  in  the  table,
realize that any string can be expressed as a prefix plus a character:
[...]K. If  we're  about to  store [...]K  in the  table, we know that
[...] is already there, so we  can just store the  code for [...] plus
the final character K.

That  takes   care  of compression.   Decompression   is  perhaps more
difficult conceptually, but it is really easier  to program.  We again
have to start with an initialized  string table. This table comes from
what knowledge  we have about the  charstream  that we will eventually
get, like what possible values the characters  can take. In GIF files,
this information  is in the  header as the  number  of  possible pixel
values. The  beauty of  LZW, though, is  that this is   all we need to
know. We will build the rest of the string table  as we decompress the
codestream. The compression is done  in such a way that  we will never
encounter a code  in the  codestream  that we  can't translate  into a
string.

We  need to define   something called a  "current code",  which I will
refer  to as  "<code>", and an "old-code", which  I will   refer to as
"<old>". To start  things  off, look at  the first  code.  This is now
<code>. This code will be in the intialized string  table  as the code
for a  root.  Output the root  to the charstream.   Make this code the
old-code <old>. *Now look at the next code, and make  it <code>. It is
possible that  this code will  not be  in the string table, but  let's
assume for now that it is.  Output the  string corresponding to <code>
to the codestream. Now find the first character in the string you just
translated. Call this K.  Add this  to  the prefix [...]  generated by
<old>  to form  a  new string [...]K.   Add this string  [...]K to the
string table, and set the old-code <old>  to the current  code <code>.
Repeat from where I typed the asterisk,  and you're all set. Read this
paragraph again if you just skimmed it!!!

Now  let's consider the possibility  that <code> is  not in the string
table.  Think back to compression, and try  to understand what happens
when you have a string like  P[...]P[...]PQ  appear in the charstream.
Suppose P[...] is already in the string table, but P[...]P is not. The
compressor will parse out P[...], and find that P[...]P is  not in the
string table. It will output the  code for P[...],  and add P[...]P to
the string table.  Then it will get up to P[...]P for the next string,
and find that P[...]P is in the table, as  the code  just added. So it
will output the code for P[...]P if it finds  that P[...]PQ is  not in
the   table.   The decompressor   is always   "one  step behind"   the
compressor.  When the decompressor sees the code  for P[...]P, it will
not have added  that  code to it's string table  yet because it needed
the beginning character of P[...]P to  add  to the string for the last
code,  P[...],   to  form  the  code  for  P[...]P.   However, when  a
decompressor finds a code that it doesn't  know yet, it will always be
the very next one to be added to the string  table. So it can guess at
what the string for the code should  be, and,  in fact, it will always
be correct. If  I am a decompressor, and  I  see code#124,  and yet my
string  table has entries only up  to code#123, I  can figure out what
code#124 must be, add it to my string table, and output the string. If
code#123 generated the string, which I will refer to here as a prefix,
[...], then code#124,  in this special  case,  will be [...]  plus the
first character of [...].  So just add the first character of [...] to
the end of itself. Not too bad.  As an example (and a very common one)
of this special case, let's assume we have a raster image in which the
first three pixels have  the same color value.  That is, my charstream
looks  like: QQQ....

For the sake of argument, let's say  we  have 32 colors, and  Q is the
color#12.  The compressor will generate  the code  sequence 12,32,....
(if you don't know why, take a minute to understand it.) Remember that
#32 is not  in the  initial table, which   goes from #0  to  #31.  The
decompressor will see #12 and translate it  just fine as color Q. Then
it will see #32 and  not yet know what  that means.  But  if it thinks
about it long enough, it can figure out  that QQ should be entry#32 in
the   table and  QQ  should  be  the  next  string  output.    So  the
decompression pseudo-code goes something like:

     [1] Initialize string table;
     [2] get first code: <code>;
     [3] output the string for <code> to the charstream;
     [4] <old> = <code>;
     [5] <code> <- next code in codestream;
     [6] does <code> exist in the string table?
      (yes: output the string for <code> to the charstream;
            [...] <- translation for <old>;
            K <- first character of translation for <code>;
            add [...]K to the string table;        <old> <- <code>;  )
      (no: [...] <- translation for <old>;
           K <- first character of [...];
           output [...]K to charstream and add it to string table;
           <old> <- <code>
      )
     [7] go to [5];

Again,  when you get to step  [5] and there  are no more codes, you're
finished.  Outputting of strings, and finding of initial characters in
strings are efficiency problems all  to themselves, but I'm not  going
to  suggest ways  to do  them  here.  Half the  fun  of programming is
figuring these things out!

Now for  the GIF variations  on the theme. In  part of the header of a
GIF file, there  is a  field, in the  Raster Data stream, called "code
size".  This is a very  misleading name for  the field, but we have to
live with it. What it  is really is the "root  size". The actual size,
in   bits,  of     the compression  codes  actually    changes  during
compression/decompression, and I will refer  to that size  here as the
"compression size".  The initial table is just  the codes for all  the
roots, as  usual, but  two  special  codes are  added on top of those.
Suppose you have a  "code  size", which is usually  the number of bits
per pixel in the image, of N. If the number of bits/pixel is one, then
N must be 2: the roots take up  slots #0  and #1 in the initial table,
and the two special  codes will take up slots  #4 and #5. In any other
case, N is the number of bits  per pixel, and  the roots take up slots
#0 through #(2**N-1), and the special codes are (2**N) and (2**N + 1).
The initial compression size  will be N+1 bits   per  code.  If you're
encoding, you output the codes (N+1) bits at a time to start with, and
if you're decoding, you grab (N+1) bits from the codestream at a time.
As for  the  special codes: <CC>  or  the  clear code, is  (2**N), and
<EOI>, or end-of-information, is (2**N + 1). <CC> tells the compressor
to re- initialize the string table, and to  reset the compression size
to (N+1). <EOI> means there's no  more  in  the codestream.  If you're
encoding  or  decoding, you should  start  adding things to the string
table at <CC> + 2. If you're  encoding, you should  output <CC> as the
very  first code, and then  whenever after that  you reach code  #4095
(hex FFF), because GIF does not allow compression sizes to  be greater
than 12 bits. If you're decoding, you  should reinitialize your string
table  when you   observe <CC>.  The   variable compression sizes  are
really no big deal. If you're encoding,  you start  with a compression
size of (N+1) bits, and, whenever you output the code (2**(compression
size)-1), you bump the compression size  up one bit.  So the next code
you output  will   be one   bit   longer.  Remember  that  the largest
compression size is 12 bits, corresponding to a  code of  4095. If you
get that far, you must output <CC> as the  next code,  and start over.
If you're decoding, you must increase your compression size AS SOON AS
YOU write entry #(2**(compression size) - 1) to the  string table. The
next code you READ will be one bit longer.  Don't make  the mistake of
waiting until you need to  add the code (2**compression  size)  to the
table.  You'll have  already missed  a bit  from  the  last code.  The
packaging of  codes  into a bitsream  for  the raster data is   also a
potential stumbling  block for   the novice  encoder  or decoder.  The
lowest order bit in the code should coincide with the lowest available
bit in the first  available byte  in the codestream. For  example,  if
you're starting with  5-bit compression  codes,  and your first  three
codes are,  say,  <abcde>, <fghij>, <klmno>,  where  e,  j, and o  are
bit#0, then your codestream will start off like:

       byte#0: hijabcde
       byte#1: .klmnofg

so  the   differences  between  straight  LZW and GIF   LZW   are: two
additional special  codes and   variable   compression sizes.  If  you
understand LZW, and you understand those variations, you understand it
all!

Just as sort of a P.S., you  may have noticed that  a compressor has a
little bit of flexibility at compression  time. I specified a "greedy"
approach to the compression, grabbing  as many characters as  possible
before outputting  codes. This is,  in fact, the  standard  LZW way of
doing things, and  it  will yield  the  best  compression   ratio. But
there's no rule saying you can't stop anywhere along the line and just
output the code  for the current  prefix, whether it's already in  the
table or  not,  and add  that  string plus the  next character  to the
string  table. There  are   various reasons   for wanting  to do this,
especially  if  the  strings  get  extremely  long  and  make  hashing
difficult.  If you need to, do it.
