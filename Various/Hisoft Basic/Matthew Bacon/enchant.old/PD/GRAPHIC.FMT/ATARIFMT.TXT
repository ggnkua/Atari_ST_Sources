* This is a very extensive listing of the most popular (and indeed  some
not so popular)  picture  file  formats  on  the  Atari,  essential  for
programmers who might require this kind of information.


 After several months of neglecting to update the list, I've made all the
 changes that were in the queue all at once.  Here's a summary of what's
 new and improved, and who contributed what:
 
         o Clarification made to IFF format (Jim Omura)
         o Spectrum Smooshed (*.SPS) format added (Shamus McBride)
         o Lars Michael's RGB Intermediate (*.RGB) format added (Lars Michael)
         o ComputerEyes Raw Data (*.CE?) format added (G. "Maddog" Knauss)
         o Animaster Sprite Bank (*.ASB) format added (Neil Forsyth)
         o STOS sprite (*.MBK) format added (me)
         o Cyber Paint Sequence (*.SEQ) format added (me)
 
 Thanks to everyone who's contributed info in the past few months! Also,
 if I've left something out, don't hesitate to let me know.  I  think  I
 got all the changes that were "on the stack" in there, but I  may  have
 missed something, so don't be bashful if I've left you out.
 
 As always, everyone is encouraged to replace older versions of The List
 with this one. This time around it's particularly  important  since  so
 many changes have been made.
 
 Thanks all,

 long    = 4 bytes
 palette = Hardware color palette, stored as 16 words.  First word is
           color register zero (background), last word is color register
           15.  Each word has the form:
 
           Bit:  (MSB) 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 (LSB)
                       -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
                        0  0  0  0  0 R2 R1 R0  0 G2 G1 G0  0 B2 B1 B0
 
           R2 = MSB of red intensity
           R0 = LSB of red intensity
 
           G2 = MSB of green intensity
           G0 = LSB of green intensity
 
           B2 = MSB of blue intensity
           B0 = LSB of blue intensity
 
           Intensity ranges from 0 (color not present) to 7 (highest
           intensity).
 
           Example: { red = 7, green = 3, blue = 5 } -> 0735 (hex)
 
           Caveat:  It is wise to mask off the upper four bits of each
                    palette entry, since a few programs store special
                    information there (most notably Art Studio).

 Compression Scheme:
  
    PackBits compression is used (see below).  Each scan line is compressed
 separately; i.e., all data for a given scan line appears before any data
 for the next scan line.  The scan lines are specified from top to bottom
 (i.e., 0 is first).  For each scan line, all the data for a given bit plane
 appears before any data for the next higher order bit plane.  Note that this
 is identical to the IFF 'BODY' image data.
    To clarify:  The first data in the file will be the data for the lowest
 order bit plane of scan line zero, followed by the data for the next higher
 order bit plane of scan line zero, etc., until all bit planes have been
 specified for scan line zero.  The next data in the file will be the data
 for the lowest order bit plane of scan line one, followed by the data for
 the next higher order bit plane of scan line one, etc., until all bit planes
 have been specified for all scan lines.
  
 Caveats:
  
    DEGAS Elite's picture loading routine places some restrictions on
 compressed DEGAS files:
  
         o Elite uses a 40-byte buffer to store data being decompressed.
  
         o Whenever a control command is encountered, bytes are stuffed
         in this buffer.
  
         o The buffer is only emptied when there are EXACTLY 40
         characters in it.
  
 The important conclusion here is that
  
         No control command may cause the buffer to have more than 40
         bytes in it.  In other words, all control commands must end on
         or before the 40-byte boundary.
  
 Any picture violating the last condition will cause Elite to get a bus
 error when the picture is loaded.
  
 
 <Tiny>  *.TNY (any resolution)
         *.TN1 (low resolution)
         *.TN2 (medium resolution)
         *.TN3 (high resolution)
 
    Several people have reported sightings of mutated Tiny pictures that
 do not follow the standard format, so let's be careful out there.  What
 is described here is the format that David Mumper's original
 TNYSTUFF.PRG produces.
 
 1 byte          resolution (same as NEO, but +3 indicates rotation
                 information also follows)
 
 If resolution > 2 {
 1 byte          left and right color animation limits.  High 4 bits
                 hold left (start) limit; low 4 bits hold right (end) limit
 1 byte          direction and speed of color animation (negative value
                 indicates left, positive indicates right, absolute value
                 is delay in 1/60's of a second.
 1 word          color rotation duration (number of iterations)
 }
 
 16 words        palette
 1 word          number of control bytes
 1 word          number of data words
 3-10667 bytes   control bytes
 1-16000 words   data words
 -------------
 42-32044 bytes  total
 
 Control byte meanings:
 
         For a given control byte, x:
 
         x < 0   Absolute value specifies the number of unique words to
                 take from the data section (from 1 to 127)
         x = 0   1 word is taken from the control section which specifies
                 the number of times to repeat the next data word (from
                 128 to 32767)
         x = 1   1 word is taken from the control section which specifies
                 the number of unique words to be taken from the data
                 section (from 128 - 32767)
         x > 1   Specifies the number of times to repeat the next word
                 taken from the data section (from 2 to 127)
 
 Format of expanded data:
 
    The expanded data is not simply screen memory bitmap data; instead, the 
 data is divided into four sets of vertical columns.  (This results in
 better compression.)  A column consists of one specific word taken
 from each scan line, going from top to bottom.  For example, column 1 
 consists of word 1 on scanline 1 followed by word 1 on scanline 2, etc., 
 followed by word 1 on scanline 200.
    The columns appear in the following order:
 
    1st set contains columns 1, 5,  9, 13, ..., 69, 73, 77 in order
    2nd set contains columns 2, 6, 10, 14, ..., 70, 74, 78 in order
    3rd set contains columns 3, 7, 11, 15, ..., 71, 75, 79 in order
    4th set contains columns 4, 8, 12, 16, ..., 72, 76, 80 in order
 
 Note that Tiny partitions the screen this way regardless of resolution; i.e., 
 these aren't bitplanes.  For example, medium resoltion only has two bitplanes, 
 but Tiny still divides medium resolution pictures into four parts.
 
 
 <Spectrum 512>  *.SPU
 
 80 words        first scan line of picture (unused) -- should be zeroes
 15920 words     picture data (screen memory) for scan lines 1 through 199
 9552 words      3 palettes for each scan line (the top scan line is
                 not included because Spectrum 512 can't display it)
 -----------
 51104 bytes     total
 
 Note that the Spectrum 512 mode's three palette changes per scan
 line allow more colors on the screen than normally possible, but a
 tremendous amount of CPU time is required to maintain the image.
 
 The Spectrum format specifies a palette of 48 colors for each scan line.
 To decode a Spectrum picture, one must be know which of these 48 colors
 are in effect for a given horizontal pixel position.
 
 Given an x-coordinate (from 0 to 319) and a color index (from 0 to 15),
 the following C function will return the proper index into the Spectrum
 palette (from 0 to 47):
 
 /*
  *  Given an x-coordinate and a color index, returns the corresponding
  *  Spectrum palette index.

  */
 int 
 FindIndex(x, c)
         int x, c;
 {
         int x1;
 
         x1 = 10 * c;
 
         if (1 & c)              /* If c is odd */
                 x1 = x1 - 5;
         else                    /* If c is even */
                 x1 = x1 + 1;
          if (x >= x1 && x < x1 + 160) 
                 c = c + 16;
         else if (x >= x1 + 160) 
                 c = c + 32;
 
         return c;

 Data compression:
  
    Compression is via a modified run length encoding (RLE) scheme,
 similar to DEGAS compressed and Tiny.  The data map is stored as a
 sequence of records.  Each record consists of a header byte followed by
 one or more data bytes.  The meaning of the header byte is as follows:
  
         For a given header byte, x:
  
            0 <= x <= 127   Use the next x + 1 bytes literally (no repetition)
         -128 <= x <=  -1   Use the next byte -x + 2 times

 The data appears in the following order:
  
         1. Picture data, bit plane 0, scan lines 1 - 199
         2. Picture data, bit plane 1, scan lines 1 - 199
         3. Picture data, bit plane 2, scan lines 1 - 199
         4. Picture data, bit plane 3, scan lines 1 - 199
  
 Decompression of data ends when 31840 data bytes have been used.
  
 Color map compression:
  
    Each 16-word palette is compressed separately.  There are three
 palettes for each scan line (597 total).  The color map is stored as a
 sequence of records.  Each record starts with a 1-word bit vector which
 specifies which of the 16 palette entries are included in the data
 following the bit vector (1 = included, 0 = not included).  If a palette
 entry is not included, it is assumed to be zero (black).  The least
 significant bit of the bit vector refers to palette entry zero, while the
 most significant bit refers to palette entry 15.  Bit 15 must be zero,
 since Spectrum 512 does not use palette entry 15.  Bit 0 should also be
 zero, since Spectrum 512 always makes the background color black.
    The words specifying the values for the palette entries indicated in
 the bit vector follow the bit vector itself, in order (0 - 15).
 
 NOTE:   Regarding Spectrum pictures, Shamus McBride reports the following:
 
         "... [The Picture Formats List] says bit 15 of the color map vector
         must be zero. I've encountered quite a few files where [bit 15] is 
         set (with no associated palette entry)..."
 
 
 <Spectrum 512 (Smooshed)>          *.SPS
 
    This format compresses Spectrum 512 pictures better than the standard
 method.  There are at least two programs that support this format, SPSLIDEX
 and ANISPEC, although the two seem to differ slightly in their interpretation
 of the format.
    One point of interest: Shamus McBride deciphered this format without an ST!

 Data compression:
 
    Compression is via a modified run length encoding (RLE) scheme,
 similar to that used in Spectrum Compressed (*.SPC) pictures.
 
 The data map is stored as a sequence of records.  Each record consists of a
 header byte followed by one or more data bytes.  The meaning of the header
 byte is as follows:
 
         For a given header byte, x (unsigned):
 
           0 <= x <= 127    Use the next byte x + 3 times
         128 <= x <= 255    Use the next x - 128 + 1 bytes literally
                            (no repetition)
 
 There are two kinds of *.SPS files.
 
 The data may appear in the same order as *.SPC files (SPSLIDEX format?):
 
         1. Picture data, bit plane 0, scan lines 1 - 199
         2. Picture data, bit plane 1, scan lines 1 - 199
         3. Picture data, bit plane 2, scan lines 1 - 199
         4. Picture data, bit plane 3, scan lines 1 - 199
 
 The second variant (ANISPEC format?) encodes the data as byte wide vertical
 strips:
 
         Picture data, bit plane 0, scan line   1, columns   0 -   7.
         Picture data, bit plane 0, scan line   2, columns   0 -   7.
         Picture data, bit plane 0, scan line   3, columns   0 -   7.
         . . .
         Picture data, bit plane 0, scan line 199, columns   0 -   7.
         Picture data, bit plane 0, scan line   1, columns   8 -  15.
         Picture data, bit plane 0, scan line   2, columns   8 -  15.
         . . .
         Picture data, bit plane 0, scan line 199, columns 312 - 319.
         Picture data, bit plane 1, scan line   1, columns   0 -   7.
         . . .
         Picture data, bit plane 3, scan line 198, columns 312 - 319
         Picture data, bit plane 3, scan line 199, columns 312 - 319.
 
 A for loop to process that data would look like
 
         for (plane = 0; plane < 4; plane++)
             for (x = 0; x < 320; x += 8)
                 for (y = 1; y < 200; y++)
                     for (x1 = 0; x1 < 8; x1++)
                         image[y, x + x1] = ...
 
 Color map compression:
 
    Color map compression is similar to *.SPC color map compression, but
 the map is compressed as a string of bits, rather than words.  There are
 597 records (one for each palette). Each record is composed of a 14-bit
 header followed by a number of 9-bit palette entries.  The 14-bit header
 specifies which palette entries follow (1 = included, 0 = not included).
 The most significant bit of the header refers to palette entry 1, while
 the least significant bit refers to palette 14.  Palette entries 0 and 15
 are forced to black (zero).  Each palette entry is encoded as "rrrgggbbb".
 
 The format of the palette is described above in the section on uncompressed
 Spectrum pictures (*.SPU).

    Frames are "delta-compressed," meaning that only the changes from one
 frame to the next are stored.  On the ST, .SEQ files are always full-screen
 low resolution animations, so the sequence resulting from expanding all the
 data will be n 320 by 200 pixel low resolution screens, where n is given in
 the .SEQ header.
   
    Since only the changes from frame to frame are stored, image data for a
  frame will rarely be 320x200 (except for the very first frame, which will 
 always be a full screen).  Instead what is stored is the smallest rectangular
 region on the screen that contains all the changes from the previous frame to
 the current frame.  The x offset and y offset in the frame header determine
 where the upper left corner of the "change box" lies, and the width and height
 specify the box's size.
 
    Additionally, each "change box" is stored in one of five ways.  For each
    of these, the screen is assumed to have the full-screen image from the last
    frame on it.
    
    o uncompressed copy:  The data for this frame is uncompressed image data,
      and is simply copied onto the screen at position (x, y) specified
      in the frame header.
 
    o uncompressed eor:  The data for this frame is exclusive or'ed with the
      screen at position (x, y).
 
    o compressed copy:  The data for this frame must be decompressed (see 
      below), and then copied onto the screen at position (x, y) specified
      in the frame header.
  
    o compressed eor:  The data for this frame must be decompressed (see 
      below), and then exclusive or'ed with the screen RAM at position (x, y).
  
    o null frame:  The width and/or height of this frame is 0, so this
      frame is the same as the previous frame.
    
    Of the 5 methods above, the one that results in the smallest amount
    of data being stored for a particular is used for that frame.
   
 Compression Scheme:
 
    Compression is similar to that employed by Tiny, but is not quite as
 space-efficient.
 
 Control word meanings:
 
         For a given control word, x:
 
         x < 0   Absolute value specifies the number of unique words to
                 take from the data section (from 1 to 32767).
         x > 0   Specifies the number of times to repeat the next word
                 taken from the data section (from 1 to 32767).
 
         Note that a control word of 0 is possible but meaningless.
 
 Format of expanded data:
 
    The expanded data is not simply screen memory bitmap data; instead the four
 bitplanes are separated, and the data within each bitplane is presented
 vertically instead of horizontally.  (This results in better compression.)
 
    To clarify, data for a full screen would appear in the following order:
    
    bitplane 0, word 0, scanline 0
    bitplane 0, word 0, scanline 1
    ...
    bitplane 0, word 0, scanline 199
    bitplane 0, word 1, scanline 0
    bitplane 0, word 1, scanline 1
    ...
    bitplane 0, word 1, scanline 199
    ... 
    bitplane 0, word 79, scanline 199
    bitplane 1, word 0, scanline 0
    ... 
    bitplane 3, word 79, scanline 199
 
 Note however, that the data does not usually refer to an entire screen, but
 rather to the smaller "change box," whose size is given in the frame header.

 NOTES:  If the image is a color image (planes > 1), the planes are stored
 separately starting with plane 0.  There is, however, no standard way of
 storing the color palette.  Some programs may save the palette in separate
 files, some may extend the header.  For this reason, you should never
 assume the header is 8 words long, always get the header length from the
 2nd word of the header.  Also, the line width in the 7th word is the number
 of pixels in a line.  Since the data is encoded in byte-wide packets, the
 actual unpacked line width is always a multiple of 8, and may be 1-7 pixels
 longer than the length specified in the header.
 
 For each byte x in the data section,
  
         x = 0           Pattern/scanline run.

                         If n > 0 then:
                                 Read a number of bytes equal to the "pattern
                                 length" word in the header.  Repeat this
                                 pattern n times.
  
                         If n = 0 then:
                                 Scanline run.  Data for the next scanline
                                 is to be used multiple times.  Read the
                                 following record:
  
                                 1 byte          flag byte [$FF]

                                                 next scanline data
  
                                 The data for the next scanline follows,
                                 compressed normally.
  
         x = 80 (hex)    Uncompressed bit string.  The next byte
                         determines the number of bytes to use
                         literally.  The literal data bytes follow.
  
         otherwise       Solid run.  The value of x determines
                         what to draw.  The high bit specifies whether
                         the pixels are set or cleared.  A 1 indicates
                         a byte-run using $FF, a 0 indicates a byte-run
                         using $00.  The low 7 bits, taken as an unsigned
                         quantity, specify the length of the run in bytes.

 ? bytes         data
 
    Compressed data may be either stand-alone or delta-compressed (relative
 to the base picture named in the header).  Delta compression involves
 storing only how the picture differs from the base picture (i.e., only
 portions of the screen that have changed are stored).  This is used to
 to encode animated sequences efficiently.
 
 Compressed data, stand-alone:
 
 For each byte x in the data section:
 
         x = escape byte         Read one more byte, n.  (n is unsigned).
 
                                 If n >= 2, use the next byte n times.
                                 If n = 1, keep reading bytes until a
                                 byte k not equal to 1 is encountered.
                                 Then read the next byte d.
                                 If the number of 1 bytes encountered is o,
                                 use d (256 * o + k) times.  I.e.,
 
                                 if (n == 1) {
                                         o = 0;
                                         while (n == 1) {
                                                o++;
                                                 n = next byte;

                                         k = n;

 1 long          length of chunk [3*n where n is the # colors]
 3n bytes        3 bytes per RGB color.  Each color value is a byte
                 and the actual color value is left-justified in the
                 byte such that the most significant bit of the value
                 is the MSB of the byte.  (ie. a color value of 15 ($0F)
                 is stored as $F0)  The bytes are stored in R,G,B order.
 
 4 bytes         "CRNG" (Color RaNGe chunk ID)

                 1 word = active [1] or inactive [0]
                 1 byte = left/lower color animation limit
                 1 byte = right/upper color animation limit
 
 4 bytes         "CAMG" (Commodore AMiGa viewport mode chunk ID)
 1 long          length of chunk [4]
 1 long          viewport mode bits (bit 11 = HAM, bit 3 = interlaced)
 
 4 bytes         "BODY" (BODY chunk ID)
 1 long          length of chunk [# bytes of image data that follow]
 ? bytes         actual image data
  
 NOTES: Some of these chunks may not be present in every IFF file, and may
 not be in this order.  You should always look for the ID bytes to find a
 certain chunk.  All chunk IDs are followed by a long value that tells the
 size of the chunk (note that "ILBM" is not a chunk ID).  This is the number of
 bytes that FOLLOW the 4 ID bytes and size longword.  The exception to this is
 the FORM chunk.  The size longword that follows the FORM ID is the size of the
 remainder of the file.  The FORM chunk must always be the first chunk in an
 IFF file.
 
 The R,G,B ranges of AMIGA and ST are different (AMIGA 0...15, ST 0...7),
 as is the maximum number of bitplanes (AMIGA: 5, ST: 4).
 
 Format of body data
  
 An expanded picture is simply a bitmap.  The packing method is PackBits
 (see below), and is identical to MacPaint and DEGAS Elite compressed.
  
 The (decompressed) body data appears in the following order:
  
         line 1 plane 0 ... line 1 plane 1 ... ... line 1 plane m
         [line 1 mask (if appropriate)]
         line 2 plane 0 ... line 2 plane 1 ... ... line 2 plane m
         [line 2 mask (if appropriate)]
         ...
         line x plane 0 ... line x plane 1 ... ... line x plane m
         [line x mask (if appropriate)]
  
 The FORM chunk identifies the type of data:
  
         "ILBM" = interleaved bit map
         "8SVX" = 8-bit sample voice
         "SMUS" = simple music score
         "FTXT" = formatted text (Amiga)
  
 
 <MacPaint>      *.MAC
  
 1 long          version number [0=ignore header, 2=header valid]
 38 * 8 bytes    8x8 brush/fill patterns.  Each byte is a pattern row,
                 and the bytes map the pattern rows top to bottom.  The
                 patterns are stored in the order they appear at the bottom
                 of the MacPaint screen top to bottom, left to right.
 204 bytes       unused
 -------------
 512 bytes       total for header
 
 < 51200 bytes   compressed bitmap data
 -------------
 < 51712 bytes   total
  
 NOTE:  The version number is actually a flag to MacPaint to indicate if
 the brush/fill patterns are present in the file.  If the version is 0,
 the default patterns are used.  Therefore you can simply save a MacPaint
 file by writing a blank header (512 $00 bytes), followed by the packed
 image data.
 
 Bitmap compression:
  
    The bitmap data is for a 576 pixel by 720 pixel monochrome image.
 The packing method is PackBits (see below).  There are 72 bytes per
 scan line.  Each bit represents one pixel; 0 = white, 1 = black.
  
 
 <RGB Intermediate Format>       *.RGB (low resolution only)
 
    This format was invented by Lars Michael to facilitate conversions between
 standard ST picture formats and higher resolution formats like GIF and IFF.
 It supports 12 bits of color resolution by keeping the red, green and blue
 components in separate bit planes.
 
 1 word          resolution (ignored)
 16 word         palette (ignored)
 16000 words     red plane (screen memory)> 1 word          resolution (ignored)
 16 word         palette (ignored)
 16000 words     green plane (screen memory)
 1 word          resolution (ignored)
 16 word         palette (ignored)
 16000 words     blue plane (screen memory)
 ------------
 96102 bytes     total
 
 The format was derived by concatenating three DEGAS .PI1 files together -- 
 one for each color gun.  The RGB value for a pixel is constructed by looking
 at the appropriate pixel in the red plane, green plane, and blue plane.  The
 bitplanes are in standard ST low resolution screen RAM format, but where pixel
 values in screen RAM refer to palette entries (0 through 15), pixel values
 here correspond to absolute R, G, and B values.  The red, green, and blue
 components for each pixel range from 0 to 15 (4 bits), yielding a total of
 12 bits of color information per pixel.  Not coincidentally, this is exactly
 the format of ST palette entries (although on ST's without the extended 
 palette only the lower 3 bits of each color component are used).
 
 You can view a single bit plane on a standard ST by splitting the .RGB file
 into its three DEGAS .PI1 components and setting the palette to successively
 brighter shades of gray.
 
 
 <ComputerEyes Raw Data Format>  *.CE1 (low resolution)
                                 *.CE2 (medium resolution)
                                 
 1 long          [$45594553 or "EYES"]
 1 word          resolution [0 = low res, 1 = medium res]
 8 words         ?
 If resolution = 0 {
 64000 bytes     red plane, 320 x 200, 1 pixel per byte
 64000 bytes     green plane, 320 x 200, 1 pixel per byte
 64000 bytes     blue plane, 320 x 200, 1 pixel per byte
 ------------
 192022 bytes    total
 } 
 else If resolution = 1 {
 128000 words    640 x 200, 1 pixel per word
 ------------
 256022 bytes    total
 }
 
    This is almost two formats in one:
    
         Low resolution:
 
            The planes are arranged vertically, instead of horizontally.
         The first byte is the red component of pixel (0,0), the second is (0,1)
         and the third (0,2).  The 201st corresponds to (1,0), etc.  The 64001st
         byte is the green component of (0,0).
            Only the low six bits of each byte are used.
 
         Medium resolution:
 
            The picture is arranged vertically, instead of horizontally.
         The first word is pixel (0,0), the second is (0,1), and the third
         (0,2).  The 200th is (1,0) etc.
            Each word is divided up into the RGB values for the corresponding
         pixel, as follows:
 
           Bit:  (MSB) 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 (LSB)
                       -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
                        0 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0 G4 G3 G2 G1 G0 R4 R3 R2 R1 R0
 
         Bit 15 is not used.
 
 
 <PackBits Compression Algorithm>
 
 The following packing algorithm originated on the Mac, was adopted by
 Electronic Arts/Commodore for use in the IFF standard, and then by Tom
 Hudson for use in DEGAS Elite.  The algorithm is currently used in
 MacPaint, IFF, and DEGAS Elite compressed file formats.  Each scan line
 is packed separately, and packing never extends beyond a scan line.
 
 For a given control byte 'n':
     0 <= n <= 127   : use the next n + 1 bytes literally (no repetition).
  -127 <= n <= -1    : use the next byte -n + 1 times.
          n = -128   : no operation, not used.
