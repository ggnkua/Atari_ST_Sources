  To access the library calls within your program , the library (see above)
  that you wish to use must first be declared at the very start of your
  program. This is done by including the following code at the start of your
  program. See TOOLBX_A.BAS for an example of this.

                           LIBRARY "????????","????????"

  Where ???????? is the name of the library i.e. "GEMDOS","BIOS" etc.

ת The NETWORLD library

  Please note that the library first needs to find out vital information from
  STiK in order to use the following commands. The command initstik FUNCTION
  returns the status of STiK.

ת FUNCTION initstik
  - Syntax:
    initstik

  - Effect:
    Sets up internal buffers between STiK and HBASIC so they can
    communicate.

  - Comments:
    THIS FUNCTION MUST BE CALLED. IF IT IS NOT, ALL OTHER ROUTINES IN THIS
    LIBRARY WILL CRASH THE MACHINE.

    If using the include file, there is no need to initialise the library
    yourself - the file does it for you.

    The function returns the status of how the communicate went on:

    Value    Meaning
      1      STiK OK - may use any commands in library
     -1      No cookie found
     -2      STiK found but inactive
     -3      STiK found but maybe corrupted

  - See Also:

  - Example:
    intstik


ת FUNCTION KRmalloc&()
  - Syntax:
    KRmalloc& (size&)

  - Effect:
    Allocates a block of memory from STiK's internal buffer.

  - Comments:
    Returns 0 if sufficient memory is not available.

    These memory functions are basically the code in K&R 1 pp 174 -
    177 but there are some minor differences.  morecore is *never*
    called. These functions use one block of memory that is Malloc'd
    when the ACC loads.  Also, the header size is 8 bytes since
    allocations greater than 2^16 are allowed, therefore memory is
    always allocated in multiples of 8 bytes.

    Some bits in the headers are checked during KRmalloc() and
    KRfree() to determine if memory corruption has occured.

  - See Also:
    KRfree, KRgetfree, KRrealloc

  - Example:
    mem&=KRmalloc& (10*1024) ' reserve 10K


ת KRfree() STATEMENT
  - Syntax:
    KRfree (mem&)

  - Effect:
    Free a block that was allocated by KRmalloc() or KRrealloc().

  - Comments:
    Currently, KRfree() does *not* check for a 0 address... (but this
    is such a good idea, that I will add the test)

  - See Also:
    KRmalloc, KRrealloc, KRgetfree

  - Example:
    mem&=KRmalloc&(10*1024) ' reserve 10K
    IF mem&<>0 THEN
    	KRfree (mem&)
    END IF


ת FUNCTION KRgetfree&()
  - Syntax:
    KRgetfree& (flag%)

  - Effect:
    Return the amount of free space left in STiK's internal buffer.

  - Comments:
    If flag is TRUE return the largest block, otherwise return total available
    space.

  - See Also:
    KRmalloc, KRfree, KRrealloc

  - Example:
    freespace&=KRgetfree&(0) ' total available space


ת FUNCTION KRrealloc&()
  - Syntax:
    KRrealloc& (blocksize&, newsize&)

  - Effect:
    Change the size of an allocated block.

  - Comments:
    If newsize is greater than oldsize, then copy the contents into the new
    block.

    If newsize=0 then free the block and return 0.

    If blocksize=0 then allocate a new block of newsize bytes, but zero the
    contents before returning.

  - See Also:
    KRmalloc, KRfree, KRgetfree

  - Example:
    mem&=KRmalloc&(20*1024) ' reserve 20K

    block&=KRrealloc& (20*1024,30*1024)

    ' transfers our 20K block to a 30K block and returns the address in block&


ת FUNCTION get_err_text&()
  - Syntax:
    get_err_text& (code%)

  - Effect:
    Returns a pointer to a description of an internal STiK error code.

  - Comments:
    The absolute value of code is used to look up the address on the start
    of the string (null terminated). If the code is out of range, a pointer
    to "" is returned.

    An easier way to get an internal STiK string is to use the include file's
    "gerrtxt$ ()" function

  - See Also:
    gerrtxt$ include function

  - Example:
    mem&=get_err_text& (1)

    a$=""
    DO
    	a=PEEK(mem&)
    	IF a<>0 THEN a$=a$+chr$(a)
    	mem&=mem&+1
    UNTIL a=0

    PRINT "Error message: "+a$


ת FUNCTION getvstr&()
  - Syntax:
    getvstr& (text&)

  - Effect:
    Returns a pointer to the value of a STiK config variable set in
    DEFAULT.CFG

  - Comments:
    The lookup is not case sensitive. The pointer is to the first non blank
    char after the '='.

    If a variable does not exist, a pointer to "0" is returned.

    If a variable has no '= value' "1" is returned (present= TRUE)

    If a variable has '=', but no value, then "0" is returned.

    An easier way to get a STiK string is to use the include file's "gvstr$
    ()" function.

  - See Also:
    gvstr$ () include function.

  - Example:
    text$="EMAIL"+chr$(0)
    email&=getvstr& (varptr(text$))

    ' email& contains the address of the beginning of a null terminated
      string relaying the email address of the user (if specified in the DAT
      file).


ת FUNCTION carrier_detect%
  - Syntax:
    carrier_detect%

  - Effect:
    Returns the status of connection.

  - Comments:
    If the config variable CDVALID is FALSE, then 0 (unknown) is returned.
    Otherwise, returns +1 for carrier, -1 for no carrier.

  - See Also:

  - Example:
    a%=carrier_detect%
    IF a%=-1 THEN
    	PRINT "NOT CONNECTED"
    ELSEIF a%=0 THEN
    	PRINT "UNABLE TO DETERMITE CONNECTION"
    ELSE
    	PRINT "CONNECTED"
    END IF


ת FUNCTION TCP_open%()
  - Syntax:
    TCP_open% (rhost&, rport%, tos%, obsize&)

  - Effect:
    Attempts to open a connection to rhost on rport.

  - Comments:
    tos is Type of Service.  I've never experimented with non zero values.

    obsize is the size of the output buffer to allocate.

    TCP_send() places data in this buffer.  Size dependant on requirements.
    Bigger is not necessarily better.  500 to 2000 should be OK.

    TCP_open() returns a connection handle (0..n) or a a negative
    error code.

    TCP_open() returns immediately, without waiting for the
    connection to establish.

    If rhost is 0, then the connection becomes a LISTEN socket, and waits for
    a connection request from a remote host.

    In this case, rport is the assignment of the local port and *not* the
    remote port...

    There is no provision for limiting the socket to listen for connection
    from a particular host or port. (ie: always INADDR_ANY)

    The port must be continually polled for input.  There is no other way to
    see if a connection has been made.

    Sending data to a connection in LISTEN mode is an error.

    If a remote host makes a connection, the connection will no longer be in
    LISTEN mode.  Requests from other hosts will be denied.  To circumvent
    this, do another TCP_open(0,...) when the first connection is activated.
    (or have several connections passive opened at the same time)

    NOTE To test the current status of the socket, simply call CNbyte_count().
     If E_LISTEN is returned, then the socket is still in TLISTEN state.  Any
    other function that has a connection handle as an argument will return the
    same error, except TCP_close().

    Author's apology...  It's very rough, but it's really only for my own
    testing.  If I don't have time to make something better soon, this method
    should at least be usable.  The reason that it is so rough is that I never
    intended having LISTEN sockets.  Hence, this is a hack.

    * an easier way to connect to a host is using the include file's
      "tcp_connect ()" function.

  - See Also:
    tcp_connect include file

  - Example:
    INPUT "Connect to: ",name$
    IF name$="" THEN STOP
    INPUT "On port: ",port

    cn=tcp_connect (name$,port,0,2000)
    IF cn<E_NORMAL THEN
  	PRINT "Connection failed!"
  	PRINT gerrtxt$(cn)
  	STOP
    END IF


ת FUNCTION TCP_close%()
  - Syntax:
    TCP_close% (cn%, timeout%)

  - Effect:
    Closes a connection.

  - Comments:
    cn is the connection handle.

    Returns 0 or a negative error code.

    timeout is the time in seconds to wait for the connection to close.
    TCP_close() must negotiate the close with the remote host, so it can take
    some time if the net is slow.  Pending data may need to be received and
    discarded before the connection closes cleanly.

    Note that TCP_close() *must* be called in order to free memory that has
    been allocated for the connection.

    A timeout of 0 is acceptable for immediate close.

    If the ESC key is pressed during the timeout period, TCP_close() returns
    immediately with a E_USERTIMEOUT error code.

  - See Also:
    TCP_send, TCP_open

  - Example:
    er%=TCP_close% (ch%,0)
    if er%<0 THEN gerrtxt$ (er%)


ת FUNCTION TCP_send%()
  - Syntax:
    TCP_send% (cn%, buf&, len%)

  - Effect:
    Send len bytes from buf on the connection cn.

  - Comments:
    Returns E_NORMAL for success, or an error code.

    Note that the error E_OBUFFULL is *not* a fatal error. If E_OBUFFULL is
    return, you should loop, for your own timeout period, waiting for the
    output buffer to clear.  If you have defined a buffer that is smaller than
    the block you are sending, it will never clear.

    buf& is actually an address to the start of the string.

    * an easier way of sending text is to use the include file's tcpsend()

  - See Also:
    TCP_open, TCP_close, TCPsend include file

  - Example:
    mess$="Hello world!!"
    x%=tcp_send% (cn%,VARPTR(mess$),LEN(mess$))


ת FUNCTION TCP_wait_state%()
  - Syntax:
    TCP_wait_state% (cn%, state%, timeout%)

  - Effect:
    Wait for timeout seconds for the connection cn, to reach a particular TCP
    state.

  - Comments:
    The primary use for this function is to wait for the TESTABLISH state
    after calling TCP_open() (though this is not really necessary).

    Returns E_NORMAL or an error code.

    If the ESC key is pressed while this function is waiting, it returns
    E_USERTIMEOUT.

  - See Also:

  - Example:
    er%=TCP_wait_state% (1,TFIN_WAIT2%,20)

    Waits for the the "await termination request" on channel 1, waiting for
    20 seconds.


ת FUNCTION TCP_ack_wait%()
  - Syntax:
    TCP_ack_wait% (cn%, timeout%)

  - Effect:
    Wait for all data in the output buffer to be acknowledged by the remote
    host.

  - Comments:
    Note that the timeout is in milliseconds.

    Returns E_NORMAL regardless of whether the timeout is reached or the
    output buffer clears.

    This is a kludge that you should probably never use...

  - See Also:
    TCP_wait_state

  - Example:
    er%=TCP_ack_wait% (1,10000)

    ' waits 10 seconds for channel 1 to be acknowledged


ת FUNCTION UDP_open%()
  - Syntax:
    UDP_open% (rhost&, rport%)

  - Effect:
    Open a UDP (datagram) connection with rhost on rport.

  - Comments:
    Returns connection handle or error code.

    Note that there is really no such thing as a UDP `connection'. The UDP
    functions provide a convenient and consistent method for communicating
    with remote hosts using UDP.

    UDP is used primarily by the domain name resolver.

  - See Also:
    UDP_close, UDP_send

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION UDP_close%()
  - Syntax:
    UDP_close% (cn%)

  - Effect:
    Close the UDP connection cn.

  - Comments:
    Frees the connection handle and any blocks pending in the
    input queue, returns immediately.

  - See Also:
    UDP_open, UDP_send

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION UDP_send%()
  - Syntax:
    UDP_send% (cn%, buf&, len%);

  - Effect:
    Sends len bytes from buf on the connection cn.

  - Comments:
    Returns E_NORMAL or an error code.

    NOTE that the the data will be sent as a single UDP packet, so you should
    make sure that it is appropriately sized for your MTU.

    * buf& is the address of the start of a string.

  - See Also:
    UDP_open, UDP_close

  - Example:
    mess$="Hello World!!"
    er%=UDP_send% (1,varptr(mess$),len(mess$))


ת FUNCTION CNkick%()
  - Syntax:
    CNkick% (cn%)

  - Effect:
    'kick' the connection cn.

  - Comments:
    If there is data waiting to be sent, then restart the retransmission
    sequence as though it is the first transmission. If there is no data
    waiting, send an ACK packet to the remote host to let them know we're
    still here.

    In theory this is a pointless function.  It is provided so that when the
    user starts bashing the keyboard during a long delay, the programmer
    arrange that something happens as a result.  This should save lots of
    valuable Atari hardware. :-))

    Since the retransmission algorithm uses exponential backoff, (ie: timeout
    doubles at every retransmission) the function is probably not entirely
    pointless.

    TCP specs state that excessive retransmissions should be avoided.

    Returns E_NORMAL or an error code if the connection is invalid.

  - See Also:

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION CNbyte_count%()
  - Syntax:
    CNbyte_count% (cn%)

  - Effect:
    Return the number of bytes waiting in the input queue for connection cn.

  - Comments:
    Returns positive number of bytes waiting or a negative error code.

  - See Also:
    CNget_char

  - Example:
    by%=CNbyte_count% (1)
    IF by%<E_NORMAL THEN
    	PRINT gerrtxt$ (by%)
    ENDIF

    FOR a%=1 to by%
    	byte%=CNget_char%
  	PRINT chr$(byte%)
    NEXT a%


ת FUNCTION CNget_char%()
  - Syntax:
    CNget_char% (cn%)

  - Effect:
    Return the next char from the input queue for cn, on a negative error code.

  - Comments:
    A return of E_NODATA is *not* fatal.

    Note that if you are using CNget_char() for data input then your loop
    *must* include CNbyte_count(), or the housekeep() function.

  - See Also:
    CNbyte_count(), housekeep()

  - Example:
    See CNbyte_count() example


ת FUNCTION CNget_NDB&()
  - Syntax:
    CNget_NDB& (cn%)

  - Effect:
    Return a pointer to the next block on the input queue for cn, or 0 if
    there are no packets queued.

  - Comments:
    This is potentially the most efficient way of reading the input queue,
    because the NDB contains a point to the actual packet that was read in
    initially.  No data has been copied up to this point.

    There is no way defined for CNget_NDB() to return any other connection
    error status.

    The NDB structure is defined in TRANSPRT.H

    Since CNget_NDB() unlinks the packet from the input queue, you must use
    KRfree() to free the packet and the NDB structure as well.

  - See Also:

  - Example:
    addr&=CNget_NDB& (cn%)

    if addr&<>0 then process_block(addr&)


ת FUNCTION CNget_block%()
  - Syntax:
    CNget_block% (cn%, blk&, len%)

  - Effect:
    Fills a block starting at blk with len bytes from cn.

  - Comments:
    If the input queue has less than len bytes, then no data will be
    transferred.

    Returns the number of bytes you requested, or an error code.
    E_NODATA is *not* a fatal error.

  - See Also:

  - Example:


ת housekeep STATEMENT
  - Syntax:
    housekeep

  - Effect:
    Performs internal housekeeping duties.

  - Comments:
    You don't really need to call this function, but an explanation is
    necessary.  housekeep() is called internally by several of the other
    functions listed here.  In particular, all of the CN input functions call
    housekeep() *except* CNget_char(). (otherwise a whole packet could be
    received every time CNget_char() is called!)

    STiK does not do any background or interrupt processing. Everything is
    acheived by polling.  housekeep() is the central function of STiK that
    does this polling.  It calls these functions:-

    do_resolve()        Resolver processing, including reading packets
    slip_in()           Reading the serial port
    slip_out()          Writing to the serial port
    tcp_timer()         TCP retransmissions
    frag_ttl_check()    Check time to live in fragment reassembly queue

    Housekeep is now driven by the system_timer interupt.  So it runs up to a
    maximum of 50/sec.  The event_multi in the .ACC no longer calls
    housekeep().  This avoids several problems with Magic.

    NOTE that the efficiency of STiK relates to this function, but I have to
    admit that housekeep() has not been carefully thought out. However, if the
    functions called by housekeep() have no work to do, they return quickly.
    All the same, they can each be called many times each second.

  - See Also:

  - Example:
    housekeep


ת FUNCTION resolve%()
  - Syntax:
    resolve% (dn&, rdn&, alist&, lsize%)

  - Effect:
    Resolve a domain name into one or more IP addresses.

  - Comments:
    dn is the domain name.

    rdn is the real domain name, which is returned if dn is an alias (CNAME).
    alist is a pointer to an array where the IP address(s) are returned.
    lsize is the size of that array.

    If the information is in local cache, then resolve will return it
    immediately, otherwise an algorithm for query of nameservers is initiated.
     This can take some time, however, the resolver has an internal limit on
    the amout of work it will do in attempting to resove a hostname.  (Hence
    the error code `work limit reached')

    If rdn=0 then no value is assigned to it. Otherwise, a pointer to the
    domain name associated with the addresses is assigned to *rdn, even if it
    is the same as that requested.

    This pointer must be freed using KRfree().

    If you pass a dotted decimal ip address to resolve, and request the rdn,
    you will just get the dotted decimal ip back.  This is a kludge, but
    better than the old manner of just crashing.

    resolve() returns the number of addresses copied to alist, or a negative
    error code.

    In retrospect, it might not have been all that smart of me to write my own
    DNS resolver, but it is at least educational :-)) All the same, it is
    *not* yet finished.  There are some bugs in the code at present, and also
    inefficiency in my algorithm.

    NOTE that STiK.ACC will save the dns cache to domain.txt every five
    minutes if AES is active and STiK is enabled.

    * An easier way of connected to a host is by using the include file's
      "tcp_connect ()" function.

ת ser_disable STATEMENT
  - Syntax:
    ser_disable

  - Effect:
    This function disables the serial port prior to disk I/O

  - Comments:
    It should only be necessary for combinations of baud rate/ cpu speed that
    do not allow DMA and serial I/O to work together. Internally, it calls Jan
    Kriesten's DEVICE.LIB function StopReceiver().  This, in turn, calls an
    IOCTL function that might only work with HSMODEM loaded.  I'm not sure.

    In the current version of STiK this (and ser_enable) return without doing
    anything.  I'm waiting for bug reports before I decide what to do with it.

    NOTE that if the port is disabled (in later STiK versions) it *must* be
    reenabled immediately after the disk I/O, or that is the end of the TCP
    session :-))

ת FUNCTION Set_flag%()
  - Syntax:
    set_flag% (flag%)

  - Effect:
    This calls an assembler routine that sets one of 64 possible flags using
    TAS.  The idea is that with proper flag setting STiK should function
    properly in a pre-emptive multitasking environment.  They could also be
    used for locking of other well defined processes, such as mailers etc.

  - Comments:
    Currently only the first two of these flags is used, for housekeep() and
    do_resolve() which are not re-entrant.

    set_flag() returns TRUE if the flag was already set (ie: Someone else owns
    the lock) or FALSE if the flag was clear, and set_flag() changed it
    successfully.  (ie: the lock is ours). (in other words, set_flag() returns
    the value the flag had before this call)

    NOTE that anyone wishing to define a new lock should coordinate with the
    author of the internet layer.

  - See Also:
    clear_flag

  - Example:


ת clear_flag() STATEMENT
  - Syntax:
    clear_flag (flag%)

  - Effects:
    Clears a flag regardless of it's current status.

  - Comments:
    Returns nothing.

  - See Also:
    set_flag

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION CNgetinfo&()
  - Syntax:
    CNgetinfo& (cn%)

  - Effect:
    Returns a pointer to a CIB structure that has information about the
    connection associated with the handle 'cn'.

  - Comments:
    This includes protocol, remote host, remote port, and the local port.  The
    address of the local host can be found with stik_cfg->client_ip

    The pointer is to a live part of the connection information, so don't
    change anything unless you know what you're doing.

    The definition of a CIB can be found in the 'transprt.bh' file.

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION on_port%()
  - Syntax:
    on_port% (port&)

  - Effect:
    Returns true if port was succesfully opened

  - Comments:
    This turns a physical port on.  It is mainly for use by a Dialer.

    port is the name from the DEV_LIST structure.

    If port is already open this call will return TRUE
    If port doesn't exist on machine this will return False

  - See Also:

  - Example:


ת off_port() STATEMENT
  - Syntax:
    offport (port&)

  - Effect:
    Turns a physical port off.

  - Comments:
    port is the name from the DEV_LIST structure, mainly for use with a Dialer.

    experimentation with this function on an active port will probably kill
    the connection.  Play at your own risk!

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION setvstr%()
  - Syntax:
    setvstr% (vs&, value&)

  - Effect:
    Sets a value in the cfg->cv array.

  - Comments:
    If the value is already present it changes it.
    - returns TRUE if variable was changed/set
    - returns FALSE if array is already full and the variable doesn't exist

  - See Also:
    getvstr

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION query_port%()
  - Syntax:
    query_port% (port&)

  - Effect:
    Checks if a given port is active.

  - Comments:
    Returns TRUE if port is active
    Returns FALSE if port is inactive

  - See Also:
    on_port, off_port

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION g_resolve%()
  - Syntax:
    g_resolve% (dn&, rdn&, alist&, lsize%)

  - Comments:
    The only difference between this and resolve is that the code uses an
    evnt_multi.  So it should be non blocking.  But it can only be used from
    GEM applications.

  - See Also:
    resolve

  - Example:


ת FUNCTION g_TCP_wait_state%()
  - Syntax:
    g_TCP_wait_state% (cn%, state%, timeout%)

  - Comments:
    This is the GEM version of TCP_wait_state, in all other respects
    it functions the same.  May only be called from a GEM application.

  - See Also:
    TCP_wait_state
