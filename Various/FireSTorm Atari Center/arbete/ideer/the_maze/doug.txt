Well! it is something like doom/Wolf1 but not completely!
first: I'm only going to use a square system to draw the maps! (90 degres 
walls) square is not quite right! cube would be more truthfull!

I hope that this will be confidential:

You see! a couple of days ago I got a very good idea for new jaguar game!
And I'm thinking of using the "deal" that daryl Still sent out in N.St.Games a 
while ago.

The simple idea is that you arre flying some kind of craft in a 3D labyrint (2D 
maze in 3D perspectiv, but a 3D map in 3d perspective)
Your object is to shoot down every other computer/human players in the maze!

You might call our Game Midimaze 2000   :)

Well I havn't tried anything out yet! and I probebly will try it out in C first 
since in testing I don't have to do everything fast and C will produce result 
quicker, atleast for me! after that I could try in Asm! and IF we get to make 
it as a Jaguar game It will Definitive be Asm!!!!

Yup, I think this is how Wolfenstein and Alien vs Predator work. They both have

Yes, this is ray-casting - but you will not be able to perform this many 
calculations in realtime every frame. You would need to cast a virtual ray for 
every pixel on the screen and that's a lot of arithmetic to be doing during 
every update.

Wow! You are brave.

This constitutes raytracing the whole screen and the Jaguar, although fast, is 
not fast enough for this process. The Jaguar's advantage over other machines is 
the ability to transfer 'runs' or 'strips' of textures or shading in hardware 
without clogging up the RISC chips. If you want speed, you will have to take 
advantage of this feature.

You have 5 options.... (none of them are fantastic)

1. Bilinear texturemapping (polygon -> polygon)  (easy & crap)
2. Subdivided bilinear texturemapping            (not too bad)
3. FDTM (free-directional texturemapping)        (ultraslow, but cool)
4. Skewed affine texturemapping                  (nightmare scenario)
5. Limit your rotation to left & right.          (very good advice)

Bilinear texturemapping is the easiest of the lot. It just maps a polygon 
directly onto another polygon. It's very fast and takes advantage of hardware 
capabilities. Unfortunately you get optical illusions of 'bending' inside the 
texture due to the lack of true perspective caused by the 'squash to fit' 
algorithm.

Subdivided bilinear texturemapping is a good bet, since you use the above 
algorithm but you divide each wall into 4, 9 or 16 smaller polygons which do 
not distort badly since they are not 'deep' enough to be affected by the 
perspective. Decoding the map could become a bit more involved but it works 
quite well. It's a good idea to split the walls based on their size or distance 
so you don't end up with billions of tiny polygons where you don't need them. 
This is called adaptive subdivision (you could hardwire the subdivision levels 
into the map or have several pre-devided wall templates you can use instead. 
All the walls are the same shape, so it should be ok!)

Proper FDTM is not a good option - you need either lots of arithmetic 
(multiplies, and even divides if you don't fudge it!) on every pixel which will 
loose you any hardware advantages, or alternatively you could reduce this to 2 
or 3 'add's per pixel. Unfortunately, to calculate the values for these 'add's 
you need to do some Calculus and some simultaneous equations. You do NOT want 
to have to do this unless you are extremely determined - and this is just the 
screen routs. You still have the rest of the game to write and it gets harder. 
The main advantage is that it looks absolutely fantastic. No perspective errors 
in sight.

Skewed affine texturemapping is a bodge and does not work all that well. Stay 
away from it or you will end up begging somebody yo shoot you in the head just 
to put you out of your misery. You do some suspect maths to work out the 
'planar vector' of the polygon and use this along with a curve-table (worked 
out earlier) to draw a 'skewed' version of the polygon. This is not a good 
description but you are not missing much.

I would strongly advise you to reconsider dumping the full-rotation idea and 
limit yourself to left/right (Y-axis) rotation. There are a lot of advantages...

1.  Fast, accurate texturemapping without fudges.

2.  Map construction is very easy in 2D.

3.  Collision detection is limited to 2D-line checking.

4.  You can still look up/down at 30' by skewing the vertical texture segments 
used in the walls. It works quite well.

5.  3D Flight is a total nightmare. If this is your first attempt at a game, or 
even just your first 3D game then stay completely away from it. The phrases 
'gimbal-lock' and 'jacobian quaternion' might sound strange just now but they 
start to become your own personal hell when you need to use them for full 3D 
rotation vectors for enemy ships. And I'm not talking about a bunch of spinning 
cubes here. COMPLETE AND TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!

If you want to keep the chances of completing your game quite high, then stick 
to something fairly simple. You will run into enough problems with map-editors 
and 3D texture painters long before you need to add to them with things like 
FDTM!

Think absolutely everything through before you begin. There are traps at EVERY 
corner - but you can beat them all eventually if you keep your head clear. It 
helps to talk things through with a colleague as it shows up the weaknesses of 
a system very quickly.

I'm glad of this. It's very sensible to work out your algorithms in C or Pascal 
or even Basic (both are great for testing maths) before writing the code. 
Although Jens Bauer might argue with me here!

Thank You! BTW There is a new game out there for the Falcon! its called Towers 
II You might have heard of it? It's Supposed to be launched Yesterday! and 
Hopefully It will be up on some FTP-sites soon!

Ofcourse, only when you have free time! (You have to work on your Jaguar-game 
also. But I do Think that you spend to much time on Reading :) You should go 
back and work on the Jaguar :)

Ofcourse! But this offer was only sent by Darryl! He didn't make it! it was an 
other guy at Atari Europe who wrote it! I think his name was Alistair Bodin.
Annyway, Even if we don't get to do this! we would like that someone else did 
it. Coz We think that it would be a Very good type of game!

 > Excellent.

We Thought That too :) Multiplayer Game (16 Jaguars connected?) :)
You play against your freinds or with them!

Weel on a 320*200 display it will only be 64000 rays to be cast :)
B ut no! it will take to much time so this has been discarded!
I Only wanted to know If I got the rigth idea or not!

OK! Lets hear them :)

I Hope That You will Tell me what all this is? :)

This is the Way 3DO is using, or? Especially in the First W3D type of game that 
came out (nightmare... Something)
This is a 2D mapping right?

 > Subdivided bilinear texturemapping is a good bet, since you use the above

OK! I think that I understand the way of doing things here
It is almost Exactly the same as #1 but we use smaller and more Textures!

 > Proper FDTM is not a good option - you need either lots of arithmetic

:) Even if it will look very good it will take to much time! and unfourtunally 
we are not very good at this moment making routines faster and faster!
So the gameplay will probebly be too slow with this! :)

 > Skewed affine texturemapping is a bodge and does not work all that well.

This must be something like Morphing then? or?

But i think there is One Big Disadvantage! We Think That Gameplay will Be 
Affected by This! And Gameplay is the most important part!
We think thata "fully" 3D map would add much to the gameplay, unfourtunaly
if it gets to hard we will settle for a 2D map! but it will affect Gameplay 
more than we would like!

 > 1.  Fast, accurate texturemapping without fudges.

It Is Easier! But When My Mapmaking Algoritms works! The Only difference will 
be that a 2D Version will be faster! (A Map-making Algorithm using 2D maps is 
Already done!)

 > 3.  Collision detection is limited to 2D-line checking.

Thats right! But If We use a "craft" that have 6 Points of external "walls" And 
Keep the Craft Inside That I think that the Crash with Walls will stil be easy! 
The only big problem is crashes with other crafts!

That Way We Can still fly ion the whole corridore!   +-----+

hehe! Well We thought of making the enemies fully texturemapped also! but We 
are Not going to do that! We Will Settle For only Polygon and Shaded ships!
But it still is much work!
I did A while ago make some 3D wireframes routines so that I could rotate any 
object that I drawed! But the code was written in GFA and I did use the full 
COS/SIN algorithms and not the quick ones! :)

Well, we will only have a few predefined 3Dmaps! the rest of them is going to 
be calculated by the Jaguar! It will take a little (Nice name) longer for the 
player to actually start the game but we can probebly calculate a new maze when 
the player choose in the options! or something like that! I already have 
routines for making maps in 2D and they will not be too hard to convert to 3D
For Textures we will Probebly use Spooky2 on the Falcon (spooky is really a 
Sprite editor in "True Colour" But it have some Nice funktions)
Hopefully we will be able to run the game (if we ever get the chance to make 
it) in 65536 colours, We Don't think that More Colours will add to the Gameplay 
that Much! We might even get down to 256 Colours! but if We do that we will 
spend more time calculating shadows and that type of things, so we don't think 
that there will be extra time won by doing so.

 > These things are better described with a pen and paper.

Yes! Definitly!!!! Unfourtunally Pen And Paper take too long! (Thats becouse of 
Snails)

We Are thinking! :) At First I wanted to Make it Full 3D even the MAP (like 
Heretic?) But We Quickly Discarded That Idea!
After That Some Ideas on how the Map would work were Discarded!
Then  we discarded Textures on the enemy ships! since if we did use that we 
would use more time Calculating the ships since less cheating can be done on it.
So The Game is getting smaller the more We Speak! :( But hte most important is 
that what we think of the gameplay it will not change that much!

Yeah! Jens! But he is some sort of a geanius (Much like yourself) But When he 
work out how to do a thing in his head he works with ASM directly! :)
And Thats to much for me! :(
