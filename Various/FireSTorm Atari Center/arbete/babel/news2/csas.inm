n computers.
I'm very cynical and just because it's *fab, groovy and new* doesn't make it 
*good*. I like to print off a boring old .TXT with minimal fuss and read it 
at my leasure wherever I like. I quite often take them into work and use the 
office laser. Well I don't know (and don't want to know) of a PC program to 
convert them! It's all down to laziness really (as someone else said in this 
thread). I *don't want* .HYP documentation. I *like* .TXT docs.

Other people have said it's 'easy to convert 'em to .TXT'. Is it?
Can't say I've done it. Then again, why should I have to?
I also get fed up with some .HYP's that seem to tell me to 'try the latest 
ST-Guide'. Pisses me off. AFAIK I *do* use the latest. ST-Guide *isn't* 
supported anymore. Or is it? I have the latest *English* version. 
*Interactive* is a waste of time IMHO. They are about 18 months out of date.
Joe Conner, where are you???? I tried to get a English version of Bubble-Gem 
out of Thomas Much, to be told 'try Interactive'. Yeah right :((((

If you need online help, fine. Personally for Atari software I think it's 
over rated. I know my way around Atari's and haven't yet wished for online 
help. Windows etc. is a different story ;-)

>Anyway. That's one of the best thing we have imo for atari. Besides,

Totally *disagree*. If that's 'one of the best things' on the Atari 
platform, then it's very dire indeed. Hypertext help is a nicety, it's by no 
means *important*!! Decent functioning software is *what's important*, not 
flashy *help files*. :((

>MAC also can read directly HYP files directly, and I heard Amiga,
>(altough Amiga reader can't read directly the HYP file, need to
>recompile it from the STG file). 

Whoopy! I sold my Amiga 5 years ago, and have never had acess to a Mac.
So this is *hardly* a selling point :(

>Anyway. Much more convienient than TXT files in any ways.

Nope. Not at all. I can take my .TXT file in to work and print it on the 
laser. Then I can read it whenever I like.

>Btw where are you going in FLorida? where at precisely?

If I go, it will be Lakeland. Between Orlando and Tampa. It actually got a 
mention in the X-Files a few weeks ago, which surprised me.
I worked there for 5 months about 3 years ago. This time it will be on a 
contract basis for a year.

oh, thats new to me. i never had this problems with my IDE-drive(s).
and i hope i won´t get such problems in the future !!!!
another miracle: my 2xSCSI-CD-ROM never seemed to have problems... don´t

hm, i asked robert schaffner about the nemesis card yet.
he told me it is only available at TITAN in the uk. 
can you tell me an email adress to contact them ? that would be nice !
please, no www-pages, ´cause i don´t have a www-account!  :-(

i think spending money on a nemesis won´t be wrong, if it helps solving
my falcons´ SCSI-problems....  !! and speed is always welcome ...

I am in agreement with you Gary.  I find them (HYP files) kind of
annoying.  Sometimes it's useful, but I prefer a text file.  And like you
said, if you're going to supply the HYP file, then at least include the
TXT file as well.

Just curious...

I'm about to (finally) get MagiC 5 for my Falcon, and I currently use ICD
Pro HD software (version 6.5.5).  Anyway, I know MagiC will work with the
ICD driver, but what _won't_ I be able to do with it?  I have heard that
certain background "activities" are only possible with HD Driver.  But is
this the only thing that ICD can't do?

Also, if I decide to switch to HD Driver, what is the latest ENGLISH
version, and do I have to reformat/repartition the drive in order to get
the most out of HD Driver?

That's interesting.  It must be my ISP that sets the limit.

A while back, someone here (I forget who) was looking for some Atari BBS
software.  Well, the best Atari BBS software I ever saw was made by a guy
named Brian Hauer.  He used to run a couple of Atari BBSes in Southern
California a few years ago.  He was also co-author (and friend of) Aaron
Hopkins of Freeze Dried Terminal fame.  Anyway, he's always been an
excellent ST programmer, and he wrote this BBS software a while back, and
used to use it on his system.  It's called Foresight, and it can be found
(although I'm not 100% sure it's the latest version as I haven't spoken
to Brian in a while) on the ftp site below:

wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/atari/umich.edu/Telecomm/Foresight

I believe the file is called "FS_WB2.ZIP"

Hope this helps whoever it was that was looking for Atari BBS software!

Someone here replied to my question about additional "X-" information in
the article headers.  They said that Okami made it possible.

Well, I use NEWSie, is there a way to do?

And does anybody happen to know a way to convert Signum FONTS into some
portable format? Bitmaps? If so - how? On Atari or on PC? Under emulation?
(BTW till now I haven't been able to run Signum on my actual STE - TOS
versions conflict, I believe - under PacifiST an image of the same Signum
diskette works fine, as well as with TosBox). Maybe using Tex? Which
program? Ghostscript? (And another question - a little digression, O.K. I
know this is not the very best group for it, I apologize- is the Ghostscript
for Atari the same one as for Windows95? That is, if I install it in
Pacifist's mounted disk' directory, would I be able to run the same GS in
common PC way too?) If possible... Thanks.

Parcp's lead is very easily made, the instructions are there in the archive.

I bought a lead from a PC Fair and opened the shell of one of the connectors 
to make the necessary crossovers. Make sure you get a lead with plugs at each 
end - and that the shells aren't moulded! :-))

Speak to 'ya later!

Classic question number 2: Which CAB.OVL are you using ?

It's always recommended to use the latest one from the author's homepage.
The URL is in the Quick FAQ.

Just swap the drive mechanisms. You'll need to set a jumper to change the ID
number, but other than that, it's a simple plug'n'play job.

The English and German binaries are always identical, i. e. versions and
features don't differ. This is because all programs are bilingual. They
use the German or English language, depending on the language TOS
indicates. The latest version is 7.54.
If your drive doesn't have more than 4 partitions repartitioning is not
necessary. Otherwise it depends on how you partitioned your drive.
Especially old versions of the ICD software didn't create the format
documented by Atari for more than 4 partitions. If this is the case
ICD2AHDI (included in the HDDRIVER distribution) will change the format
with losing data.
Have a look at the demo version of HDDRIVER for more information:

Hmmmm... is this such a good idea, to ignore the BUBBLEGEM_ACK that is?
As it's your app which allocate memory for the string sent to BubbleGEM
you can free or change the string whenever you want, BubbleGEM will
read just junk. You are only sending a pointer to the string so you
realy need to wait for BUBBLEGEM_ACK before you do anything with the 
string to be on the safe side.

Ease 4 supports dialogs to the mouse position, but that's not what I 
meant. What I meant was how does one make the 'system' (MagiC's AES) tell 
applications to have dialogs follow the mouse instead of centered? 
Geneva's AES handles this rather well... I just thought it would be 
possible under MagiC. Maybe the idea is that applications themselves 
should decide whether there's a need for that (like Ease). But a large 
monitor (like the TTM195) dictates the use of something to have dialogs 
near the mouse.

Yes,- that was the name I forgot. He,- Shiraz Shivji, also designed the C=64
when he was with Comodore. He was one of the many C. employes Tramiel took with
him to Atari.

There is no similaries between the two machines, exept for the man who 
made the design.

I bet you have not got CAB.OVL in /MODULES/. Get yourself a copy from
Dan Ackerman's page. It is this .OVL which actually does the Internet

I'd just like to publicly say a big *thanks* for putting my suggestion or 
saving the message-id of articles in so quickly. :-))

I've just tested it by assigning Alt G to the command save-mid and it works 
a treat. Dead easy to now download whole articles where you have previously 
just retrieved the header, using NEWSwatch and NOS's GET file format.

For people out there who use NEWSwatch with Okami, then get hold of the 
latest beta135.zip from Jos's web site, and see what I mean :-)

If the TIFFs are in CCITT-compressed format, like I think most faxes are, 
one is going to have trouble viewing them with a graphics program. At 
least this is my experience. That particular flavour of TIFF seems to be 
the domain of fax programs.

That makes sense about keeping all the configuration files in one 
directory. One thing, though... does the second line have to be defined, 
too (i.e. do they work hand-in-hand)?

Hi,

That will be difficult. Don't know if you'll find an ethnernet card for
your STE. Does it have a VME bus? If so you can buy a Riebl Card.
Thought Best Electronics still had some. There are STing drivers
available for this card.
Another solution is connecting your STE to a PC via a parallel or serial
cable and using Ghostlink to do the transfert. Also thought that it
should be possible with STing.
I also read on maus.sys.atari.hardware that next company developped an
ethernet interface. Haven't checked it out yet, maybe you can contact
them once.

Guess you'll find something there that may be interesting.

1. I never write "fuck", I only say it. :)
2. If you want to read a manual in ST-Guide format from beginning to 
end you can a) use the page arrows in the ST-Guide menu to jump from 
page to page, and b) decompile it into a txt file and read that from 
beginning to end.

Get lost!!! You know this sort of thing is illegal (I guess that's the 
reason you're not even giving up your real name). It also kills the 
software industry for our platform.
Pay for the software you want instead of stealing.

I believe they were built by a company called IB Computers formerly
located in Washington State.  They sold them to people who needed
access to the 5 1/4 inch format to read data off IBM Compatible 360K
drive disks.    Not sure how any sold, but you see them selling cheap
from time to time.

??? STiNG runs with MagiC PC as nearly every other program I have. I 
don't know Devpac but Pure Assembler runs fine. There's a (old) demo 
version of MagiC PC, try it out (http://ash.sww.net).

I would think that the Alphas only did the rendering, so it shouldn't be to hard to
port a
renderer to it. The editing probably took place one something else.

I think you are wrong. NVDI 5 works with the complete Stylus range of
inkjet printers, also those Windows printers.

For starters it would be a good idea to say where in the world you are 
located.
I'm sure someone here would be interested, but depending on where you 
are the cost of sending it could be quite a lot (or very little if 
they're close by).

Something interesting happened....
Like I've already said I haven't been able to FTP successfully into my 
provider's server using my account name, but then I got the idea to try 
the alternative server (which I believe mirrors my files, or is directly 
connected to the same disks or something).
Well, this worked!!!! I got a proper file-listing using "aFTP", so 
apparently it has something to do with the server at the other end.
Any ideas what could be causing this?

I haven't tried to FTP with "Newsie" yet, but I suspect this will give 
me a positive result as well since "aFTP" worked and both programs 
wouldn't work properly with the other server.


By the way, anyone know an address to a suitable time-server I can use 
with the "daytime.cpx"? I set the following up in STiNG's "default.cfg" 
file:

TIME_SERVER = time.demon.co.uk 
# The line above specifies the server to be contacted 
TIME_ZONE   = +60 
# The line above means Sweden is 60 minutes ahead of GMT normally 
TIME_SUMMER = 03.30.10.26 
# And the one above here means we add 1 hour during March 30 through Oct 25 

But it didn't work. I took the above from the "STiNG time services" 
package by Ronald Andersson, but never got it to work, whichever "*.app" 
in the package I ran I got no results, but the above should work for the 
CPX module as well, right?

Okay, this, and the difference between Rejecting and Killing are
understood.

However, a lot of spammers are using mass emailers that cobble up a
fake address in either the From: or To: fields (or both) that is
different every time they send out the message.  For instance I get a
lot of spam from someone at earthlink.com, but the user id portion of
the addresses is usually a number, like 90645@earthlink.com.  The next
time it'll be 80636@earthlink.com, and so on.

Most of the addresses in my Kill File have only occured once, and as
such are useless for killing any spam that arrives later.

Would it be possible to modify the Kill function so that I could enter
*@earthlink.com, so that ANY emails from this domain would be nuked?
(I can always UNDO the deed if I decide I would like to receive it.)

Popwatch is a very useful item for screening mails, and I have used it
from its first release.  But the presence of the Kill function is so
tantalizing, it would be nice if it were to be expanded so as to short
circuit those devilishly clever spammers.

Parcp's lead is very easily made, the instructions are there in the archive.

I bought a lead from a PC Fair and opened the shell of one of the connectors 
to make the necessary crossovers. Make sure you get a lead with plugs at each 
end - and that the shells aren't moulded! :-))

Speak to 'ya later!

You obviously have not heard of SEMPER, i'm running SEMPER on my MegaSTE on

There is an alternative in the form of OCTOPUS, this allows you to run a

Hello!

I am in the process of learning the M6809, which some instructions
were carried over to the 68000. 

SInce I also have a 1040STF w/30 MB HD, I would like to start to
program the 1040STF. I have the Mark Williams C, and the Gem
Programmer's Reference. But, I would like some more.

UNFORTUANETLY, it seems that I got robbed with an internet deal to buy
some 27 ST mags. (I was hoping that they might contain some
programming info) :(

Anyone have the needed info? Articles, newletters? SOurce code?
Examples?  I would be willing to pay shipping.

US users please.

Regards,

Jim

Hi!
 
  Some years ago did Steinberg produce a mutitasking OS of their own for
the Atari TOS computers, I think it was named MROS, what happened to that?
Was it any good? And what machines did it run on (ST/STE/MSTE/TT) ?

Howdy.

  I once had a Nakasha (I think they where named so) mouse for my ST, I
sold it along with a Mega4 some 7-8 years ago, It was the best one I ever
had, is it possible to get hold of them nowadays? Any other _good_ quality
mouse would also work fine. 

I've downloaded a driver that allows me to use a PC mouse, but as it locks
up my com-port I don't really fancy it.

Hints anyone?

Hey Scott,

the best (if you have access to the Net already) is go to
http://www.flinny.demon.co.uk/download.html
and fetch what you need: CAB 1.5, Sting, CAB-OVL, TelVT102 (telnet), 
AtariIRC (IRC), Finger, and HSMODA7.

You need that one, since even with TOS 4.x (Falcon TOS) Atari never bothered 
to get the ports done right. There's extensive docs, and for every machine 
there's patches to get the ports at least do what they're supposed to do.
So HSModa is a set of prgs, ttps, docs etc. to fix up your serial ports.

CAB 1.5 was "free", the later updates are commercial packages.

Newsie (now at 0.90) can be fetched from 
www.primenet.com/~rojewski/newsie.html

There were some problems with the prg from a belgian ftp site, but this URL 
is perfect. (Hey, I registered in about 1 hour, tks John!)

Hi Kent,

if you want MT on your Atari, you need Geneva, MagiC, N.AES/MINT or 
something else. MROS was only to get Cubase up and running from TOS.

Don't expect to get a general MT environment on Atari from it :-(
It was good enough to get Cubase running though :-)

Try to find STemulator -- somewhere on www.atari.de, or
www.atari.dee/falkeverlag. It costs less that 100 DM, what is about 60 $ or
less. There you can find a demo version. 
I use it in P200, 32 MB, and it is good. Of course, it is not so fast as
PC, but it is faster than a hardware Atari... 
(I work with Calamus by PaCifiST, Signum!2 by STemulator, etc.)

I keep getting this. It appears as though the escape key, along with other
keys at times, are being pressed. The way I've found to get round this is
to open an alert/dialogue box and press return to close it. This has worked
every time so far.

Yes it is. Under the menu 'Messages', click on 'Add to kill file', then
enter 'earthlink.com' into 'From:'. Finally click add or press return and
all incoming mail from earthlink is killed. This can be repeated for any
domain as required.

 Hi,

 I'm designing a low-cost solution to add an Ethernet interface to a
 VME bus. Since this might be handy for the Atari community, I'm asking
 your help.

 Could anyone give pointers to info on VME buses in general, and the
 Riebl cards ? I have asked this before, but the links I got were 'future'
 or on some gargantuan homepage where one gets lost in an eye-blink.

 Any info is great, but I'm looking for bus timimg cycles, data flow
 charts, etc. Electrical schemes are also great, if accompanied by 
 sufficient comments.

 Thank you,

Now that sounds interesting! Not that I've managed to run out of RAM
yet in version 1.2. Is it an expensive upgrade in Germany?

I haven't managed to get it to connect at greater than 19200 yet (on
a 300MHz PII): is this normal and if not do you know of any tips for
getting the speed up? I have a 56k modem, which is a little wasted at
19200.

TIA

I begin to get confused with this thread ;-)

I'll try to sum up:

I use Magxdesk as my... desktop, with avserver.app to expand its AV 
features, and with the env variable #_ENV AVSERVER=AVSERVER in magx.inf. 
For the fontselector problem, I have the env variable
#_ENV FONTSELECT=AVSERVER in magx.inf.

A-man is finaly just there to add some more AV features.

Of course, you can do it. Just edit the kill file, or in the dialog box 
keep only what's interesting, eg. earthlink.com.

Make sure you have maximum logging turned on, for all configs.  
Octopus is usually very good at telling you why it won't boot.

I used a Best Mouse for years that I thought was almost perfect.  
Eventually, the buttons gave out, so I had to replace it.  I bought a 
Wizard 560 (DPI) from Systems For Tomorrow and I like it even better! 
It's not quite as ergonomic as the Best Mouse, but the 560 DPI is 
very nice, eliminating any need for a software mouse accellerator.  
And the buttons with tactile switches are much, much better than the 
Best Mouse.  Give them a yell at sales@SystemsForTomorrow.com.

Hi Eric:

My ISP rep. gave me the wrong proxies and I tried to go ahead without proxies and am
able to surf the net with the Darconis/Adamas package.  It works great!  Pictures in
ST(e) med. are not that great though.  I wonder if this could be made better
(without having to add a graphics card) ... but I expect the answer to that will be
a 'no'.

Thanks for the help.

    well, I have the  original letter here in front of me from Peter 
Wood in the UK. Apparently he's gotten it to work with Imagecopy, 
Positive Image and First Word  - he used EPSON_MT.CFG as his driver in 
the latter.

    I know how you feel about getting a bum printer - I originally got 
a Canon BJC240 and found out that I couldn't switch from black and white 
to colour mode because Canon took out the dip switches (@#$%^&*). And 
the company I bought it from wouldn't take it back because I had used it!
I finally was able to make a trade at another shop for a slightly used 
HP DeskJet 540 that so far has proven itself nicely as a workhorse 
printer, though I'd like to get one of the newer ones or one of the 
Epsons....

 I use Photocopy to not only view them, but to convert them into
 gifs and at times I've converted gifs and/or jpgs into those ibm

If anyone's interested in picking up the Abacus Software series of
books on the Atari ST, I've put a couple up on the ebay auction site.


If there's enough interest I'll post more of the series, as well as
some 68000 assembly language books.

I have app. 80 atari magazines, including everything from Antic 
Magazine to ST Format. Date ranges all the way from 1986 to 1995..
So, anyone want them? I dont want any money from them, but I would
like to get a second mouse out of the deal! It doesnt even have to 
be an atari mouse, Even a nice second hand serial mouse I'd be happy 
with.. (I installed Serial 1 on the falcon).
I am located in Alberta, Canada so it would be best if you were close
as the box weighs quite a bit..
And if you really want the magazines (or need them) but have nothing
to give in return thats ok too, just email me and we'll talk :)

--Ok Next subject--

I really really want an Expose Digitzer but I have been told they
were not made anymore, does anyone have one for sale or know where I 
can get it?  I am willing to give a 4 meg STE/400meg hardrive/2 monitors/
handscanner/ etc etc in hopes that will bring the price of expose down 
a bit.. so... anyone? :)

--And finally the last issue--

As some of you may know I have made a MagiC support site, but unfortunatly
It is not everything I want it to be. This has nothing to do with me, the 
problem I have is that I have no more web space! :( I have an extremely 
updated 
version of the page (over 50 magic-specific apps! Snaps and info about MagiC
 6,Cab 2.7 etc etc) but have no where to upload it 
 to!
 I was thinking about Geocities, But they are usualy slow and I wonder
 How hard it is to uplad to your webpage? Do you have to go through the
 web to upload or what? How does that work? I once tried to register with
 them there with no luck, I must be dumb because I got lost in the 
 registration process...
 Another option I am considering is atari.de. I *think* it says that they
 provide free webspace to atari-related pages???? Does anyone know if this
 is true? as my german is not so good!

 Speaking of MagiC, i recently discovered 2 new MagiC apps. The first called
 "MagiClogin" which is by the same guy who did FIFFI. It is indeed a very 
 useful program and a nice addition to the magiC apps page.
 The second program is a Telnet program for Iconnect called "Teli" 
 and It is again made by the same guy. Now already there are *2* telnet
 clients for iconnect.. 
 we just need a IRC client now..(Although I talked to fraccy awhile ago
  he said he was considering making it compatable with Iconnect)
  --
  Oh wait, I just thought of something else!-
  --
  Ive been following the discussion about aFTP lately,
  And I have had bad results too. Ever since the latest version
  for StiK it bombs when it try's to connect to some hosts :-(
  --
  And 1 more thing..
  --
  ABout the 2 magic Mailing lists. This could be good and it could be bad.
  It could be bad if the 2 mailing lists both send out the exact news to
  everyone on the list in different words. Those (like myself) who 
  would subscribe to both would get tired of reading everything twice.
  It would be good in the sense that if 1 list missed something the other one
  would (hopefully) not miss it. I am just happy that MagiC is finally 
  getting some of the support it deserves.!
 
  Ok, well I can see many people yelling at me for making this Post so long
  and containing so many different topics in one email, so sorry in advance!
  I dont post messages here very often so when I do I want to cover everything :)
  
  Bye, if you have any problems concerning MagiC please email me and im sure 
  I can help.

Yo Robert,

As you, I just got NEWSie v0.90 from John's Web page and it works great.
I must applaud John's efforts in upgrading his software. Now that I have
a G3 Laptop, on which I use Claris E-mailer, I much prefer NEWSie! Great

Howdy,

POPWatch works great and I use it to screen all my e-mails. The best solution
for Spam is to get your local Congressmen to push for Spam reform. Before
the Washington Law was implemented, I also got mostly anonymous Spam. Not
true now. 95% of all the Spam I get these days can be rejected! You must
get your politicans to support Spam legislation <g>. It can be done...

Yo Gary,

IMHO, you should consider a G3 Laptop if possible. System Solutions will
soon have the latest version of MagiMac. So you could get that in the UK
before you leave. Be prepared that Florida is hotter than "Hades" so your
in for a bit of a shock <g>. Culture and otherwise :)

If your employer requires you to run PC stuff, the G3 will run that also
from an emulator such as Virtual PC. It's works well on a G3, which is
*very* fast. My Sister uses G3's for her business and runs MS office stuff
when necessary. She says it's a piece of cake. As I don't have MagicMac yet
I can't comment on how well it works, but from the Germans that post here,
they are very impressed by it :)

  Hi all,

   I've been getting familiar with SozobonX (v2.05) on my TT/030 and I'm
getting wierd behaviour with the fwrite() function. For example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

char test[32] = "Some test data";
FILE *outfile;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

  outfile = fopen("foo.dat", "w");
  fwrite(test, 32, 1, outfile);
  fclose(outfile);
}

 (error checking etc. omitted for simplicity)

  Now if I look at the data actually written out, it's not at all what
it should be.
  I'm reasonably proficient in C, but am I missing something here or is
it a known problem (buggy lib etc.)

  Thanks in advance,
   -Russ Magee

I have been using a Naksha for years, certainly long after other 
mice gave up the ghost. It seems to be the microswitches which fade 
and unfortunately I think this one is starting go. System Solutions 
sold, and perhaps still sell, a mouse which is identical in 
appearance (except for the logo) but which seems to have inferior 
switches. I intend taking one of the failed ones apart and seeing if 
it is possible to change the switches.

ok then, i´ll try this. i´m looking forward to get one (or two) of those
rare 74F04-FAST-TTL-chips soon. i really need my SCSI-port - although i
have an IDE-HD now -, because i owned a microtek scanner in may (in

I don't have the details but it's possible to modify the drum counter to 
disable it. If you try it then make sure that you have a spare.

You changed the drum counter when you changed the drum I assume?

I fully agree with you. A month ago I had to replace my Logitech mouse so 
I bought me a 560 DPI Wizard mouse. This is definitely a very good mouse 
(not so good as the Logitech mouse IMHO). Due it's high resolution one 
doesn't need a mouse accellerator at all.

16/32 Systems (England) is also selling this type of mouse

Yo Dude,

One thing for sure, you ain't no coward :) Once a dude gets a family,
things change. Hell, I just saw on the news that there was a "Love Fest"
in Germany with a lot of strange Germans running around with purple hair.

Yes, there is. Something freakish must have happened when I recompiled 
everything for version 1.34, because nothing was changed in the alias 
program. I recompiled it again, and now everything is fine (here, at 
least).

For those who still have it, use alias.ttp from the 1.33 distribution. 
Gary and Terry, I will send you the fixed program by email. I have 
also updated the archive on my homepage.

Yo David,

I hope you get some help with this. An Ethernet interface would be a great
help to Atari users. I'm sure others are working on this. For which Atari
or clones are compatiable, I'm not sure. It would definately be helpful for
my Falcon...

Does anyone know if it is possible in Okami, to archive news articles of 
interest? eg. to have a new internal news group called say 'archive', and 
copy/move messages to it. This would mean that I could store all articles I 
find useful and want to keep for ever, but in a format that I could easily 
access in Okami ie. just like any other newsgroup. I know I could just save 
the articles to a text file, but that's not nearly as nice.
I hope the above makes sense :)

Also what's the difference between 'locked' and 'protected' in Okami's 
message flags?

Gary

I've noticed MagxDesk doesn't update the directory after a file is saved. 
Example: I'm in qed and save a file with MagxDesk's target directory in 
the background -- the directory window doesn't get updated. Under the 
Ease desktop there's no such problem, which has a setting called 'Refresh 
window contents automatically'. Is there a way to make MagxDesk do the 
same?

That's funny, I have a soon to be upgraded 150 MHz
Pentium 48MB EDO and Xenon is almost as smooth as it
was on my ST. I have found Pacifist to be the best ST
emulator around, it runs most Games and Demos with some
of the special effects. You are using version .48 or
..49ß  I trust they are a great improvement. Download

There are drivers for:

   * MiNTnet       
   * NetBSD/Atari  (68020 or better:  TT/Falcon, clone)
   * STinG         
   
Unless you mean specific applications?  Which ones?

Another way would be to use some silver conductive paint to bridge the
broken track. That way you don't need to use a soldering iron, so there's
less chance of doing more damage. The only problem is it's very expensive,
7.49UKP for a 3g phial from Maplins. The order code is FY72P. Their web
address is <URL:http://www.maplin.co.uk/> or sales is on +44 (0)1702 554000.

I don't know about a newer version of the Atari clipboard, but in 1991 
Scott Sanders (author of The Atari Compendium) wrote a clipboard CPX 
that I've always used and still do.  That's how I got the date!  <G>

Freeware, I know it's on Genie Online Services library, so it ought to 
be on a website somewhere

Ok. Here is the description of the NOS kill file format, that I am proposing 
to implement in NEWSwatch. Any comments?

The actual Lines: example will not be relevant with NEWSwatch, because I 
have implemented that separately from the KILL file. It's actually a 
seperate preference, as is 'number of crossposting groups'.
Also I plan to have NEWSwatch keep the headers of killed articles, or 
totally ignore them depending upon another configurable preference.


-------------Taken from NNTPCLI.TXT---------------------------

    KILL

          Used to hold patterns with which received header
          lines are compared.  If certain patterns match then
          the corresponding article bodies will not be
          fetched.  The format is specified below.  If this
          file exists then all new articles will be fetched in
          two stages: header first then body.

Format of the KILL file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The kill file should contain one pattern per line.  Each
header line received is compared with every pattern until a
match occurs.  A match must be exact, with the first character
of the pattern matching the first character of the header line
and the last character of the pattern matching the last
character of the header line.  Case is insignificant and
whitespace is always represented by a single space character. 
The pattern may contain special characters as follows:

!    If the first character of a pattern is "!" then the rest
     of the line forms a "keep" pattern ("!" means don't
     kill).  If any header line matches a keep pattern then
     the article body will be fetched.

     If the first character of a pattern is not "!" then the
     whole line forms a "kill" pattern.  If any header line
     matches a kill pattern and no header line matches a keep
     pattern then the article body will not be fetched.

     The "!" character has no significance in any other
     position and will be matched literally.

?    Matches any single character.

*    Matches zero or more characters.

[ ]  Matches any single character that appears within the
     square brackets.  For example, [0123456789] will match
     any single decimal digit.  The characters can be
     specified as a range: [0-9] has the same meaning as the
     previous example.

[^ ] Matches any single character that does not appear within
     the square brackets.  For example, [^abc] will match any
     single character except "a", "b" and "c".

\    Matches the following character literally.  For example,
     \* will match a single asterisk and \\ will match a
     single backslash.

The kill file patterns are all loaded into memory at the start
of the news session - the kill file should therefore be kept
as small as possible.  Offline article selection can be
performed by creating a kill file containing the single
pattern "*".  This will cause only headers to be fetched.  The
message ids of the required articles can then be put in the
get file for retrieval during the next news session.

Example:

----------------------------------------
Lines: *[0-9][0-9][0-9]*
Newsgroups: *rec.pets*
!Newsgroups: *rec.pets.gerbils*
----------------------------------------

The first line should kill any messages with more than 99
lines.  Unfortunately some long messages do not contain a
"Lines:" line so this is not foolproof.

The second line should kill any postings or cross-postings to
the rec.pets hierarchy.

The third line will keep any postings to the rec.pets.gerbils
hierarchy regardless of any matches with the other kill
patterns.

Note that the header lines of killed articles are retained. 
The full posting can be fetched later by putting the message
id into the get file.

NEWSwatch 2.11 is now available from my web site (see sig).

This version features a small bug fix and allows for various paths to be 
defined to make it more flexible (especially when using Okami).

Enjoy!

Yup...I doubted all along it was dishonesty and thats why I posted
originaly.....Turns out it could be more a case of hmmm shall we say
bad decisions . or summat

As allways thats just my single one persons thoughts on the matter and
as always i could be wrong,And thus I wont tell everyone I am right :)

I hope thats suitably confusing....hehe

Didn't you once tell me to RTFM?  ;^)

    protected (p) means the message will not be deteled at the next 
    expire. Using this flag, important messages can be kept. When p 
    and k are both set, p prevails. 

    locked (l) means the message flags will not be affected by global 
    changes. Flags can be set for all messages in a group, so that, 
    for instance, a whole group can be deleted at once. Messages with 
    the locked flag set will not be affected by these global commands.

I agree with the ready-made lead solution however, I'm quite good with a

Not even that, all you need do is to set and save your settings in the CPX, 
and as long as the CPX header is loaded (ie you can see its title in the CPX 
loader - COPS or whatever - then the settings will be in force.

You only need to load the CPX itself if you want to CHANGE the settings.

If there is someone who is experienced in installing these cards it would be

Titan have the installation manual for download from their web site if you 
can get someone to grab it for you so you can see what's involved.

Have you renamed METAXBS.PRG to METAXBS.PRX?

If you haven't then this might well fix your problem, it's loaded by a 
component of the Spin! package and isn't supposed to be run by your boot 
manager.

You have to unsolder two surface-mount resistors and cut a couple of very

I recently aquired an Atari ST520 system is barely used.  I received
it in a trade and thought I could use it, but really can't.

Here is what I have got:

Atari 520ST
Atari Megafile 60 hard drive expansion unit
Atari SC1224 color monitor
Atari SM124 black and white monitor
Atari SMM804 printer

I have all cables and such to connect this all together.
Currently the Megafile 60 and the SM124 monitor are labeled
for 220v European power, but for all I know it is an easy 
conversion to get it to run on 120v.  If not, transformers
are available to make these run on 110 power.  I have some
but they will cost extra to ship with this.

I have absolutely no idea what this stuff is worth if anything,
but I am willing to accept offers or trades for PC and
Amiga stuff.

Everything is in perfect near new condition.  I am in the 
military in Europe, so I can ship to a U.S. or European address.

Hi Ted

seems like your getting noise on the DMA line, you can check this if you are
using an ext SCSI HDD by running the TREE_CHK.PRG program that normally
ships with Kobold, if your DMA line is noisy then it will show up as hits
(error counts).  One solution is to re-route the white wire from the buffer
away from the memory pack, alternatively you can screen it by replacing the
white wire with a screened cable but only earth one end I would suggest the
buffer end.

Regards

Mick Lock
