Price guides make money for the people publishing the guides :) They have
nothing to do with gamers. It's all supply and demand. Funcoland had herzog
zwei listed at 19.99 up till last month because they had none. Now that some
people somewhere traded a few in for 12 bucks credit they have it listed at
29.99 .
I would just chuckle to myself when someone lists sportstalk football for 5
bucks. And do the same if someone bought it for that. And keep my eyes open
because I know the same person would sell pirates gold for 15  :)

If it was as bad as 2600 graphics it would have 4 squares (oops I mean

I have a Ricoh 1420c CD-Recordable drive, software, manuals, etc that
I purchased and might consider trading it for the right deal.  I paid
$500 for the unit less than 2 years ago.  The unit is Recordable only
(not rewriteable) and is a 2x4 (2x Record, 4x Read).  The unit is SCSI
based and includes the SCSI card also.  Upgraded to the latest BIOS.
This is an excellent drive and does Disk at Once and Track at Once.
Anyway's, I started collecting old computer/console stuff a little
while back and would be might be willing to trade it for the right
deal.  Here are some things that I am looking for:

Arcade Games (would have to include shipping)
Vectrex
2600 Systems/Clones
5200 Systems
Odyssey
RCA Studio II
Intellevision
Amiga
Commodore Units
Carts from all of the above

or let me know what you have and willing to trade for it.  Looking for
most old stuff.  Prefer email but I do read the newsgroup daily so it
is fine here also.  Reason I don't need anymore is I have access to a
unit at work that I can use at home when I need to.

Thanks, Corey

I don't know what posts you are reading, but I've never bashed the 30K 
guy - I've always stated that I think he has every right to ask what he 
wants for his collection, even if it is extremely high.

If you disagree with the things I say, then by all means - feel free to 
offer your views otherwise, but if you don't like the "debate" then you 
don't have to keep posting...  but if you do, at least try to give your 
own views on the topic, instead of ignoring it all and making something 
up about my thoughts on the matter.

As a courtesy to all the newsgroups that this has been posted to, I will 
not be adding any more comments to these 30k threads.  I've stated my 
views, and many others have done the same.  Dragging it out like this 
doesn't really do much more than to antagonize each side into posting 
more flames/comments - and it's just clogging the newsgroups.

But just to make it clear - everyone has a right to sell anything they 
have... whether they enjoy the items or not, and they have the right to 
ask whatever price they want for them, even if it is unreasonable.  Just 
because a person doesn't do something exactly as you think they should, 
it shouldn't mean you call them an ass, idiot, or whatever other name.

  It may be less common than the orange lebel.  Over they years I acquired
several lots of atari games, I have not seen a red label variations.  But it's
valuable only to those who collects label variations.  I collect games mostly
to play and to make my friends jealous of my collection's size.

Hey, had I know that Tickle-Me-Elmo dolls were going to sell for $5000 last
Christmas, I would have sunk my entire savings into buying out the store!
Why? Because people were williing to pay for it! There is nothing wrong with
getting as much money out of a deal as possible. If the people don't want to
pay that much, then they don't have to buy it. It is that simple.

 I was at Atari HQ at  the launch of the Jaguar. Unfortunately I had not
finished DinoDudes so could not go (and was not invited) to the main
celebrations do. The initial dev kit was called sylvester.. Hmm Atari had a
thing about cartoons (TOM and JERRY the risc chips). and then the Alpine
Boards.  when I went to Sunnyvale debugging on the Jags was a nightmare -
then they came up with a STOP button - this froze the Jag in a state where
we could trace the machine. Whilst at SunnyVale I had to do an interview for
a Tv program (Bet I was crap) but I was given a lift there by Bill Rehbok
(left to go to Sony and know linked with Project X (Is this the new Atari
risen from the ashes ??)) who mentioned that a future version was going to
have a 68030 in it and the risc processors fixed.

    We were offered work which might have been suitable of the Jag 2 but the
writing was on the wall.

In a sense Atari burnt Imagitec in that we did the falcon versionof
DinoDudes before the Jag version (Another programmer was put on the Falcon
Version when I started on the Jag one). This was for Atari and 2 years later
I get a phone call from a PD place, officially selling the game - saking me
to remove the protection. Then it was released - by that time the Falcon was
dead. Also for the Falcon we were going to do Space Junk which contained
motion captured communication. Basically  fro each communication you had 4
sets of video (into +3 replies) each taking over a meg. We did a demo (Nigel
"Mad Freddy" Conroy (Did raiden and Pitfall 2 on the Jag - Excellent
programmer) and myself did a demo of this motion capture + a couple of
interactive sections which was about 10 meg ), Atari then said they wanted
the whole game to be on Floppies (HD) and at a maximum of 14. The game was
then cancelled.

Oops about Tempest - it just seemd like a year   8-)

I think the scenario you're talking about doesn't really deal with "honesty and 
fairness", it's really "market awareness".  You want to know if the people who 
are hell-bent on making sure that newbies are "market aware" of lower price 
availability are the same people who would make a little old church lady 
"aware" of her rare possession.

While these two situations *could* be drawn on the same piece of paper, they're 
really not worth comparing.  Helping a newbie become "market aware" could be 
seen as a public service, and may make some people feel good about themselves 
knowing that they "helped" someone.  Telling someone that the item you are 
about to purchase from them is worth fifty times their price tag is charity.  
You could compare this with contacting a random newbie and sending them a check 
for the amount of money that they've unknowingly overpaid for an item.

Hmmm..after all the posts, I felt compelled to write..
  Why does anyone CARE about what the guy charges if they're not gonna buy
the games? (Admittedly, 30K is an outrageous price for just about anything
video game related) If you're not gonna buy the games, don't go bashing the
guy telling him he's nuts, he's an ass, etc. I'm sure if he'd left it up for
auction, someone would have bought it. (They always do) Also, it depends
what was IN the collection as well. Contrary to what I just said, if the
collection had the right games (Tengen version of NES Tetris, games for the
NES R.O.B.[not even sold at Funcoland], SNES Ogre Battle, etc), 30K may NOT
have been such an outrageous price after all. About the collector issue:
sadly, most people who have collections of some sort collect ONLY with the
hope of selling their collections at a later date, or at least for the
satisfaction or watching their collections grow in value and saying to
everyone, "I told you so" ...

Hi Tommy,
An emulator is a software program that emulates.  For example, a program that
can run Atari 2600 software would be an Atari 2600 emulator.  Activision
published a package of emulated Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 games a while back,
and there is a Vectrex emulator available for free.  Hope that explains
satisfactorily!

But I guess PROFIT is all that matters to folks like you...

Anything that guy has in his collection worth playing is gonna be
easily obtainable elsewhere.  Whether you like it or not the
collection is HIS and he can sell it for what ever he damn well
pleases.  What the hell do you want him to do?  Give it to you for
free because you can't afford it?
Also if I'm in a thrift store and happen to find a rare Beatles album
or a Banana Splits lunch box for 50 cents you better believe I'm gonna
pick em up and turn around and sell them on ebay for every penny I can
get.

Yes, I agree you are "sick".  Instead of constantly bitchin about this
guy why not get out from in front of your computer and try to find
some games in the real world?  It might take a little work (as in
actually moving your body around) but at least you'll get the games
you want at the prices you want.
I can also guarantee that no one around here is gonna give you their
collection just because 'you'll give it a good home'.

  Oh brother, not this sob story!  News flash!!  The business world revolves
around profit.  Besides, kids in this country are a bunch of spoiled little
bastards anyway.  They can go without Elmo.  It won't kill em.  If people's
parents are going to pay 5000 bucks for one of those annoying little hell
spawns, I say hoard away.

  No, he didn't bash the daylights out of him....  And, its ok to debate.
That's what a newsgroup is for!  I personally am getting sick of peons who are
whining about the price of the auction.  If you didn't want to debate, you
shouldn't have started arguing in the first place.

  You don't visit newsgroups very often, do you?

I am father to a 2yr old daughter. She got an Elmo that year. She was
barely 6 months old. What's the point? She couldn't enjoy it then. I
didn't buy it, her Uncle did. If I had one of those Elmos, I'd sell it
for a few hundred. More money for me and the family.

Hi-

I have some Atari Hardware/Software I need to dispose of.  Here is a
partial list.  Please respond with email since I dont read these news
groups.

32 bit stuff
Atari Falcon 030 (4mb) (HD Drive)

16 bit stuff
Atari 1040 ST  (4mb) (DD drive)
Atari SC1224 Monitor
Atari SLM 804 Laser Printer
Atari SC1224 Color Monitor
Atari SF254 SD Disk Drive
ICD SCSI Controller Card
Practical Solutions Mouse Master (Joystick / Mouse Switch)
2 Alfa Data Mice for Atari / Amiga  (Very good mouse)
Home made box to allow use of VGA monitor with an Atari computer.  Has
high/low resolution switch

8 bit stuff
Atari 65XE (Computer)
Atari 1010 Tape Drive
Rana Systems 1000 Double Density Disk Drive
2 Atari 1050 Disk Drives (1.5 Density)
1 Atari 1050 Disk Drive - Not Working - Parts Only 
ICD PR: Connection (Parallel and Two Serial Ports)
Atari Xmm 801 printer
Nec Composite monitor.  About 13 inches.  Green Display.

I simply dont have room for this old computer stuff, so I need to get
rid of it.  All offers will be considered, but trades for PC hardware
will be given first priority.  I have a lot of software, books and
cables that I have not cataloged yet, if you want something in
particular I will let you know if I have it.  I live in Columbus Ohio,
USA.  
 
Thank you

I'm looking to get rid of my old Atari 520 ST (I'm moving and just can't
keep lugging it around anymore)  It has 1 MB of memory, one internal 3
1/2 drive and one external, joysticks, mouse, software, etc etc.  If you
know anyone that might be remotely interested in it, I would like to
give it a good home rather than tossing it in the scrapheap

Thanks,

Why

AFAIK Alpha processors are manufactured by Digital which is now owned by
Compaq and they're the one who own the technology. Judging from your
conversation Intel have bought or licenced Alpha technology, is this true?
If that's the case, where can I find more information about this since I
have obviously missed something.

But this copy part is ridiculous, Intel needs the latest in technology just
because of their efforts to keep the old structure and concept they used in
the Intel x86 processors. A concept dating back more than Intel CPU's and
that was great ... back in the 80's in the first Z80 home computers. Today
Alpha and PowerPC processors are way ahead if you compare the ratio between
technology used and performance given. Intel has often used better
technology if you look at plain electronics involved. Still they get
outperformed by relatively simple and cheap RISC processors.

  I have to agree, I think that Al does have a point here. What happens to
  the re-sellers that find out they way under-priced their goods? Do they
  learn from their lesson, (and take it as such) or do they stop dealing with
  Atari 'wares at all. Sheesh, we've had that happen way too much anyhow!
  
  Just my 2 cents worth... ;-)

I thought someone said the newsgroup was there for debate/exchange of
ideas. So how can it be getting clogged w/threads of such nature?

Maybe we should start a NG called rec.games.collecting.debate

Lighten up.

The above may not be exact, and if my brain were working properly I

What's next?  Someone trying to get $2,000 for a slightly used N64 with a
few games because it's almost mint in box?
If I see someone sell anything for such inflated price, it'd be time for me
to move into a funny farm.

To continue the incredibly off-topic thread, the episode in question is
the one where Elmer Fudd finally gets the drop on Bugs Bunny. Stuck in a
psychiatric ward for the obscenely rich, Elmer fools Bugs into taking his
place in bed. A hypnotist comes in and convinces Bugs that he is Elmer J.
Fudd, millionaire, etc. etc. One of Elmer's favorite activities, of
course, is hunting... So the bulk of the episode involves Bugs hunting
Elmer (in a rabbit suit) and Elmer getting the best of Bugs.

It ends with Bugs being dragged away to court for tax evasion, still
believing that he is Elmer. Meanwhile, the real Elmer (who isn't crazy
after all) says he may be a screwy rabbit, but at least he isn't going to
Alcatraz. 

Just to make this topical again... Wasn't there a Looney Tunes game that
was planned for the Jaguar at some point? I don't have Rob's FAQ in front
of me right this second...

KKC, gee, what a useless pieces of Usenet...

Here are some more great deals from my video game collection!!!! 
I will sell War Gods for N64 for $109.99 with slightly beaten box, and
no instructions. I will send it with the forementioned Jaguar
collection at a discount of $100.99 plus shipping (assuming the Wagon
Train can accomodate it) of $16.00. If I ship it alone shipping would
run maybe $35 or $40. I also have a slightly used controller pack for
N64 with some good Blast Corps scores I can include for $68.00. I can
include it with an "accessory pack" in addition to the Jaguar
collection, 4 Atari 2600 Joysticks, 1 Jaguar controller, 1 Jaguar RF
switch, 1 N64 controller (3rd party from Interact), one slightly
defective Genesis controller, an NES Advantage controller (defective),
a 32X to old style Genesis Jumper cable, 32X advertising pamphlets,
Genesis pamphlets, and Game Gear pamphlets, a defective Atari 2600 AC
adaptor, two defective SNES adaptors, one 2600 to TV switch
(defective), a few misc defective 300 ohm to 75 ohm converters, an FM,
UHF, splitter VHF (defective), 10 feet of defective coaxial cable (bad
shieldling), misc plastic bags used to hold video games at one time
(some defective have holes), a Genesis box (empty), various twist ties
included to wrap video game cables, and any extra junk I find. All for
$499.97 plus $109.95 shipping. ;)  

Now if this one is not funny I dont know what is.

where I can get one, please let me know.

I'm looking for a lynx with, at least, the following games:

blue lightning
war birds
slime world
xenophobe
clax
california games

I am aware of the joke.  I mean to say if sales of outrangerous priced
items actually happened, not failed auction and empty sales, then I'll
post the address to the funny farm and the visiting hours.

You do realize that Atari Karts is a Jaguar game, and has been one of
the harder to find titles for that system? (Well, it's only hard to find
if you don't shop on the internet.)

You, sir or madam, are beautiful.  Looking out for your dad like that.  Then
again, if I had a kid who would trade in my Lynx Klax, I'd moiderize him.

Video Game Liquidators has a lot of Lynx stuff for (I think) good prices. 
Their website is www.vglq.com  -- I don't work for them, just a satsfied

I would think that the Alphas only did the rendering, so it shouldn't be to hard to
port a

You think paying someone's low asking price ("low" is a subjective call anyway)
is the same as asking outrageously marked up prices for easily available
O'Shea's carts?  Like I said, it's ridiculous in two sentences and even more so
as a 500 word post.

I will continue to point out the availability of O'Shea carts in response to
posts offering them for sale at inflated prices.  And I will also continue to
buy carts, systems, and anything else that catches my eye at thrift stores and
flea markets for the asking price even if it is less than I feel the item is
worth.  Nothing hypocritical involved whatsoever...

If you feel differently, I invite you to inform all merchants in the future of
your opinion as to the true value of their wares before you make a purchase. 
(But I won't hold my breath...)

In addition to vglq (www.vglq.com, as noted in a separate response), you
may also try out Multimedia 1.0 (http://www.multimedia1.com/). I have
had good experiences with both of them, as well as with United Game
Source (http://members.aol.com/unitedgame/index.html).

I heard over in the Nintendo news group someone was saying that the
Atari landfill in Arizona / New Mexico was thought to be just an urban
legend and said Next Generation recently exposed this, is this true? I
read so many articles supporting the landfill story.For those unfamiliar
it was said that Atari dumped tractor trailer loads of 2600 ET and other
carts into a landfill mixed with cement during the great game crash
Basically it was cheaper to destroy them than trying to selling them
If this site does exsist does anyone know the location? 
Planning an archeological dig this summer to find the lost cart of
Atlantis .After finding it we could make this a national monument to
Atati an sell tickets or Oshea carts for 10.00 to uneducated tourists. :

So sue him if you have that much time on your hands...you won't get
anything out of it except maybe the right to buy his collection for
$30,000 if the judge rules in your favor...I say go for it!

Well, I haven't called the guy anything, but is he's only in it for the
PROFIT, I think most collectors would agree that they don't like him in
the hobby....it's a free country though.

Personally, I just think that people 'in the hobby' need to have more than
profit on their minds...

I've heard about that way back when Nintendo tried to jump start the video
game industry.  I do remember reading an article in a magazine (I think it
was Time, '87 or '88) that covereed the impact Nintendo had in video game.
It mentioned the great crash of '83-'84 and many companies went bankrupt,
closed, or reorganized.  One section mentioned Atari had to destroy their
unsold carts by dumping them in a landfill in the desert.

If what I read is true and my memory didn't fail me, then unsold carts are
in a landfill somewhere.  That should narrow the search for lost carts by a
lot.  (there is not many landfills to begin with anyhow)

Unfortunately, it's true.  I remember when it was first in the news, back
in 83-84.  Pretty traumatic to see a huge hole in the ground full of video
games...

Yeah, but if they've been there since '83, aren't they pretty much
destroyed and pretty deep down???

It was Tiny Toons.  There's a picture of it on the back of my Jaguar
box.  I heard it was sent back to the drawing board because Atari wasn't
satisfied with the quality.  I guess that means it's worse than
Checkered Flag.  Yikes.

For what I payed it was OK. I would not pay $60 for it, but under $15 I

The ROMs should still be good. The desert is fairly dry after all. If
they were buried, they would keep from getting too hot. Granted the
lables if they were put on the carts at the time would probably be bad.
I am surprised Atari did not save the plastic casings and just ditch
the chips, or if they were EEPROMs, erase them.

I just picked up a new Jaguar for $25 at my local KayBee.  
However, they had no games but said other KayBee stores 
are selling them cheap.  My question is does anyone know 
what titles they are selling at the Kaybee stores around you? 
Please let me know.  Thanks.

Destroyed ..HA! 
There is a web site that listed what it would take to destroy a combat
cart.The man drove his car over it (repeatedly) ,put it in boiling water
then ice water,dropped out a 2-3 story building, held a lighter under it
plus many more terrible things and it still worked.Cant remember which
web site posted it but it was hilarious.
Time could not destroy Atari ,well their carts anyway ; )

Atari collectors... here's something you're probably missing:


Atari made Video Pinball Model C-380

Several games in one!
In good shape

Asking only $65+$5 shipping

works with standard 2600 adapter (not included)
works with standard R/F modulator (included)

Thanks,

It got droped, when we examined what we could do with the CD it just no way
as flexible as the PC CD-ROMs and drivers available. Also the designer left
after doingthe PC version for 2 years, we had prototypes on the PC done but
running very slow, using Brender by Argonaut but with no hardware
acceleration on 33mhz 486/ For the Jag version we were going to license the
Jag Doom engine but we had a few problems getting the tools to work on the
Next machine. (we had to buy one and somebody had to learn how to use it)

    Hope this is of use.

Looking for Pac-man Fever record from early 1980s.  If you got a copy,
e-mail with  condition and price.  If you can't part with it, maybe making
me a cassette copy would be acceptable

You might try posting this to one of the Vinyl newsgroups. After my
"WTB" post, I got about 15 email from diff. people who had it for
sale. I was able to get the 12" LP and the 7" 45 single of Pac Man
Fever for $10 shipped (a great deal), most of the other people were
offering just the 12" LP for $10 + shipping.  Good luck

I have been to most of the Kaybee's in Southern California, and all they have
is Tempest 2000, Club Drive, Dino Dudes, and maybe one other racing game.  They
are really not selling considering the price is still about $12.

Sold all of My SNES games at a pawn shop for $3.00 a piece, at least 50 or60
games :( I  didn't have the internet yet so i didn't think of selling them
through it. That was at least 6 or $7,000. dollors worth at just $50.00 a
game, and most of them were 70 to$80. dollors agame
and some as high as$110.00 dollors like virtua racing, don't ask me why!
Well I'm just glad I didn't sell the50 or so Sega Genesis games I still have
as I now know I can do much better letting them go right here! But hey who
cares what any one else doe's, Different Freaks for Different Streets!!
 Wow when I think about it the guy at the pawn shop got them ALL for about
the price of just the one game Virtua Racing!
   Well heres hoping tomorrow it wll be my turn!
                      -See Ya -

Hi!

Is it true that the 6-switch woodgrain version of the 2600 console
slightly harder to find and may be slightly higher in price?  I saw one
for sale here, what would be the good ballpark offer to such system with
box? 

Thanks!
Sam

Hi!

	Does anyone know if Electronic Boutiques still has any of the new
Telegames titles? I really want to buy Iron Soldier II but refuse to pay
the $12.50 (shipping plus order processing charge) Telegames tacks onto
the list price.

	Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I sell REBUILT systems.. not yard sale trash. All have a 90 day warrnt. as
well. I sold well over 100+ systems last year and have nothing but happy
customers. Sure, you can find 2600's cheap at yard slaes, thift stores..ect.
But they won't be as nice as mine, or come with docs, or offer a support line
for additional parts and games. Plus I don't think 50 bukcs is a "rip off"
considering shipping is included which usually runs me $15-20.

I have the following on eBay auction check it out.
Atari Stunt Cycle Console VERY RARE Model SC-450. This unit needs nothing
else to play besides being connected to your TV. Comes with all hookups.
Excellent Condition, like new. Was tested works great. This Console or
system has 4 different games to play Stunt Cycle, Drag Race, Motocross, and
Enduro. Each game has 2 difficulty levels, Amatuer and Pro. The sound for
this system comes through the system not your TV. The sound works great, you
control the system with the handlebar with excellent grips and has the real
feel of riding a bike. Power Supply and RF Switch are included.
Item #21093125

Not true.

Compaq and Digital has merged and they have only signed a deal with Intel
to let Intel manufacture the Alpha processor. Intel doesn't own anything,
they will just produce the chip which will let them double the performance
until year 2000 with Intels tehnology (0.18 micron).

I got the same item with the Tele-Games branding for only $5 at a garage
sale. And for all I know, the Tele-Games version is even rarer.

Hi there,
        along time ago there was this cool little hand held console
called the Lynx. Unfortunately it was too bulky and had too short a
battery life and was discontinued.

The Lynx Development kit was little box from a company called Epyx,
who originaly designed the "Handy" console (a.k.a. Lynx), and the
engineers also worked on the original Amiga!!!

This little box, called Howard I think, linked to the Amiga via the
parallel port.

I was wondering if anyone had one of these development kits and the
software, possibly in a dusty corner somewhere....

Perhaps your company did Lynx development and you have a couple of
devkits in the warehouse gathering dust??

I'd really like to get hold of one, so if you have one get in touch

Cheers
Alex Holland

P.s. I dont read Usenet too often so email me direct could you??

I've seen posts from time to time where people are looking for AVP
carts.  For anyone Jaguar newbies still looking, this is as good a price
as you'll find.  It's a great game and well worth the price.

I've added some pics to my site, Sanctuary Moon.  Over the weekend, I picked
up copies of the Atari version of Q*Bert and the Konami version of Pooyan,
both ERs!  Anyway, if you don't know what my site is, it's a showcase of
classic video game systems.  It covers the Atari 2600, Atari 5200,
Intellivision, and Nintendo NES.  I have lots of pics of cartridges, screen
shots, sounds, tons of info, sounds, and a trading post.  Click on the link
to go see it.  Thanx a ton for the look!

Is there a "light-case" version of the 6-switch model? I still have my
original 2600 6-switch with woodgrain, so I assumed there was only one
type. But now you've got me wondering...

The heavy case is the very first release model.  The plastic shell were a
hefty 1/4th  of an inch!  You are more likely to have the llighter
version, unless you were the first in line to buy a 2600.  You can take
it apart and see how thick the bottom case is.

AOL claims there is no such AtariW member.  The URL returned 'Not Found', with and
without the index.html.
I checked that member and even tried to register it with AIM.  It was unused.

Could be fraud?  Unless I can get clear answer, I could refer this post to postal
service for possible mail fraud.

I am interested in the Lynx Sunvisor, Would you be willing to ship
Postal Serivce? Costing only about 2$ tops.

Also, I need a visor for the First Lynx, NOT the second, is that a
problem?

I may want a game or two, im not sure. I definitely need a visor.

You may want to try a dealer with Bits O Fun or B& C then.  EB hasn't had IS2

Heya...  I'm looking to trade in the 'ol Lynx. It includes NFL Football,
Ninja Gaiden I, Batman Returns, and Hard Drivin' with all documentation and
the Lynx system box (the games were included with this package). It happens
to be a Lynx II model, with no scratches I could spot. It's in *perfect* mint
condition and even has most if not all of its original packing materials,
reg. cards, brochres, et al. None of the games have boxes, because, well,
they came with the Lynx. I am looking for Jaguar games however, to fill my
collection. Here's the lowdown on what I'm looking for...preferably (heavy
preference) with boxes, docs, and overlays where applicable...

* Atari Karts
* Iron Soldier II (CD or Cart)
* World Tour Racing
* Worms
AirCars
Brutal Sports Football
* Catbox Adapter
Sensible Soccer
Doom
Theme Park
Troy Aikman Football
Pinball Fantasies
* Primal Rage CD
* Defender 2000
* Breakout 2000
Power Drive Rally
Flashback
Dragons Lair
Space Ace
* Braindead 13
Alien Vs. Predator (No box/docs needed. My copy crapped out...just need cart)
Cannon Fodder
Double Dragon 5
* Rayman
* ProController
* Arcade Joystick (I used to have one then traded it...forgot the name of it.)

* - Preferred

A long list, I know, but that's all the games left I need to complete my
Jaguar collection. :) All the other games (ala any I haven't listed), I
already have. Make me a deal I can't refuse and the Lynx is yours. References
are required. I send everything USPS 3-Day Priority Mail within 3 Days of
trade confirmation and have a long reference list @ eBay (search
'fallenangel' there). I'm sure some of my old trading buddies from here still
hang out in this NG anyhow. :) Alright, enough rambling. Make me an offer and
send it to sidg@sidg.net. Thanks for lookin!

ET?  My local toy store still stocks Missle Command and Yars' Revenge for 50 cents
each.  Even today, they have a few laying around gathering dusts.  If they throw
in free Dust Buster, I could but up the entire stock just to put it out of misery.

Now that you mentioned the prototypes, please tell me where is that landfill!  I
want to have a proto that  can call my own.  Prefereably cheap or free, not for
$50 or so I often see at eBay.

I've added more pics to my classic video games site, Sanctuary Moon.  I've
added pics for the NES (Galaga, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and
Burgertime), and Atari 2600 (Coconuts).

http://members.xoom.com/SancMoon/index.html

The site is dedicated to the rememberance of the classic video games systems
Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Intellivision, and NES.  There are lots of pics,
sounds, screen stills, and more, plus a trading post.  Please check me out. 
I think you'll enjoy it.

BTW, I have an Atari 2600 system with 10 games I'd like to sell or trade. 
Mail me for the details, offers, or just to say hi.  Thanx!

I just bought a GXTV earlier tonight, mainly because my trusty old Commodore
1084S is on its last legs. It has a nice picture with my PlayStation,
Saturn, and Jaguar. Aside from the fact that there's no horizontal or
vertical resize (so the screen is slightly cut off on the right), the
picture quality seems better than the 1084S on composite (the Jag looked
much better using RGB on the 1084S, but my RGB cable has bitten the dust,
and my 9-year-old 1084S looks like it's about to as well). The sound system
is absolutely incredible for a unit of this size and price. There are many
other thoughtful touches that make this seem like a very good TV for video
game freaks.

However, there's one really glaring flaw. I CAN'T TUNE IN A GOOD TV PICTURE!

OK, I admit, I bought the GXTV for video games first, television second. And
except for the minor gripes mentioned above, I'm pleased with it as a video
game product. I also admit that I'm using an antenna connection (no cable in
the room where the GXTV is), but I also have a 9" Zenith TV and a 3" Casio
TV which are both getting better reception despite being older (the Zenith
is nearly seven years old) and cheaper. The sound on TV broadcasts generally
comes in fine, but no matter how I position the antennas, the picture is
terribly snowy. At its best, the snow is reduced to a few diagonally
arranged lines of dots, but this is still too annoying for me.

I'd much rather use the GXTV for TV viewing for several reasons such as
screen size, stereo sound, and remote control operation. However, if I can't
use it acceptably, then this defeats part of the purpose of my purchasing
the GXTV.

If you own a GXTV, have you tried watching TV on it using the supplied
antenna? If so, do you get a clear picture, or do you have to put up with
constant snow? If the snow isn't going to go away (even if I exchange the
GXTV for another one), would you still keep the GXTV, or do you have an
alternative that you would recommend that is of comparable size and priced
in the $150-$250 range? Also, if someone could name a good, reliable source
for Commodore 1084S monitors, please do so, as I am still open to the
possibility of purchasing another one of these.

>my trusty old Commodore 1084S is on its last legs.

Ahhh... my first RGB monitor.  It opened up a whole new level of console
gaming.  I remember well the first night I hacked together RGB cables for my
Super NES and Sega Genesis so many years past.

>do you have an
>alternative that you would recommend that is of comparable size and priced

Well, for that price range, I would recommend an Analog RGB Arcade monitor.
If you think you like the 1084S, wait until you see your PlayStation on a
19" (under $200) or 27" (under $300) unit (both cheaper used, look around
for local arcade distributors).  There absolutely is NO comparison.  While
it might not be the most attractive alternative (open frame), the picture
more than makes up for it.  Plus, if you have the know-how, you can even
begin using Arcade PCBs.  You'll need to hack a SCART cable and add a LM1881
to extract the proper sync unless you already have one.

As for sound, spend $100-200 on a PC multimedia setup with subwoofer or use
an existing stereo system.

You don't need to even take it apart to see how thick the bottom shell
is.  Just look at the sides of the unit, that will tell you...

The landfill was supposed to be in Arizona or new Mexico .It has been
implied that the carts were mixed with concrete to prevent people from
pawing through it like a bunch of common racoons.
 It was also speculated about 18 semis full of carts an 2600 systems
were dumped. I too heard about cabinets being disposed of but not by
Atari. I thought this was more disheartened arcade owners that could not
sell them after they closed up shop and destroyed them instead of
storing when the arcades crashed. 
 
So Whos up for going to the Atari con in Vegas
getting drunk and heading out to the desert in the middle of the night
to look for a lost landfill of cement filled ET carts,sounds like fun ;

While these dump sites may very well exist, I would say that this is a very
gratuitous exaggeration of the true volume disposed of.

Hmmm...  Ever see the movie, "City Slickers II"?  But it sounds like fun to
me...  ;)

$50 isn't cheap, but its not a rip-off either.  He has to drive around
looking for these things, lay out $5 or so per console, clean them up,
repair joysticks (etc), pack 'em up, and ship them.  If he clears $25
each, he's probably making $10-15/hour.  

It seems like a fair price for buyers interested in convenience.  He
could charge less, but he's not running a charity.

Just my two cents.

Want to trade for JagCD unit, used or new, with all accessories.

I have the following carts to trade:

Cat One:
Fight For Life
Atari Karts, No box/instr.

Cat Two:
Double Dragon 5
Aliens Vs. Predator, No box/instr.
Wolfenstein 3d
Doom, No box/instr.

Will trade three games for the JagCD, one from catagory one, two from
catagory two, Or more if you have extra games to offer for JagCD.

Will also trade three games from catagory two for the Jag CD or a copy of
Defender 2000.

I also have the following accessories I will trade for:

universal ac adapter that will drive SNES, Genesis, Jag, TG16, and others.

Jag RF box

Jaglink cable, would prefer to let this go with Doom, since that's the only
game you can use it with for now. (I think)

I also have two brand new Jag controllers, no boxes

So if anyone has an extra JagCD, or one they just are sick and tired of, let
me know, we can work out a decent trade that'll benefit both of us.

I really don't want to spend any money on a JagCD ever since Denis Mcdonald
(jahnya@aol.com) ripped me off last month for one. Anyone heard from this
guy yet?

does not give a precise location......

According to Leonard Herman's book, "Atari loaded excess inventory onto 14
trailer trucks and took them to an Alamorgordo, New Mexico landfill where they
were buried in cement."


Hope this excerpt can clear things up.

     I have a GXTV and noticed the same poor antenna reception.  I think it
has more to do with how modern TVs are built these days (as some other
posters have also suggested) then a deficient GXTV.  My best advice to you
is...  Get cable.  :P

One time I was with a friend in my driveway tossing around the
basketball.  Well, given the way we were playing we ended up losing
the ball in a big pine tree.  We got a ladder and a baseball bat and
started poking the thing out when an Atari Surround cartridge fell
out.  It had to have been in the tree at least two years.  Snow, sun,
rain, birds...  Popped it into the 2600 and it ran like a dream.

Why bother building a good Tuner when people are just gonna use cable?
There are no good TV Tuners anymore, you might be better off looking
for an old TV, the reception will always be better with these older
sets.
However though there might be another problem.
Is your tuner set to TV?  On a lot of sets you have to set it to Air
(as opposed to Cable) to pick up stuff off the air.
Make sure it is set properly to pick up stuff off the air before
giving up on it.

Hi Tommy,
An emulator is a software program that emulates.  For example, a program that
can run Atari 2600 software would be an Atari 2600 emulator.  Activision
published a package of emulated Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 games a while back,
and there is a Vectrex emulator available for free.  Hope that explains
satisfactorily!

I would guess it's because it might have cost more if the let us grab freebies
and the resold them.  Don't forget a few prototypes are in there and back
then, they might have all been a hush-hush.  I wouldn't be surprised if the
missing SwordQuest series #4 (Air World) are in there somewhere.

Seriously, I think the effort to retrieve those games aren't worth it.  You'd
need
to bring a portable jackhammer to break apart those cement and that could break
up the game carts.  To use small pick to chip away cement would take a long
time.

They added cement to keep people from contemplating about going out an
bringing them back to retailers for a refund. Especially the 2600 who
then in turn would send them back to Atari for replacment stock.
Today some retailers are told by Sony or Nintendo to throw away returned
games. These retailers write it off for credit then compact it.(well in
most cases, : ).. I admit to nothing)

But you can easily short circuit the cart by plugging a 2600 power
adaptor in and rub the connector with the cart.  Sparks fly and that is
all that it takes.

That's a good point I gotta admit, but until my college supplies cable to

University of Hawaii at Manoa have to suffer if we have one of these new
television sets!  I know all the students have been complaining at UH to

Yup, this is certainly one thing you have to check.  On my tv which is
also made by Samsung(not a GXTV though) there is a menu where you select
Standard(Cable TV), Air(Ovewr the air broadcasting), and a third option
which I don't know what it's for since I never had a reason to use it.
And believe me, trying to use the regular rabbit ear antennas don't do
shit if the set is tuned for Cable TV(Standard).  You gotta switch to Air,
or else the picture will just be full of crap!  Probably one of the
reasons is that the set adjusts its sensitivity to the quality of the
signal since cable signals generally have little or no static while Air
broacasts can easily be overridden by other appliances and devices
transmitting on air frequencies such as police scanners and whatnot.  See
if that works, and if there is no switch for this than I suggest getting a
decent little set that has this option because I'm assuming GXTVs are made
for those people who are more than willing to blow money on everything to
spice up their gaming!  And they're probably assuming that if you'll spend
money just to play your games with a crystal clear picture, you probably
pay for cable too.  But who knows right?

Maybe it's the University's way of telling the students they should try
studying instead of watching TV...

I have a Ricoh 1420c CD-Recordable drive, software, manuals, etc that
I purchased and might consider trading it for the right deal.  I paid
$500 for the unit less than 2 years ago.  The unit is Recordable only
(not rewriteable) and is a 2x4 (2x Record, 4x Read).  The unit is SCSI
based and includes the SCSI card also.  Upgraded to the latest BIOS.
This is an excellent drive and does Disk at Once and Track at Once.
Anyway's, I started collecting old computer/console stuff a little
while back and would be might be willing to trade it for the right
deal.  Here are some things that I am looking for:

Arcade Games (would have to include shipping)
Vectrex
2600 Systems/Clones
5200 Systems
Odyssey
RCA Studio II
Intellevision
Amiga
Commodore Units
Carts from all of the above

or let me know what you have and willing to trade for it.  Looking for
most old stuff.  Prefer email but I do read the newsgroup daily so it
is fine here also.  Reason I don't need anymore is I have access to a
unit at work that I can use at home when I need to.

Thanks, Corey

If all they did was add cement, go get your shovels and dig, dig, dig!
You'll find lots of dusty but working carts.

Now if they used concrete, then I'd write them off...

 5.  When your matrix is full, you earn $600.  From this the
     company retains $250, and you receive a AT&T PCS Digital
     Phone with 30 minutes of pre-paid time.  You will also receive
     a pre-paid phone card with 60 minutes of domestic calling time,
     and another 300 MLM leads with phone numbers.  The balance of
     $350 is paid directly to you.

     NOTE:  No credit checks, deposits or other restrictions are
            made on the digital phone.

 6.  You also automatically recycle back into the highest position
     available in your existing matrix when you earn your $600.

 7.  The second time your complete your cycle of 14 entries or
     recycles to complete your next matrix, you will again earn
     $600, but this time the company retains only $100.  For the
     $100 retained, the company sends you 300 new MLM leads, adds
     30 minutes of pre-paid minutes on your AT&T digital phone,
     and gives you another 60 minute pre-paid phone card.

     You receive the balance, or a $500 check.

     You also receive a new position in your existing matrix to
     start the recycle process all over again.  This new matrix
     can be filled with new people you have sponsored, those your
     upline fills for you, and those from your previous matrix
     that have recycled.  This causes you to earn from the efforts
     of those you have sponsored, and gives you an incentive to
     encourage them to be successful.

 8.  There is no limit on the number of cycles you can attain each
     day.

 9.  The company pays daily!

	Well, if you're drunk enough you could always cross the boarder
for some small explosive devices.  That is, asuming the carts were only 
covered in concrete, not mixed with it.  (On the other hand, considering
how tough 2600 carts are, maybe they would survive a stick of dynamite...

I know that.  I've seen many CD's and CD-ROM's ruined in a hurry.  A little
heat and they becomes warped.  A little scratch or 2 and they're no good.
Leave them in the hands of a 4 year old kid and your CD are covered in
gooey candy & also ruined in some cases.

I may test this theory on newer carts, specifically SNES carts and see if
the durability still holds or if they should take a lesson from Atari.
FuncoLand has a bunch of Super Scope 6 games cart for a dime each.  I might
get a few and throw in a few new torutures like washer/dryer abuse.  If I
do this, I'll post the result in here for anyone to have a laughing fit.

Since this topic has come up, I'll let you all know that I have an N64 cart
that survived a drop into the kitchen sink full of hot, soapy water.  It was
under water for nearly 10 minutes and had to be drained and dried and then
cleaned to get all the soap residue off.  But it still works 100%...
Anyway, it is a Tetrisphere cart - the ex Jaguar title from H20 that was
purchased by Nintendo.  ...Hardly a washer/dryer torture test, but I was
pleasantly surprised that it survived.  ...The label did come off, though.

i tend to see the silver and the red labels the least..... the blue with

I almost went ahead and just replied Activision, thinking they were by
far the best, no question about it. But then I thought of some of Parker
Bros. games, in particular the Empire Strikes Back cart. The PB games
definitely didn't look like much, but they could be very fun.

I think I'd say Activision had the best, most consistently challenging
and satisfying games, but some PB games were pretty good too.

And I never quite got why so many people seemed to like Imagic games. I
thought they almost universally stunk. They had fairly good graphics,
but the gameplay was usually pretty dull.

Oh well, just my 2 cents....

Steve

   I found a 2600 cart today I was wondering if anyone could help me with. It's
Baseball by Telegames.It is a silver text label.There is no copyright date or
any serial number.Is this the same as Super Challenge Baseball that's listed
under the Telegames heading on the rarity list? Also,I can't get it to work.I
tried cleaning it with alcohol and a q-tip but no luck.Any other ideas? That
pisses me off because I need this game. Here is what the label says( no
pictures)

"BASEBALL-in a square

Video Game Cartridge for Atari 2600 Game Consoles.

This product is manufactured under worldwide license by--

     TELEGAMES

Turn console off before inserting or removing game cartridge.

*Atari is a trademark of Atari Inc."

    I would appreciate any help you could give me about this game. Espically
how to get it working  :-) Thanks in advance.

Memory will have to be my guide Im spoiled on new console graphics.
The ones I played the most were
Asteroids - turned over that 100,000 mark a few times
Missle Command -could never beat that thing wave 13-14 stopped me cold.
Had to defend 1 city  by that point preferrably close to the missle base
: ) 
Demon Attack-cool variation on Pheonix & Space Invaders.
Riddle of the Spinx- seemed good to me at the time I loved that multi

BTW-Did anyone else think Pac-Man looked lke he was chewing tobacco.
I never did like Pitfall it just did not appeal to me. Guess my vote
goes to Atari then Imagic.

I've been using my GXTV as a TV and a game monitor, and I have gotten
some snow due to the fact I live right next to a bunch of mountains, and
that gums up signals pretty well.

There's two local channels I cannot get at all, one is crystal-clear,
four are acceptable, and the rest are snowed to oblivion.   And this is
using the supplied antenna.   Other small TVs have similar reception in
my area.

So it might be worth getting a rooftop antenna or cable.

 The game was about 80% complete from what I was told, but it never got done.
You'll never see it unless someone with a flashrom of it brings the uncompleted
version to a show...

Uh ... Xenophobe! was released on three Atari systems: The Lynx, the 7800
and the 2600. There's also an XE prototype out there. Can you specify the
system please?

When I was a kid, I never even had Any actual "Atari" games.. I had Sears ones
and Just about all of the "Original" Activision ones.. My vote would have to be
Activision for the best games.

Well, I just got my first 7800 (Thanks Dan!) and I love it. However, let me
ask this:

Can I use my Atari trackball, and Wico red ball joysticks on it? It seems
that (in a few games anyway) that the two buttons on the 7800 are separate
and when use together will produce different results than just one or the
other by itself. However, the other controllers (trackball and Wico) are
single-button controllers - at least in the sense that each button works the
same as the other...

Thanks!

The ROM chips would still be salvageable even if this was the case. If
they just dumped concrete over the carts that were in a hole, chances
are most would be salvageable if not protected.

Systems? Cool! first I heard of that. I think it is time we should
organize an expedition down there and find the stuff once and for all.

I am not taking a trip to New Mexico to search deserts anytime soon, I
heard it was 126 degrees in Arizona, cant be much hotter than that in
that region probably would have to go at night, at night you would have
less chance of finding it even with maps. Does anyone know the exact
location anyway?

My old B&W Zenith from 1971 (still with tubes!) has tube based
amplification on all reception through antennas, on UHF I can get
stations from Erie PA, Ohio, Canada, plus the local areas (I am near
Buffalo NY), most of the VHF stuff is filled with locals and canadian
channels. One time when nothing was on I watched Inside Edition out of
some Channel 35 (I guess it was Erie PA) and got a good picture. My
newer 13 inch (color) gets the same VHF stations (but I have to use an
Emerson Amplified antenna to do it), and fewer UHF channels.

Not true, you still need a good tuner. I have a GE TV hooked up to
cable that does terrible on high channels even with a signal amp, but
my other TV has a good tuner and gets them better. Zenith TVs still
seem to have decent tuners IMO, but nowhere near as good as they used
to be.

People rather get them for free instead of $1 I guess. The Cement
probably would leave any ROM chips/circuit boards unharmed since
genuine Atari carts have that protective cover on the bottom.

Stores throw out good unreturnables, I remember it at a going out of
business sale at Kmart, tons of TVs, mismatched stereo components,
oddball sized oil and air filters, bowling balls, all ended up in the
dumpster. The next day I went to a store called Kelly's Closeouts in
the same plaza where Kmart was, there were a bunch of people with
trucks loading the stuff up. Most of it was perfectly good but couldnt
be sold since no one was willing to buy it. Happened when Sun TV closed
and reopened, when they reopened after the going out of business sale
(a year later) they disposed of some old broken equipment and old
display setups, I am sure some of the stuff was good for something,
most valuable was probably the CD case that played CDs for you to
listen to from the top 10 charts, some old guy took it, probably still
worked too.

Not necessarily, depends on how they did it. If they mixed the carts in
cement then pourt it in, the space between cement/carts would be thin
and would require little effort to break. If they dumped concrete over
the whole mess of carts, break through it or dig under it, some carts
may be damaged, but there probably are some recoverable.

Why not try a Jaguar game? Checkered Flag perhaps, it is available and
cheap, used you might throw over a dollar to test it, would be quite
interesting. Jag carts feel more solid than SNES ones. My idea for a
new test, run over it with a lawnmower.

Cement would break apart rather easily (still be a pain, not as hard as
concrete)

Depends on how they did it too, if they just poured it over the top of
a big hole full of carts, all you would have to do is break through it,
or dig under it.

Well even if the carts did survive, no telling what else was dumped in
there .Government & coorperations do not seem to mind dumping toxic or
radioactive waste near cities or playgrounds. Just imagine what they put
out in the desert with a bunch Bud drinking lizards not to mention all
the other garbage that coud be piled on top of it  . Would be a neat
dream to stumble upon till then I guress Ill have to settle for garage
sales ; )

I know you can use a Wico stick on it, and I would assume the trackball as 
well (don't know why there would be a problem).  However, as you noted some 
7800 games require the two separate functioning buttons, and the Wico stick 
buttons are not wired differently so they won't operate the different 
functions.  For one button games they're fine...

I'm sure this whole debate is less than serious, but just so you know, even if
the carts were dumped in a regular landfill, the surrounding trash would have
begun to decompose generating gasses and other products which would make the
carts unusable.

Almost forgot about Parker Brothers, who made my favorite games at the time. 
They had a lock on some of the best licenses:

QBert
Star Wars (from Atari games!)
Reactor
Frogger
Popeye (from Nintendo!)
Super Cobra

but IMHO these don't hold up as well as they did back in the day.  Especially
when this average was brought down by tripe like Strawberry Shortcake, GI Joe,
Amidar, Tutankham (no, NOT a very good arcade game!), Spider-Man ... need I go
on?

Indulge me, I'd like to rethink my rankings ...

1. Activision
2. Imagic (good hit-to-dud ratio)
3. Atari
4. PARKER BROTHERS 
5. SEGA (also made many games that didn't suck)

Any computer has an OS, even if it's just a few dozen bytes hardwired into ROM
like the Atari 2600 carries.  If you don't have something to boot from, you're
not going to run any software.  Sounds like someone's too used to a certain
Microsoft-bloated multi-megabyte OS taking up overhead.

Probably an old question, but i cant remember.  Is there a way to "win"
pitfall.  I have run out the entire 20 min a couple of times, but the
screen just freezes at the end.  I think my best score was 68000 or
something.

Let me first say that several weeks ago I politely e-mailed 30k auction guy to
suggest to him that he would not get anything near 30K for his collection.

Having said that, I am amazed (though I shouldn't be) at the venom you guys
spewed over this, and I wonder if your response would have been FUNDAMENTALLY
different if the guy's price had been merely high (20k) or more realistic (say,
12-15k).  How many of you even know exactly what the guy has? Very few of you,
I'll bet.  Yet people have blathered that the guy would be lucky to get $3,000,
his collection isn't worth crap, etc etc.  

Even though the 30k figure is ridiculous, the guy's collection is worth a VAST
sum of money, which only 1 or 2 posters seem to acknowledge.  I think that what
we're seeing here, once again,  is that many/most people here are insanely
angry over the great value of rare carts (thus the stuck-pig sqealing over the
fact that the new DP guide WILL have prices) and so they are furious with this
guy.  Hurts to know that he has a collection that you will NEVER see due to
those damn high prices, huh?

What do you people think the collection IS worth?   A guy shelled out $7,500
for my Atari 2600 collection (and a Johnny-come-lately INSISTED he would have
paid $10,000 after I had sold).  And my collection was significantly less
valuable than the 2600 collection the 30K guy has.  Yes, the 2600 collection is
the core of his offering and I repeat that 30k total is ridiculous.  But I also
repeat that what he has--with the Activision patches, mag collection, complete
CV, Vectrex, etc., is worth a HUGE amount of money, though we may debate how
huge.

One of the guy's main misunderstandings is his belief that somehow the
collection is worth more as a collection than if parted out.  Yet if he parted
it out I would not be shocked if he got close to $15,000 or $20,000. As angry
as it may make you, the guy is not nuts (though his price is unrealistic) and
he is sitting on a gold mine.  I've said it before, I'll say it again: 90% of
those fulminating about cart prices and high-priced collections are people
whose collections are worth squat.

Well yeah, Im not serious about going to some landfill out in the middle
of nowhere, but if it was down the street from me..well then yes I would
be playing racoon as we speak even if it ment going over the fence at
night time provided there was no suspicious looking 55 gallon drums
marked Springfield Nuclear Power Plant      : )  (You just cant trust

I remember reading something about that in an old video game mag.(Can
remember the name) Well, any way it said it was one cart ET. They made

I can`t find it, sorry.

Looking for info on the Atari 1040 stf

I'd like to know what the big difference is between this model
and the 1040st/1040ste is.

Also, what type of serial port does it have? Will I need a special
cable to run any external modem?

Some of this is covered in the Quick FAQ, but the modem part is not, I
don't think.

Maybe not. The first pics of Checkered Flag looked good. The end result
didnt look anywhere near as good.

In March of this year I attempted to purchase an Atari Jaguar system
from a Tim (thedreamaster@geocities.com).  I sent the money to 1700 S.
Calhoun Rd. in New Berlin, WI  53151 on March 30.  He cashed the money
order on April 3.  As of this posting I have not recieved game or money
back, and he has stopped answering my e-mail.  If anyone does business
with this person and looses their money I will not be surprised.

Wouldn't it be great if there were a newsgroup where things
like this could get cross-posted?  I've only been burned once
in a great many 'net transactions, but info like this really
needs to get out ... and people like this "thedreamaster" need
to burned at the stake in the town square.

Hope you didn't get burned for too much dough and further hope
you haven't lost faith in those of us who trade/sell fairly and

Some may remember a post I made about a month ago offering mint in box 
Espials.  Well I've got a couple left over as a couple people reserved a copy
but never followed through with payment.
 
This is the Extremely Rare Tigervision game ESPIAL for the Atari 2600.
It is MINT in box (maybe someone who bought one can attest to that).
Price is $25 + $3 for airmail shipping to anywhere in the world.
                                                   
Email to reserve a copy, copies will be held on a first come, first served 
basis.
 
Thanks,
Andrew

I have the following Jaguar games for trade:

- Power Drive Rally (complete)
- Checkered Flag (complete, box has a crease)
- Cybermorph (unless I decide to do a stress test on it, similar to
              the recent 2600 cart thread.  I think this would be more
	      fun than the actual game is :)


Here are some of the games I'm looking for:

- Club Drive
- Brutal Sports Football
- NBA Jam TE
- AvP (had it before, would like to hear it through my new stereo)

or let me know what other games you have for trade.  

Thanks,

-Matt

Well, I don't know what you saw in his collection, but I don't remember him
saying his stuff was all sealed and in mint condition.  Sure, you got great
offers on your collection and to some people it was probably worth what was
paid or more.  For myself, I wouldn't have paid more than a few hundred for the
whole lot of your rare games.  To me, your collection was squat.  I just don't
feel "rare" carts that I never played or even heard about as a kid have any
value to me. 

I read your explanation a while back as to why you sold your stuff and looking
back I think you are full of it.  When all is said and done, you are just a
speculator like those fools who are snatching up Beanie Babies.  If you really
enjoyed collecting, you wouldn't have sold your stuff which presumably you
spent years collecting. 

I have a lot of consoles and games.  Actually, I probably have more than 90% of
the people on this group and my stuff is in really awesome condition.  I have
been collecting for about 10 years and I for one am strongly opposed to the
price guide approach to collecting.  I love playing my games and they're not
for sale.  Not even if someone offered me tons of cash.  Ok, maybe for $1
million, but only because with that amount I know I could track down a lot of
the same stuff all over again.  

I don't think people are "hurt" that you or this guy had some rare carts.  I
personally disagree that there is even such a thing as a rare Atari cart since
these things were all mass produced and are not antiques in the classical
sense.  As long as places like O'shea and other secret stockpiles of these
things keep turning up, we will never know for sure how rare any of this stuff
is.  Sure, right now there are lots of people collecting and lots of demand and
saturation of the available supply at swaps and thrifts.  However, have you
stopped and looked at Ebay lately and seen how many rares go for cheaper than
most of us would expect?  It's a lot of them and it may be because there are
fewer collectors after rare 2600 carts than after a few of the choice games
they remember or have heard of(ie Chase the Chuckwagon, Tooth Protectors,
etc...)

Just a thought, if these carts are ever recovered, wouldn't the sudden 
appearance of thousands of carts cause a major devaluation of all those 
rare items? Maybe they should be left there!

Thanks Bojay.
Well said 
I dont give a rats hinney about what I dont have.
Rare ,sealed or pickeled if I find one cheap great, if not- Oh well.Its
not like there isnt enough other carts an games out there to keep me
busy. Its about playing with your toys not putting them up for future
return for some assine price guide approval ,an whats rare ? Most this
stuff does not recoup its original purchase price look at what the
response is if someone tries to sell a 2600 system for more than 30.00.
This 30k guy was being laughed at for his loss of reality. Sure it was
worth alot but who would just throw that kind of money around
 Unless they were new they would have most of it .Im fairly new to this
and ive already amassed 49 different systems and 198 different Atari
carts in the last 10 months out of thrift stores an garage sales plus a
whole lot of other carts for every other system. Price guide will not
affect me unless the lady at the thrift is told about " THE GUIDE "
Frankly we just dont need or want a guide or overvalued stock ,we need
more playtime .

Thanks  -not as well said : )

I agree. I do have both on my pages, but the good traders are the ones I
traded succesfully with. You can use the page at :

A good trader list can be abused just as much as a bad trader list.

I don't think you're going to find shops that just sell Atari stuff.  There are
thrifts in just about every city, but they are all searched almost daily by
collectors.

Well, Bojay, what condition was the collection in?  At least I know what is in
his collection; you've missed the larger point about people spouting off in the
absence of any knowledge about specifics.


<< Sure, you got great
>offers on your collection and to some people it was probably worth what was

Your larger point being what?  To my parents my collection was worth squat.  Is
there some significance to the fact that you, and millions of others, wouldn't
pay anything for my collection?
I imagine there are entire third world nations that would pay nothing for the
Mona Lisa.
 
<<I just don't feel "rare" carts that I never played or even heard about as a
kid have any
>value to me. 
  
Then the entire discussion should be irrelevant to you.  You are not a
collector, obviously.

>I read your explanation a while back as to why you sold your stuff and
>looking
>back I think you are full of it. 

Well, as long as we are at this level,  I frankly  believe that you never
learned how to think.


<< When all is said and done, you are just a
>speculator like those fools who are snatching up Beanie Babies.  If you
>really
>enjoyed collecting, you wouldn't have sold your stuff which presumably you
>spent years collecting. 

This proves my previous point.  Where is the logic here?  Ooops, that dirty "L"
word.  Uhh . . . if one sells ones collection that means one did not or does
not "really enjoy collecting"?  As soon as I  sold the stuff (hmmm, could it be
POSSIBLE that I needed money?) , I started over again.  Strange, since my
actions prove I don't enjoy collecting.  I guess Sean Kelley doesn't enjpy
collecting either, since he sold his 2600 collection a while back . . . still
trying to figure out why he put together that DP CD since those who sell their
collections are mere speculators . . . 

>I have a lot of consoles and games.  Actually, I probably have more than 90%
>of the people on this group and my stuff is in really awesome condition. 

Very odd since rare carts that you never played "have no value" to you.

 I have

So you WOULD sell your stuff, it's just a disagreement over how much money. 
BTW, what if you NEEDED money?

>I don't think people are "hurt" that you or this guy had some rare carts. 

Last time this discussion came up, several people came clean and acknowledged
that their hatred for price guides, the whole money issue in general, was
rooted in the difficulty it caused in their trying to build collections.  This
is only natural but it should be acknowledged.  I think it is naive to deny
that people get very frustrated knowing they can't get certin carts because
they are simply worth too much.

< I personally disagree that there is even such a thing as a rare Atari cart

Sigh, there's that darn logic again.  Because we don't <know> how many
Calkwalks are out there, they are not rare?  The fact that O'Sheas turned up
millions of late release commons means it is entirely possible that thousands
of River Patrols may soon surface?  I love your comment, "these things were all
mass produced."  By this reasoning, there should be neither price guides nor
scarcity guides.  Hell, in Bojayspeak, that copy of the Declaration of
Independence that sold for 2 million isn't rare, because we don't know how many
copies are produced, ot how many others may turn up behind old picture frames!

Larger point? How related to my original post?  Are you suggesting that rares
(which really are a figment of our imaginations) aren't worth all that much? 
They are worth what they go for, which at the moment is quite a bit. Maybe that
will change in five years.  Finally, since you have a huge collection, Bojay,
and since rares have no value to you in that you never palyed them, will you
please send your rares to me, to back up what you preach?  I swear on the bible
of Atari that they will simply go into my new collection and I will never sell
them.

It is selling as a package (all together) at haggle.com:

It works on an auction system.  Highest price will win the package.

P.S. My old e-mail accounts all still work, but I'd prefer it if
people would begin to use the *new* account.  Thank you!


NOTE:  If rec.game.video.classic holds true to form someone
will follow up my announcement with lies and/or attacks.  I left
that newsgroup approximately 2 years ago, and except for 2 days
in August 1997, I haven't read or posted there since (unless it was
to cross-post an occasional web site addition announcement or,
when I still did so, to occasionally cross-post four -- not 6 -- FS/T
lists).

However, I still receive e-mail from people who tell me that some
there are STILL talking about me.  Very touching, now grow up!

For the record, I will continue to cross-post these types of
announcements there because the vast majority of the people
on RGVC probably enjoy video game related activities more
than the RGVC tradition of seeing how far you can stick the
"verbal knives" into someone.

If you are tired of wading through the lies and attacks here on
Usenet, and you would like to know my real position (on anything),
as opposed to what some with tell you is my position, then you
should either pay attention to what I say (or have said), or you
can ask me.  I'll be happy to detail my TRUE position for you.  :)

If my  memory on chemistry lesson survived the last 7 years, then most gases
produced by garbage don't harm the plastic cart and rarely harmed metals.
Corrosions?  Rubbing alcohol usually cleans them off.  Now if some of the gases
are still present and someone lights up a cigarette, that's another story...

A great drop in Atari bidders at ebay will defiantly occur.  But it's
still possible there won't be that many.  If they are in cement, getting a
lot out would be a lot of long and hard work.  Unless you can sell busted
ETs for $10 each, the expenses of digging up carts just for money is not
high on the list.

If anyone digs up those, it'd be as souvenir of Atari's big botched up
marketing strategy.  ny rare games found in working condition are likely
to be with ruined or missing labels and wouldn't put a dent on the value
of existing games.

Well, having spent lots of time at landfills in Southern California, I can tell
you that the odor and the decomposition of the casings would be greatly
accelerated by being placed in a landfill.  Also, most landfills crush all
their garbage to conserve capacity.  The carts are long gone, get over it.

The point is that unlike other collectibles, there are not more than a few
thousand people collecting classic games actively.  I am a collector in the
sense that I have lots of games and enjoy playing them, and yes along the way I
have accumulated lots of what you would consider to be rares.  Do I think they
have value other than sentimental?  No.  Will I send them to you?  No, unless
you have some kinda museum like Videotopia that is going to make these things
available to the public.  If not, I'd rather keep them here thank you very
much.

 When someone claims they have a collection of "rares" they are guessing
against the possibility that there are thousands of carts sitting in peoples
garages and homes.  Unlike comics or rare books or other more established
collectibles that many people(whether collectors or not) understand have value
and which we have a clearer idea exactly how many are out there, with carts we
have no idea.

If I needed the money, sure I would sell whatever assets I had to make ends
meet.  No doubt.  That doesn't mean that I think there should be a "set" guide
value for my collection.  I would sell stuff for the best offer I got no matter
what the DP or any other guide said.

My frustration is not that I can't afford games anymore but that when a price
guide is issued,  speculators start hording stuff in hopes of making a buck. 
IN the comic world this happened in the mid-1980s.  I had collected from the
early 70s on and had lots of what comic collectors would consider to be rare
books.  I couldn't really even buy comics  during the 1980s because specualtors
jacked up the prices so high that I knew the stuff they were trying to sell
wasn't even worth a quarter of what they claimed it was.  Sure enough, ten
years later it turns out I was right.  However, now that those same comics are
pennies on the dollar, I have no interest because of the bad taste the whole
thing left in my mouth.  I don't want classic cart collecting to take on that
character.

That's my only point.

Bojay

Hey there,

Anyone out there selling an /|\ Jaguar in New Zealand ( or Australia ) ???

Preferably with compatible ( 230 volts AC IIRC ) or an autoswitching p/supply
110-220 volts ( which my Falcon had installed )


In fact, are there any New Zealand Jaguar users here in NZ ??
( Apart from Andre :-)   )


Replies to email if poss.

Cheers,



John E Cash

Sure, but if we put our thrust in someone in this group and we would use it
ourselves. Then it wouldn't matter if someone claimed his or hers list was
better. We just use our list. I don't know who would take on the job, but
it would have to be someone with a lot of experience in dealing on the net.
Just a thought. I have only one name for the bad trader list myself, or
maybe two, but I'd done business with some 30 or 40. My list consist of 26
dealings now, but there was some more guys, but I lost information in a
Win45 ;-) crash

I would put them up there, but need to get info back from them. So, if
anybody is not on my list at : http://home.sol.no/~olavese/index.htm and
feel they should be, please let me know.

Take Atarian care and have an Atarian day

The lies and attacks ended when you quit posting a couple of years ago.
You still haven't explained why you called me a liar on rgvc back then,
or even what I lied about, so now that you're back I'd like to hear it.

Waiting on the new Digital Press guide I suppose...  wouldn't be the
first time you ripped off someone else's work and presented it as your
own.

Oh, on this note...  while I won't bother to detail Mr. Novak's bad
business practices, a factual comparison of two links should show you
what caliber of person you are dealing with:

Novak's 7800 cart prices:
http://www.io.com/~vga2000/fsort/a7800.lst

O'Sheas 80 cent 7800 carts:
http://www.oshealtd.com/

Caveat emptor...  now you have some insight as to why he might have a
bad reputation on a classic videogame newsgroup.

For Trade:

All items perfect mint condition...

* Atari Lynx II with Original Box, Documentation (No scratches anywhere)
* NFL Football w/Docs (Pack-In)
* Ninja Gaiden w/Docs (Pack-In)
* Hard Drivin' w/Docs (Pack-In)
* Batman Returns w/Docs (Pack-In)

Wanted in trade...

Check out what I have @ http://www.sidg.net/fallen/atari/index.html and check
out what I want. If there is something not listed on either list, do make an
offer! I'm basically looking for any games I don't have, with preference to
complete games with box/dox/overlays where applicable. The ones on the wanted
list are just the ones I take preference to. I'm also looking for any
peripherals I may not have, such as a custom arcade joystick and the like or
the ProController. On an odd note, I am also looking for either the Omnibot,
Omnibot 2000, or Robie Sr. robots. Make any offer and I'll be sure to check
it out. As for parting this system out, I'm accepting offers but they will be
the last in consideration, and for the time being, I am not accepting cash
offers. I have a good list of references available upon request as well.
Thanks!

No one knows the answer to this, but I think there are far more than a few
thousand.  There were 23 MILLION VCSs in American households (or was that
worldwide?).  In my travels I've encountered countless modern vid dealers who
now stock old stuff for collectors.

Well, I do show these things to my students every semester--does this count?

How on earth can you say that we have a clear idea (or even a clearer idea)  of
how many June 1964 Jimmy Olsen comics are out there?  Just because we don't
know EXACTLY how many Video Reflex carts are out there doesn't mean we cannot
say for sure that the cart is very rare.  This  point is all very silly and not
worth pursuing.

>meet.  No doubt.  That doesn't mean that I think there should be a "set"
>guide
>value for my collection.

But this was never the point.  The point is that the 30k guy has a collection
for which he can get a huge sum of money, and even though his asking price was
absurd, the very idea sparked a huge amount of animosity, as does the issue of
prices in general.  So I repeat--why is it that prices/values of carts so
upsets people?  I can think of no other reason other than that it makes
collecting more difficult/expensive.  This isn't pleasing to the pure
collector, but it is a fact of life that simply will not go away (at least in
the short run).  And price guides aren't going to hurt matters one way or
another, except that they will inform uninformed people that their carts are
worth something to some people.  Collectors don't welcome that development
either.

< I would sell stuff for the best offer I got no
>matter
>what the DP or any other guide said. 

Of course.  The guide is only a guide.  I would not say it has NO relationship
to the market, but some items will always go for significantly more or less
than whats inthe guide.

I agree with much of what you say here, but look at your own point.  With
comics, high prices meant that you couldn't add to your collection, and the
same thing is happening with carts.  But this was a development that happened
with classic games regardless of price guides.  And it is silly to flame people
like the 30k guy mainly because they understand that their vast collections are
worth vast sums of money to some people.

My final point is that many classic gamers have a schitzy attitude toward
prices and collecting.  If it is really "only" about playing, then what's the
hub-bub?  The best playing games are available for fifty cents each, and why
should any true gamer care that some people will pay $150 for a miserable Chase
the Chuckwagon cart?  All the speculating in the world will not prevent you
from acquiring great playing games.  That is a huge difference with comics. 
There are lots of great comics I could not afford because of price.  Great
baseball cards, too.  I cannot think of many great-playing carts that I cannot
afford because of price.

 What many won't admit is that, once they start collecting, they want more and
more in the way of numbers of carts, and then they run into the price wall for
the crappy ones.  Then they "vent" over prices, price guides, and collectors
like the 30k guy.  If you are going to make the leap into collecting rares, you
are going to run into the price issue.  And also you are going to run into
people who have sunk a couple thousand into their collections of
rares--collectors as well as speculators-- and therefore have a vested interest
in prices.

I am interested in the Lynx Sunvisor, Would you be willing to ship
Postal Serivce? Costing only about 2$ tops.

Also, I need a visor for the First Lynx, NOT the second, is that a
problem?

I may want a game or two, im not sure. I definitely need a visor.

This past weekend, I had the good fortune to find a
Glib cart for a mere $2--and it works no less.
However, I can't figure it out and can't find
instructions anywhere on the Net. Can someone
please fill me in on how to play this game? I'd be
grateful! Please respond to my home email--

Haha... I wonder how many Jag fans are also wrestling fans.  I know Kevin 
Manne is a huge wrestling fan (he says it's his girlfriend who likes it, but 
we all know better), and I still think that Ted Arcidi could beat the heck out 
of most guys around today. ;)

Back onto topic, I hope that 4Play doesn't run into any problems with the 
post-coding part of the process (like IS2 did with the CD encryption 
problems).  I don't know what goes into this process, but I assume there's 
some pretty tricky stuff yet to be done... 

Screw MTV, I want my Battlesphere!

I live in Austin and although I'm a new owner of an Atari 2600, I know several
places that sell various games and equipment for all kinds of systems.  Write
me and I'll let you know.

My guess is he is trying to connect the cable coming out of the 2600 to
one of the inputs on his TV. That won't work, as the VCS(2600) cable
sends an RF signal, not audio or video. Radio Shack sells a 'TV/Game
Switchbox' for around $7 (I think). The VCS RF cable, and your antenna
or cable line plug into the inputs on the switchbox, and the switchbox
attaches to the input on the TV (probably a coax input).

Sorry, I screwed up my last posting to this group.. (yes, this will be my last posting to this news group wrt my auction!)
 
I'm currently auctioning off 19 atari 2600 carts, some with controllers.. None of the auctions have reserves, and most haven't had any bidders yet. Here's your chance. heh

For a list of my auctions, go to:

http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewListedItems&userid=jen@buster.nac.net&include=0&since=-1&sort=2&rows=25

Thanks!
 
long live the fuji.. and all that jazz. =)

Can you be more specific?  My guess is that you aren't using the proper 
switchbox - read the Mini-FAQ on my web site for details.

Good luck...

Ok, here we go, welcome to Bones Classic Carts #5 Auction!  I'd like to
keep
this short and sweet, so here's the down and dirty. I will update via
email and daily and via newsgroups every couple of days.  To be added to
my mailing list, just ask or bid!  Daily updates will continue for 2
weeks until Sunday August 2 when all items go to GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE
FORMAT.   I am moving again (sigh), so I will need to wrap everything up
by August 27th to get your items to you timely.

Shipping is based on actual cost, I can usually get a bunch of carts to
you from anywhere to 2-5 bucks; shipping systems runs a bit higher.  I
ship via good ol USPS and do my best to get it there inexpensively.  Oh
yeah, payment is preferably by money order; just can't move all this
stuff with me!

UNLESS NOTED, MINIMUM BIDS ARE $1.  The bid increments are listed below,
follow
em (: Any bidders with less than $5 in total bids have the option to
drop their bids (it's a shipping thing)  If you would like to be removed
from this mailing, please, just let me know!  Any questions?  Send me a
note!

And of course the usual note about auctions...bid only if you intend to
pay.  Bad bidders get taken off of my mailing list and my list gets
forwarded to other classic game auctioneers.  It's just easier to follow
with your commitments, eh (:

The stuff on my trade list is just for trade right now, in fact
everything is for trade.  If you are interested in trading, just ask for
a copy of my want list!

Minimum Bid increments:
$1-$5   .50 raise
$5-$20  $1 raise
$20-40     $2 raise
$40+  $5 raise

TRADE- the following stuff I would like to trade instead of sell.  I
consider this list the "All-Stars" of my finds, either for their
condition and/or their rarity.
*************
Fairchild System- woo hoo!  I found this sitting with a bunch of old
answering machines and about sod myself.  System comes complete with
console and built in power supply, 2 built in controllers, av cable, and

I would go for a complete port of the OS with processor emulation for
legacy programs.

This upsets me. The Amiga kernel is central to its efficiency and
general behaviour. Using another kernel will make it somwething else
than an AmigaOS.

I'm uncertain, they've stated that they bought Amiga for its
community, and they have previously moved bought user groups to the PC
platform.

I'd say it's neither or a little of both.

If the Amiga can, why not the PC? And how do you know this isn't

I welcome all alternatives, but I want to keep the Amiga alive, and
I'm not sure that Gateway are planning to produce an Amiga.

I bought some VIC-20 carts from VGA last year, he sent them to me in Australia
without a problem. If his price seems steep, there's plenty of noname auctions
to try your luck with on rgvc.

To a newbie, ALL places are 'noname'... to date, I have never had a
problem when
dealing with 'noname' auctions here on rgvc. In fact, I've met more with
more
courtesy when dealing with 'noname' auctions than dealing with actual
retail shops.
All with better prices. All with the possibiltiy of negotitation and
trade. I'm 
glad you had a good experience with VGA... and testimonials like this
help ng readers
decide who to deal with. The addition of that attack on auctions was
unnecessary.

For the record, the only reason I've never bought anything from VGA is
that  
the prices are higher than I'm willing to pay. I also think that the
explantion for 
the pricing is a bit too arrogant... this opinion, on the other hand,
should not
be construed as attack on the integrity of VGA.

If you count the Sears version as well, then there's five of them.
I think the red label version is the rarest.

Well I decided to see how it works.  I have made PDF's of 2 Atari 2600
cart manuals.  They are Defender by Atari and Star Wars - The Empire
Strikes Back by Parker Bros.  You can view these at
http://koltz.marshfield.k12.wi.us.  Click on Atari under consoles and
the Atari 2600 VCS.  Find the above mentioned games listed, and select
the M (for Manual) under Pieces.

I will hopefully get the other manuals online tonight.  I finally
figured out the good working setup for conversion.  Please note, there
may be a few little errors when I converted.  Originally when I
converted, it made each page into a graphic, well for example, the
Defender PDF before I converted it was 30 meg (kinda big), after
conversion was 700k.  What it did was scan through the whole document
to convert the text parts into actual text.  Well it converted some
stuff incorrectly, and I fixed as much as I could, but there are still
a few minor problems.  Nothing really noticeable.

If you have seen the website, I do not have very many manuals for the
2600 or anything else for that matter.  I will scan what I have and
post them.  I only post what I own.  So if people would like to see
more, please email me if you have original manuals (that you have
duplicates of) that I can keep.  I will give credit to the person who
has sent me the manual (if it is wished).  Otherwise, as I get
manuals, I will post them.  I can be emailed at
koltz@marshfield.k12.wi.us.

I will also be getting the Intellevision manuals online hopefully by
this weekend and start working on the ColecoVision manuals that I
have.  If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.

	Rayman's drving me up a wall.  I have it 99% complete, the only
electoon cage left is one in the "Eat at Joe's" level.  I have a guide
to the game, but it's for the PSX version, it says the last cage is on
the last level of the Eat at Joe's world, the one where you jump 
on bouys through the water.  It says that it should appear when I grab
the power-up on the reb stalagtite island in the water, but nothing 
appears.  Where's the last electoon cage?

Read the how to make an alt. newsgroup FAQ, but don't take the point
about alt.config too seriously, while it used to have a purpose for
news admins, it's now only inhabited by about 3 people, all of whom
are mad.

For an alt.newsgroup, you don't need any votes, you can just make one
if you feel there's a need. The alternative is a rec newsgroup, where
you need to win by a 2/3 majority, and with 100 more "yes" than "no"s,
which probably doesn't stand a chance of happening.

well I try my best, to be just like I am
but everybody wants you to be jeeeiiiist like them
they say "sing while you slave", but I just get bored,

I wasn't aware Atari made the N64. Maybe that's why they went out of
business.... :)

I'm hardly a newbie, I've been a sniper on RGVC for a few years now. I have
purchased carts from a few US auctions and had them sent to Australia without
a problem, as well as VGA. A few traders (notably SteveR, who gives good
value) are firm on their prices, but they are known entities. This counts when
you're trading from other side of the world.

For the record, I didn't attack auctions, I attacked the plethora of traders
that pop up on RGVC, with the "Warning: bad trader!" postings that accompany
them.

I feel the same about his prices, the only reason I bought off him was he had
a VIC-20 programmer's reference guide which I wanted, and I decided to tack a
few items on the order. BTW, I found Michael to be polite and prompt with his
correspondence. The only reason I piped up is that he posted legit, and was
flamed unfairly.

	Well, if you're drunk enough you could always cross the boarder
for some small explosive devices.  That is, asuming the carts were only 
covered in concrete, not mixed with it.  (On the other hand, considering
how tough 2600 carts are, maybe they would survive a stick of dynamite...

I wasn't implying you were a newbie, but was thinking of when I first
started
buying over the net.... but I know where you're coming from =)

There HAS been a rush of new traders on the ng...

I know that two people can have vastly different experiences with a
trader... it 
all depends on how you deal with that person, your attitude, mood,
etc... I have 
also added my 2 cents when someone I have traded with is flamed... I'm
glad you
felt you had a positive enough experience to come to MJN's defense... =)

cya!

Yes.  Any universal adapter that puts out 300-500mA at 9V will work.  I
personally use a universal adapter all the time.

The Starpath Supercharger for 2600 had one real hit: Dragonstomper, my personal
favorite equal or better than Adventure.  Activision definitely has the best
replay value on their games still making me play Kaboom to this date. CBS
didn't have to many lame titles either with Tunnel Runner and Omega Race being
two of their more ingenious games.

Me too. You can probably get a universal adapter cheaper, too.

I also use ni-cad batteries for travel - even though officially, you aren't
supposed to, I have been doing it since the Lynx came out with no problems.

I have for auction a lot of 3 games for the Atari ST Computer.  All
games are boxed and shrinkwrapped and in mint cond.  The games are not
new, but have been re-shrinkwrapped.  All games contain the original
disks and relevant materials and are being sold as-is.  The games are
as follows:

         The Running Man - Grandslam, 1989.
         Based on the movie featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger (who is on
the box looking pissed off as usual)...action arcade-style game with
excellent graphics.
         520/1040/2 Meg/4 Meg, Enhancements on 1 Meg drive machines
(written on box)

         Willow - Mindscape, 1988.
         Based on the movie featuring Val Kilmer (I think it was
him??)...adventure/action type game with graphics, sound, etc...
         520 ST/ 1040 ST/ Mega
         Color monitor required

         Captain Fizz Meets the Blaster Trons - Psygnosis, 1988.
         Great cover art, very mysterious looking game...arcade style
game with 22 levels, split screen for simultaneous 2 player action,
etc...  Graphics look awesome!
         2 Joysticks required for 2 players to play

If you are interested in this game, please check it out at ebay -->

Hey gang,
we've been running a "Mystery Game" since April that NO ONE has been able to
guess.  I've had some crazy responses, didn't realize it would be so hard.
Here's a clue that should give it away.

Atari 2600. 20th Century Fox.

I expect a winner within the hour.  Get on it!  Click "mystery game" from
the website below.

Be your bad self.

He wasn't flamed unfairly, I posted factual information.  If you had the
same experience I did with him, you would have probably been less kind. 
Let's just say I decided to stick with the facts instead of getting into
the ugly details of why people shouldn't deal with this guy.  Besides,
when he takes every opportunity to snipe at r.g.v.c. then should we sit
back and pretend everyone here is an ogre and he is the good guy?  I'm
not about to endorse that fairy tale...

I was just wondering if anyone could tell me where I could find an Atari 
shirt for sale...I had seen them on a few web sites a few months ago and 
I can't seem to find them now.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!

	Have to agree with you there(except maybe for the Powerbook), but
i'm not sure if I've played any game for the N64 that would make me buy
it.  I swear if people knew what the Saturn has in terms of imports,
they'd seriously think of it as a contender at least for the best system.
But even though I dislike the PSX, i must say that Twisted Metal 2 was
just a blast to play.  Would I buy a PSX to play it?  Well, no.  But if I
had a PSX, i'd definitely get that.  Only other interesting thing i can
think of is Breath of Fire III.

Well, I just got my first 7800 (Thanks Dan!) and I love it. However, let me
ask this:

Can I use my Atari trackball, and Wico red ball joysticks on it? It seems
that (in a few games anyway) that the two buttons on the 7800 are separate
and when use together will produce different results than just one or the
other by itself. However, the other controllers (trackball and Wico) are
single-button controllers - at least in the sense that each button works the
same as the other...

Thanks!

I saw a copy of Tempest X for the PSX for really cheap. Is it the same as
Tempest 2000 on the Jag? I haven't played anything on the Jaguar except that
crummy Cybermorph. I know the game will probably be sorry on either machine
without a knob controller, but if the PSX one plays the same as the Jag one, I
figure it might be decent. Anyone?

I'm sure this whole debate is less than serious, but just so you know, even if
the carts were dumped in a regular landfill, the surrounding trash would have
begun to decompose generating gasses and other products which would make the
carts unusable.

 A debate on the Citadel network about wheather consoles like the Jag
or Playstation have an OS, or just a bootloader.

I'd like to hear from someone knowledgeable, like a developer.

Yep.  I personally carry my official Atari adapter around in my official
Lynx carry case.  But the universal adapter from Trash Shack under the

True, alot of people have good and bad trader lists on their pages.
Heck, I think there's gotta be over 500  such pages these days, so
what are we supposed to do, go check out ALL of these pages?
An NG would simplify the matter, and make one true place for posting
bad trader info.

Hi,
   I am wondering what a good price for a 2600 is with everything (2
joysticks, and 1 set of paddles, RF, power).  The same goes for an
Intellivision, and a Colecovision.  I am asking because I have seen them
for $19, and i have seen them for $50.  I don;t really care about the
collectors end of it...I just wanna play!!
Please e-mail me with your responses.  brad0112@tc.umn.edu
thanks,

joel

Looking for info on the Atari 1040 stf

I'd like to know what the big difference is between this model
and the 1040st/1040ste is.

Also, what type of serial port does it have? Will I need a special
cable to run any external modem?

Some of this is covered in the Quick FAQ, but the modem part is not, I
don't think.

While Telegames is not the "lowest game in town" I'm sick of seeing them
get a bad rap based on price alone.  If you don't want what they're
offering, don't buy anything.

If you're looking for alot of older and common items, then you can
certainly do better than Telegames if you try.  But when you're talking
about something like IS2 on cart.  They're it.  They're not "gouging"
people really.  If it wasn't for them, the product wouldn't exist.  So
feel free NOT to buy it.

And I'll say this.  While their prices are high, it's a "vertical" product
they often sell.  And my IS2 cart was delivered to me ON TIME and when
promised.  Which is 1000% more than I can say about a certain company who
has had $150 of mine for nearly a year.  And all I have are a bunch of
excuses, AFTER busting ass to get even such a meager response.

But I'll also say this.

If someone is looking to play and enjoy IS2 and is not interested in the
"collectibility" of items.  Then it would be wiser to get a JagCD for $50
and IS2 on CD for $50, as opposed to IS2 cart for $70+.  The VLM alone is
worth the $30 difference, a few times over.  Plus you get the packin
goodies and the option to pick up the few JagCD titles for realtively
cheap.

First of all, if you have the time, I would suggest hitting up your local 
thrift stores and flea markets.  You should be able to find one between 
$1-$15.  If that's something you really don't want to do, I would say $15 for 
a system without games is about right (of course you have to add in shipping). 
 I've seen them for sale for $19 shipped by one regular in r.g.v.c., and I'd 
say that's a fair price, about as good as you'll get.

Good luck!

Let me first say that several weeks ago I politely e-mailed 30k auction guy to
suggest to him that he would not get anything near 30K for his collection.

Having said that, I am amazed (though I shouldn't be) at the venom you guys
spewed over this, and I wonder if your response would have been FUNDAMENTALLY
different if the guy's price had been merely high (20k) or more realistic (say,
12-15k).  How many of you even know exactly what the guy has? Very few of you,
I'll bet.  Yet people have blathered that the guy would be lucky to get $3,000,
his collection isn't worth crap, etc etc.  

Even though the 30k figure is ridiculous, the guy's collection is worth a VAST
sum of money, which only 1 or 2 posters seem to acknowledge.  I think that what
we're seeing here, once again,  is that many/most people here are insanely
angry over the great value of rare carts (thus the stuck-pig sqealing over the
fact that the new DP guide WILL have prices) and so they are furious with this
guy.  Hurts to know that he has a collection that you will NEVER see due to
those damn high prices, huh?

What do you people think the collection IS worth?   A guy shelled out $7,500
for my Atari 2600 collection (and a Johnny-come-lately INSISTED he would have
paid $10,000 after I had sold).  And my collection was significantly less
valuable than the 2600 collection the 30K guy has.  Yes, the 2600 collection is
the core of his offering and I repeat that 30k total is ridiculous.  But I also
repeat that what he has--with the Activision patches, mag collection, complete
CV, Vectrex, etc., is worth a HUGE amount of money, though we may debate how
huge.

One of the guy's main misunderstandings is his belief that somehow the
collection is worth more as a collection than if parted out.  Yet if he parted
it out I would not be shocked if he got close to $15,000 or $20,000. As angry
as it may make you, the guy is not nuts (though his price is unrealistic) and
he is sitting on a gold mine.  I've said it before, I'll say it again: 90% of
those fulminating about cart prices and high-priced collections are people
whose collections are worth squat.

This are the average price I usually find.  Most complete and working 2600 (2
joysticks, paddle, AC adaptor, switch box) for about $10 a set and most games
usually add $1 each to the set price.

Colecovision and Intellivision often starts at $15 a set + $1 per game.

These are justt about the average price I find from most dealers that are not
collectors (like garage sales, thrift shop, or flea market)

If you find anything less than that, it is often a good deal or a lemon.  Check
it out first if you can.

Oh no?!?!

Sure N64 carts cost more.  But the extra $$$ are called insurance.

CD will fail with excessive heat, abuse, tortures, etc.  Carts can handle most
abuses and still work.  Think about it: if you have a 5 year old kid who likes
candy and games.  After his latest visit, your CD may be ruined because it was
left on the floor and trampled all over. Or a half eaten Dum-Dum stuck to the CD
ROM.  Carts can handle a 5 years old and still be playable.

Do you want to spend $60 for a cart that can last 20+ years or blow $20 to
replace ruined game every 6 months? ($800 after 20 years)

Another thing... N64 load game institanously.  CD ROM takes about 2-3 slow
nail-biting nerve-wracking minutes before you can even start the game.  and it's
another minute or 2 before you can actually play it.

'nuff said.

They also turn up in the back of unused drawers.  I've known at least
two people that never had a 2600 (Intelivision folks, mostly) and yet
2600 games pop up in the house every once in a while.

I have the following Jaguar games for trade:

- Power Drive Rally (complete)
- Checkered Flag (complete, box has a crease)
- Cybermorph (unless I decide to do a stress test on it, similar to
              the recent 2600 cart thread.  I think this would be more
	      fun than the actual game is :)


Here are some of the games I'm looking for:

- Club Drive
- Brutal Sports Football
- NBA Jam TE
- AvP (had it before, would like to hear it through my new stereo)

or let me know what other games you have for trade.  

Thanks,

-Matt

  You have no idea how true that is.  I have never owned or played the
7800 and yet I have 5 7800 games floating somewhere in my room.  I can't
remember how I got those in the first place.

OK,
I would think $300 is quite a bit high; I'd even call it ridiculous. But
the fact that everything includes the manuals and boxes should raise the
value a little. I don't know myself what any price guides may say about
the listed stash, but my guess is that the system should fetch around
$35-45 (it does have the manual & the original controllers), and the
games might get around $5 each. Everything is fairly common, but the
boxes and manuals help.

You may get more if you try to sell it on eBay or some other
web-auction.

Telegames IS overpriced and you are either a fool or a die hard collector if
you pay their prices...  Just because someone is "the only game in town" does
not make their "more than its worth" pricing scheme reasonable.  Now go take a

games are boxed and shrinkwrapped and in mint cond.  The games are not
new, but have been re-shrinkwrapped.  All games contain the original
disks and relevant materials and are being sold as-is.  The games are
as follows:

         The Running Man - Grandslam, 1989.
         Based on the movie featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger (who is on
the box looking pissed off as usual)...action arcade-style game with
excellent graphics.
         520/1040/2 Meg/4 Meg, Enhancements on 1 Meg drive machines
(written on box)

         Willow - Mindscape, 1988.
         Based on the movie featuring Val Kilmer (I think it was
him??)...adventure/action type game with graphics, sound, etc...
         520 ST/ 1040 ST/ Mega
         Color monitor required

         Captain Fizz Meets the Blaster Trons - Psygnosis, 1988.
         Great cover art, very mysterious looking game...arcade style
game with 22 levels, split screen for simultaneous 2 player action,
etc...  Graphics look awesome!
         2 Joysticks required for 2 players to play

If you are interested in this game, please check it out at ebay -->

I live in Austin and although I'm a new owner of an Atari 2600, I know several
places that sell various games and equipment for all kinds of systems.  Write
me and I'll let you know.

Andrew sent mine in a reasonable amount of time as well, and was better than I
expected. Its sitting on my shelf now, just as new as it was 10-15 years ago.

I got Power Drive Rally there for $5 or so last summer. There seem to
be 2 or 3 more copies floating around in the local area stores.

hahahahahahahahaha

Why don't I give you $400 and you give me $100??!!?? It would reduce
the shipping cost.

I hate to say it, but anyone who would trade a NEO-GEO CDZ for a
Jaguar would have to be:

A) STUPID
B) CRAZY
C) UNINFORMED
D) ALL OF THE ABOVE

I've seen a JAG system like that go for arond $70 - $90 at local
shops(cheaper on the net). I got my NEO-GEO CD(new) for $300 with 3
games. A CDZ, last I saw, goes for around $300 new itself... If you
can find them. It doesn't add up at all to me. Not to mention the
NEO-GEO isn't dead... they still makes games, not many though, for it.
I think there is one compnay making JAG games - they sell for $60 and
need a CD, which you don't even offer.

If you know how to care for it a CD will last for years (supposedly up
to 100 without abuse, maybe more as that was based on CDs from 10 years
ago or so). If they get scatched a little car wax will do wonders
(especially Zymol that is about $20 a bottle at Wal-Mart, leaves the
car looking nice too). I wouldnt leave it up to kids to care for a CD
system though.

Depends on the reliability of the system and CDs and how well they hold
up with time.

Well their systems are aging, but the 2600s still work (I still have my
original).

As long as the contacts are clean it shouldnt be a problem on a cart
system. A CD system can vary though. Saturns are the most reliable CD
based unit to my knowledge, probably followed by Jag CD then
Playstation.

The Saturn as I said is supposedly highly reliable. If my no name
Electro Brand portable CD player can last over two years the Saturn
will last a lifetime (based on constuction quality).

I would agree. An emulator is likely to be out of the question for the
time being (at least I have not seen one yet). Telegames did not code
IS2, Eclipse did, to get a PC version Eclipse would probably have to do
it. You will be more likely to see another Iron Soldier game on Project
X.

The Jaguar is dead?  There is ONE company making a single CD game??  Stupid, 
crazy, uninformed, or all of the above...

Since Atari's "demise", the Jaguar scene has been extremely active:

Battlesphere has been completed and is awaiting all of the fun 
post-programming stuff (encryption, manufacturing, yadda yadda yadda).

Aircars was published by ICD. Catbox hardware allows networking for this game, 
as well as for Battlesphere (16 player simulataneous).

Telegames (that one company with the $60 CD game you mention) published:
-Towers II
-Zero 5
-Breakout 2000
-Iron Soldier 2 CD
-Iron Soldier 2 Limited Edition cart
-and might be considering some more releases

Gorf 2000 is still being worked on.

The Jag Server has had demo software releases including Jagmania, Jagtris, 
Jagmarble and Native.

I'm forgetting some of the other games that are being worked on (and I might 
have forgotten some of the latest releases... yes, I did... World Tour Racing 
CD, for one).

Now, would you like to tell me about how the Lynx is dead? ;)

Ive noticed recently companies stating they are using S-Playstation at
about 90% or more of its full capabilities. Its progress has been
incredible over the last few years with each new game pushing the system
further along in effects.

My question is this how much do you think of Jaguars true potential has
been left untapped. Could there have been true leaps in quality left
sitting unused. Considering Jag CD never got much support it seems to me
we never got to see Atari at its true performance.
2nd question is which game do you think showed off Jaguars capabilities
best ,not just best gameplay or favorite game.

Are you kidding?  $60 for games for a system that has been essentially dead for
three years?  I could see if they realized the same production costs as other
publishers, but for the most part the games were already complete prior to
being acquired by Telegames.   Not only that, but their shipping and handling
costs are oturageous and they have a restock fee if you decide to return a game
for a refund.

Sure, IS2 is fun but very few of the other new titles seem to be.  My feeling
is that if you really want new Jag games, support efforts to get Hasbro to
either release new games or license them cheap to people in the gamers
community who can distribute them.

no problem, I was not aware that there were other companies other than
telegames making stuff for the JAG. 

Based on what you said : ICD & Telegames are the only two companies
that RELEASED games recently... two companies. A few others are
working / finishing some games. I wouldn't call that EXTREMELY
ACTIVE... Extremely Active would be the PSX, N64 and Saturn in Japan.
I'd call the JAG scene a niche, small companies catering to a small
group of devote people. Hell, even the Vextrex scene has SOME
activity.

Although I like my JAG, and every so often turn it on... I would NOT
trade my NEO-GEO CD for it any day -  much less a CDZ unit!!! That
little NEO unit still impresses me today... surpassing the PSX and
SATURN in 2D gaming. Now if he was offering a JAG & CD with a ton of
games for just a NEO-GEO CD console... if I didn't have a JAG and was
burned out on the NEO, then I might. You'd have to admit a basic JAG
with 4 games and 2 controlers is not much of a trade for a NEO-GEO
CDZ... atleast I hope you would. ;)

BTW : You mentioned Gorf 2000 - is there a release date for that and
who is going to make it?

I bought some VIC-20 carts from VGA last year, he sent them to me in Australia

The latter is true, but the truth is that a lot of the reason for the high
prices _are_ the production costs.  Fortunately, the game binaries
themselves were cheap enough to license, but the part cost for a 4MB game
like IS2 (on cart) is really high.

Now, for the CD games and for Worms which was a 2MB cart but released at a
higher "limited edition" price, yeah, there's a lot more room for profit
in there for them.  Still, it's not like anyone from Telegames will be
retiring early from all that cash coming in from the couple hundred Worms
carts they sold (just a guess on my part on the number).

And BTW, BattleSphere will be a 4MB cart, too... hope no one is expecting
it to sell for $50 or less... same goes for Skyhammer, should it ever be
released.

Actually that is what the original post was about... some guy wanting

Hey, people can dream, right? ;)  It's just like that guy selling his video 
game collection on Ebay for $30000... it'd take a fool to agree to that, but 
the world is full of them.  Considering that you can get a brand new Jag for 
$20 at VGL, that's a pretty good trade... ;)

About your other post (which was quite friendly and sincere... not what I 
usually expect from ANY discussion of video game platforms!) regarding Gorf 
2000... it's being worked on by Steve Scavone and Terrance Williams, aka 
Krunch Force.  They've got their 3D engine complete to a point that they 
released some screenshots of a 3D flagship (these were released quite some 
time ago).  

There is no telling who is going to publish Battlesphere at this point.  It's 
awaiting encryption and production, as I said before, and *possible* problems

The headers are pretty easy.. Find a copy of rfc-977 and read it. I think
it's been obsoleted by a different rfc but it'll get you started.

The chances are pretty slim that you'd actually find out their name/account
but the following header lines point to where you can send complaints:

A very quick look shows that newsread.com is a service provided by Net
Access (netaxs.com) and that their policy clearly states that "spamming
and off-topic news posting is prohibited."

If you believe that this persons postings are off-topic or inappropriate,
you should try sending a short, polite note to postmaster@newsread.com
stating your case. Make sure to forward them the complete (ie, tell your
newsreader that you want all header lines) copy of the offensive post.

Not sure what the reference to Telepath Systems is. The Organization
header is easy to fake so I'd ignore it and go by Message-ID and Path,
both of which can be faked but it's a bit harder.

Don't forget the world's most popular sport... there are two soccer games for 
the Jag.

I guess you wouldn't consider driving an interplanetary space fighter a sport 
(not on THIS crummy planet, anyway), so I won't mention Raiden.

I think no one ever pushed the jag to anywhere near its true potential.
Mostly because games were always behind schedule and Atari needed the
games.  
I have full confidence in the idea that the jag cd could do all the
things the saturn could.

I don't think any of the jag games have showed of any of the Jaguars
capabilities.  Most are like SNES games just better graphics.

That is, until BattleSphere(tm) rolls out... ;)

On the other hand, I decided to write Telegames for the hell of it, and to
show my support for their continuing dedication to the Jaguar. I asked them
about future projects, and they stated the following:

]Date: Tue, 28 Jul 1998 11:26:22 -0500 (CDT)
]From: Telegames <sales@telegames.com>
]To: Sanctuary Internet Design Group <sidg@sidg.net>
]Subject: Re: Atari Jaguar Games
]
]Thank you for your comments and continued interest in Jaguar.  We are
]evaluating our options, but have no "official" release info at this time.
]
]Regards

Nothing new, I guess. God knows what they're thinking, but I'm hoping for 2,
maybe 3 more releases before they call it quits. It'd be admirable of them to
go ahead and finish up the library of games that they do have just so they
are out there for public consumption. What good are the rights to a game
eeprom if you wait ten years to build it? And what good are they if you
*never* build it? If they have the games in stock, the chances are highly
likely that they will be able to sell them eventually for the prices they
currently ask. Besides licensing it to another company for manufacture,
there's really no reason they should just hold the rights and do nothing with
them. And with ICD considering future releases [Post-Battlesphere] more
strongly than ever, you never know. One more may come out that shows off the
Jag one last time before the development stops on a corporate level.

Another idea would be creating a compilation of Jaguar Server games and
burning them onto an EEPROM complete with menu and such, much like an NES
MultiCart. This would be especially effective for those whom a Jaguar
modification would be out of reach. Such cartridges could be produced in
'volumes' [i.e. Volumes 1, 2, 3 with 4+ Homebrew Games on Each] as more
underground development comes into its own.

As an even further aside, does anyone know who owns what rights to whatever
unreleased (and nearly finished or finished) games there are from Atari and
Third-Party Developers?

If all else fails, and Telegames and ICD decide the Jaguar market is no longer
feasible (but then again, if this was the case, neither would be the
ColecoVision or any other system without mainstream support), the Atari Jaguar
Community may end up becoming completely self-sufficient for its future
development possibilities.

Overall, there's a few points to ponder. This makes for ample discussion,
since I hardly ever seem to see anyone mention future development around here
anymore.

I just want more games! ;)

Yesterday I responded to an uncalled for attack within this thread,
asking for info on deciphering the headers in the distasteful post.
While I can figure out some of the info, I was hoping I could find more
info with help.

Well, several people responded and gave me more useful information, as
well as guidance toward finding more through a little research.

Many thanks to everybody who gave me some help. And rest assured I have
forwarded the brilliant writing of our sort-of-anonymous colleague to
the postmaster at my ISP, as well as at what I believe to be his ISP.

See you guys and gals at JagFest!

Steve

Is there an website for Gorf 2000?

Also... is there a developement kit for the JAG? I haven't done any
serious programming for about 10 years, but I would think a JAG kit
would be cheap enough to play around with.

Okay, we usually take it for granted that a game with box and
instructions is worth more than a loose cart, and a new shrinkwrapped
game is worth even more. My question is this:

Let's do a hypothetical here:

I have one copy of Battlesphere 3000 3D, Minter edition (Hey, I said
hypothetical, didn't I?) and I am selling it for $60, the current
going price for the game, judging by the current NG postings, and the
fact that it is new/shrinkwrapped. Now, how much would I theoretically
charge if:

The shrinkwrap is open, but still present?
(Loose an automatic $10 here?)

The above plus the game baggy is missing?
(Not too important, since the game is open anyway)

The above plus no instruction manual?
(Knock another $10 off?)

The above plus no box?
(Maybe down to $30 now?)

I just want to get some opinions here. This could also apply to any
game, cart or CD. Up until recently, about 90% of my Jag cart
purchases have been with box and instructions, so I guess I'm just
curious. I see some people selling hard to find loose Jag carts for
alot less than I would expect to see, some alot more than I expect.

Has anyone tried to persuade Jeff Minter to write another Jaguar game? He
used to make shareware games in the past and although he's currently tied up
with Project X he sure knows how to code the beast. If someone has the
potential to come up with another killer game it's the YaK!

Probably quite a bit. Better developers kits probably would have helped

I think there was more potential than what was seen in most games to
date.

The Jag CD probably would have only showed more in FMV capability and
depth due to storage potential.

>2nd question is which game do you think showed off Jaguars

>best ,not just best gameplay or favorite game.
>
There are more games out there than one that showed promise and
capabilities, my list is Iron Soldier 1&2, Fight For Life, Hover Strike
CD, Tempest 2000, Rayman, Doom, and Wolfenstien. These games showed
some of the Jaguar's power. IS1&2 prove Polygons can be done at 30fps
with some texture mapping on the Jag. Fight For Life proves higher
resolution textures can be done at a reasonable frame rate and prove
that Jag can do something around 40,000 tmapped polys a second.
Hoversrike CD proves texture mapping and lighting effects can be done
well enough. Tempest 2000 shows us particle effects and unique color
effects. Rayman shows us a platformer can be done that looks good with
many colors. Doom proves the Jag can do a first person shooter in 16
bit color, PC Doom ran at 256 colors (8 bit color). Wolfenstein proved
that the Jaguar could do it fast with its 60FPS. If you want to count
it, the VLM showed that Jaguar's color pixel and sprite ability.

IS2 is one of the few released titles that probably had enough merit to
warrant the release. It must have sold enough or produced enough demand
because otherwise they never would have produced the cart version. IS2
is a Jaguar masterpiece IMO, an excellent game. I could play it for an
hour and not be bored (maybe frustrated).

Battlesphere and Skyhammer would probably warrant sufficient demand to
make them worthwhile at $60 or so, as was IS2, but something like Worms
for $70 (plus all the shipping) when I could have it for $10 on
Playstation or something does not seem worth it. Skyhammer,
Battlesphere and IS2 are and probably will remain Jaguar exclusives
(assuming if Eclipse does another IS game for Project X it would be
different).

Right, we should all just accept any crappy policy or level of customer service
we are blessed with, right?  If you don't think Telegames is overpriced, maybe
you should look at their other price lists.  There is nothing they sell that
can't had be cheaper elsewhere, including their Jag exclusive titles which are
sold at the same price but without the excessive shipping and handling costs by
other dealers.

Hasn't somebody found a way to hack a Nomad so it can play 2600 carts yet? I'd
gladly pay for another Nomad, and for the service. I know I'm not the only one
who would love a 2600 handheld...

Unless other dealers have recently changed their pricing structure,
Telegames is the best deal on the Jag exclusive titles from Telegames.
This wasn't always true, however.

A few months ago, though, Telegames dropped the prices on B2K, Z5, WTR,
and IS2 CD by $10 to only $49.95.  Every other dealer I've seen still
lists them at $59.95.

Plus, when I ordered Worms from Telegames, I applied a $10 coupon to Z5
making it only $39.95.  So, for under $120 _including shipping_, I
purchased Worms and Zero 5.  Not a bad deal in my book.

Yes, I do know that Telegames often has high prices, but most of the new
games except Towers II and Worms are really priced fairly IMHO.  And I'm
still glad that I purchased Towers II and Worms anyway.

There is, but Wes Powell's Jagu-Dome (http://jaguar.holyoak.com) has 
the most information about it.  There is an interview with Steve located at: 
http://jaguar.holyoak.com/gorfpre.html
and a more update preview (with screenshots of his 3D stuff) at:
http://jaguar.holyoak.com/gorfpreview.html

The official page is at: http://www.intac.com/~krunch/index.html

Yes, there is a dev kit for the Jag. According to Steve's interview, the kit 
is under $300.  

http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/1460/dox.html     
Jaguar Hacking Docs are located at this site.

You'll also want to check out this if you get seriously into it: 
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/1460/ugd.html

I believe that Steve reads this newsgroup (rec.games.video.atari) so you might 
be able to contact him here.  The members of 4Play also read this newsgroup, 
and they've just finished their game, so they could probably point you in the 
right direction.

     They are both on the endangered list, true.  They'll be back though. 
Isnt that the point of the list?  

      Ive had my Jaguar and Lynx for almost two years now.  I picked up the
Jaguar with three games for $49.00,  now i see i can get the sega saturn
for $49.00 with no games.  Will i, no.  I rather spend my money on Atari. 
All the people who make fun of the library of games such as Club Drive of 
Dragon :Bruce Lee .   Have never played them, even though the graphics on
Club Drive arent like Ridge Racer, they are still very 
Cool.  And it, in my opinion, is one of the most fun games the Jaguar has
to offer.  But there is so much more Skiing and Snowboarding, and the much
anticipated BattleSphere!
  Apple made its way back, so its inevitable that Atari will too! : )

  Thanks for your time

Andy

It all depends on what your going to use it for.  If just for video and
audio it isn't worth it at all you could make those yourself or buy the
cables.  If just to connect to another jag it isn't worth it either. 
Get a jag-link instead (I got mine for a dollar).  But if you want to
connect to several jags and want the video and audio connections then
it is worth it.

2600 was the first system, and the most popular Atari system.  5200 came out a few
years later.  It could play the 2600 games with a hard to find adaptor.  The
problem is sonme older 5200 system can't use the adaptor.  If you get a 5200, get
a 2 port version.  They are almost guarranted to work with 2600 games

The 7800 came out in the latter part of the '80 and can play the 2600 games
directly w/o an adaptor.  But many of the 7800 games sucks.  Also there is an
adaptor for the 7800 to play the 5200 games but it wasn't mass produced or
released so you have an extremely hard to find prototype to find.

If I were starting out in Atari games, I'd stick with the 2600.  Plenety of good
games.  Over 1000 titles available.  Also many good games and system are like
dime-a-dozen commons.

Add me to the hack's mailing list.  I know of many stores that offers new NoMad
system for under $40 and I'd love to drive people crazy by plaing Yars Revenge
on a Genesis portable system.  I'd just have to find an easy way to carry all
that games (200+) w/o breaking my back.

Yes, you can play 2600 games on a 7800.  People will tell you that certain 
games will not work, but that is a *very* rare occurrence that only exists 
with certain models, I wouldn't worry about it.  The only thing you would have 
a problem with are Tigervision games.  The cases are physically too large to 
fit in the 7800 slot, otherwise they are fine.  You cannot play 7800 games on 
a 2600.

The 5200 is not compatible on it's own with anything.  You can get a system 
changer to play 2600 games on it, but it's very hard to find and somewhat 
expensive on the collector market.

I recommend a 7800.

7800 can play 2600 games with no adapter needed but can not play 5200.
5200 can play 2600 with the hard to find adapter but not 7800 .2600 can
play 2600 only.
2600 easy to find,7800 harder to find ,5200 hardest to find plus the
adapter is another toughy. Best bet 7800 if you only want 1 system but
use 2600 controlers it will become apparent soon after you get it. : )

I've had one on order since August 1997. I'm still waiting for ICD to ship
it. If I'm still alive by the time it arrives at my house, then I'll tell
you if it's worth it.

Hey, Sal!  I got a phone call today from Tom with ICD.   He said the Catboxes
should be shipping in August.  He couldn't be any more specific than that,
unfortunately.  I don't know if this is helpful at all, but I thought I would
pass it along.

Ignoring the fact that the foregoing was an off-topic spam post, has
anyone thought about a videogame web cam?  Wonder if that would fly...

The cases are not too large.  The carts have 2 1" or so prongs placed on
either side of the ROM connector.  These prongs will not line up properly
with the cartridge slot on the 7800.  If you snap these 2 prongs off, they
will play perfectly fine on the 7800.  They become just like any of the other
bare ROM connector carts (like Parker Bros.).

Hey Jason... Tom's been telling me that since Decemeber 1997. Don't hold your

This is probably contrary to the advice you would get from most people
here...  get the 7800, it works with the 2600 sticks and virtually all
2600 games (and usually all that you would want to play anyway.)  And
the 7800 had a lot of great games as well (I can think of more 5200
games that sucked...)

Also, the 5200 cannot play 2600 games.  The adapter it uses requires
2600 controllers and is just a small 2600 system that plugs into the
5200.  The 7800 uses 2600 compatible controllers already so you don't
have to go out and buy a bunch of hard to find hardware to get up and
running.

Ooops, you're right, I plead temporary confusion!  I basically meant to say 
"you cannot play them without altering the physical case".  I would never be 
able to snap the prongs off my Tigervision games, and would never suggest to 
another to do so.  Blasphemy!  ;)

Just keep a spare 2600 around for those Tigervision carts....

Hi,

  >ok, I know this is a stupid question, but is there any compatability between
  >the systems?...

Some, the 7800 will play most 2600 games - they plug straight in - asd it has a
2600 compatibility mode built in.

The 5200 AFAIK isn't compatible with in any way with the 2600/7800 as it's
basically an Atari 400/800 computer without a keyboard (it has had the
addresses of Pokey/Antic/GTIA moved though so you can't play standard carts on
it though - I hacked a couple of 5200 games so they'd play on the Atari 800
many many moons ago).

I've heard rumours of a 2600 adapter for the 5200, but from what I can find out
it's basically a 2600 which plugs into the 5200's cartridge port so....


  >....play 2600 games on the 7800?... if anyone could help me out with this, I
would
  >really appreciate it... thanks everyone!

Get a 7800.

Don't forget Alien vs Predator.  Another 1st person shooter with
higher res and more colors than Doom. (I'm not sure though)

   Look around the net - there are dozens of different models of the 2600. Some
are  scare and go for over $80. Now you can think that is over-priced, however,
from a collecting view-point it is a totally different matter. When you go to
buy your first car when you are a teenager you don't buy a Mint-Condition Model
A (very slow, yes). It would get you from point A to point B but you don't need
a model A. You need a little used Toyota Pickup - etc.

  You have no idea how true that is.  I have never owned or played the
7800 and yet I have 5 7800 games floating somewhere in my room.  I can't
remember how I got those in the first place.

ULM is a periodic feature that will be posted to alt.games.lynx and
rec.games.video.atari.  The purpose is to generate some interest and
discussion around the Atari Lynx portable video game system, especially
for game titles that have been "under-exposed" on the internet.  

Contact forhan@millcomm.com for information on contributing to ULM.

| Shanghai                   |
\____________________________/

It's no wonder that Shanghai is consistently ranked among the best games
available for the Lynx.  Activision (under the name Mediagenic) took a
completely simplistic and timeless game of removing matching pairs of
tiles, and delivered a first-rate adaptation for Lynx fans.

One common problem with handheld systems is, naturally, the small size of
the screen.  For Shanghai, it's vital that the tiles be clearly
identifiable for the sake of finding matching pairs.  Not only are the
colors and numbers easily recognized on those tiny tiles, there's a
"zoomed in" view of the current tile in the corner of the screen.  The
player object (an arrow) is likewise easy to distinguish and move about
the screen.

Sounds and music are a true pleasure in this game.  Very few other Lynx
games boast the ability for the player to select one of four tunes (or
silence) during the game!  Each tune features several voices, reflects
a unique style, and is long enough to not wear on the player's nerves
after the first 30 seconds.

You say you want options?  Shanghai supports seven different tile
configurations, in-game help and even built-in instructions on how to
play.  Even the tile graphics are selectable.

And a truly special treat is the comlynxed play modes.  Now, Shanghai is a
wonderful game that will keep you busy for many hours of play even by
yourself.  But the two-player modes (Alternating Competitive, Simultaneous
Competitive, or Cooperative) really shine in this game.  

In the Alternating Competitive mode, each player only has 10 seconds to
find a match.  After that, control switches to the other player.  This
makes the game really nerve-wracking but exciting!  Whoever removes the
most pairs by the end of the game wins. 

Likewise, in the Simultaneous Competitive mode, you want to make as many
matches as possible, but this time you don't have to take turns.  You can
even steal an opponent's tile by selecting a matching tile!  The
Cooperative mode is also present for players who want just a laid back
multiplayer game.

Strategy Tips: 

1) Don't take the easy, outer perimeter matches first.  Try to find
   matches that will reveal underlying tiles or else you'll find yourself
   stranded later in the game. 
2) Some of the configurations are easier, because the tiles are spread out
   across the playfield more than they are stacked up.  The Spider is a
   good puzzle for newcomers to the game.
3) If you think you have nothing left to learn on Shanghai since you have
   no one to comlynx with, how fast can you beat the Dragon? :-)

I'll believe them when I see them (I ordered two).  But I tell you.  Even
when they do show up...I have a gut feeling that they will not arrive with
the extra cables and such I am supposed to get for ordering more than
one...

I'm quite new to collecting 2600 carts, and I was thinking about one of my
childhood favorites--Montezuma's Revenge.  I haven't seen this listed in any lists
in the past few weeks, and I was wondering--how rare is it?

While I'm at it, I'll throw out my 2600 URL:
http://www.circle.net/tetryl/2600.html
....not much there yet, but you have to start somewhere, right?  I have a [VERY]
short list of 2600, C=64, NES, and VIC-20 stuff that I have available for
trade/sale.

As far as I know, there are no known prototypes fo any 5200-to-7800 or
7800-to-5200 adapters. I think a 7800-to-5200 adapter was discussed, but
there is no indication one was ever built.

And btw, I happen to like a lot of 7800 games, especially the early
arcade translations.   :)

It's somewhat rare (and a great game).  Keep looking and you can probably pick 
one up for $10-$15.

Good luck!

Updates since the last publicly posted FAQ have a percent sign (%) in the
first column.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What was the Atari Jaguar/Jaguar64?
 
A. The Atari Jaguar was the world's first 64-bit home console video game
   system.  Developed after three years of research, manufactured by IBM, the
   Jaguar was released in Fall 1994, and offered high-speed action, CD-quality
   sound, and polygon graphics processing beyond most other machines available
   at the time.

   Orignally released as the Jaguar, Atari had, at times, referred to the
   machine as the "Jaguar64" for marketing purposes.  For the sake of
   simplicity in this document, the term "Jaguar" will be used.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What was included when you bought a Jaguar?
 
A. The Jaguar was first sold for $250.  It came with the Jaguar itself, one
   controller, an AC adapter, a television RF switch box, and the CYBERMORPH
   video game.  Later on, the Jaguar was sold without a game, and as time
   progressed, the Jaguar was sold for $150, then $99.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What happened to Atari, anyway?
 
A. The trials and tribulations of Atari could fill a small book (and, in fact,
   once did).  To summarize VERY briefly, the history of Atari is as follows:
 
     1972   Atari Inc. founded by Nolan Bushnell from a $250 investment.
              Pong arcade game becomes a smash sensation.
     1976   Atari Inc. sold by Bushnell to Warner Inc. for $28 million.
     1980   Atari Inc. posts record sales.  $2 billion profits annually.
              Atari occupies 80 offices in Sunnyvale, CA.
     1983   Decline of video games and irresponsible spending by Atari Inc.
              results in record losses ($536 million, up to $2 million daily).
     1984   Warner divides Atari Inc.  Home division (Atari Corp.) is sold to
              Jack Tramiel.
     1985   Atari Corp. releases Atari ST home computer.
     1989   Atari Corp. releases Atari Lynx, the world's first color hand-held
              video game system (see the Atari Lynx FAQ).
     1993   Atari Games becomes Time-Warner Interactive.
     1993   Atari Corp. releases Atari Jaguar, the world's first 64-bit home
              video game system.
     1996   Time-Warner Interactive (Atari Games) sold to WMS.
     1996   Atari Corp. announces reverse merger with JTS Corporation.
     1996   Atari Corp. and JTS connsumate deal on July 31 1996.
     1998   Hasbro acquires the rights to Atari Corp.'s name and properties

==============================================================================
 
Q. What was IBM's role in the Jaguar?
 
A. IBM had a $500 million contract with Atari Corp. to assemble, test,
   package, and distribute Jaguar units.  Manufacturing was done at IBM's
   Charlotte, NC facility, and the Jaguar was IBM's first attempt at producing
   a consumer-grade product for an outside vendor.  By mid-1994, Jaguar units
   were also manufactured by Comptronix in Colorado Springs.
 
   Jaguar circuit boards were manufactured and assembled by an IBM
   subcontractor; IBM then cased, tested, and packaged final Jaguar units,
   which were then sent to Atari.  IBM had no participation in the actual
   design of the Jaguar chipset.

==============================================================================

Q. Okay, who did design the Jaguar?

A. The primary designers of the Jaguar were Martin Brennan and John Mathieson.
   They started their own company in 1986 called Flare 1, and designed an
   original multiprocessor game console.  After the system was finished, Flare
   wanted to "evolve" the system, but needed funding for the job.  Atari was
   contacted, believed in the idea, and agreed to participate.  Atari,
   Brennan, and Mathieson started a new company called Flare 2 to develop the
   system. As Jaguar development moved along, it became apparent that the
   machine would leapfrog the then-new systems from Nintendo and Sega (the
   Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, respectively), so they decided to bring
   the machine to light.  The entire process took three years, from initial
   design to production-ready models.

   The proprietary Jaguar chipsets were manufactured by Toshiba and Motorola.

==============================================================================

Q. What are the specifications of the Jaguar?

A. Physical dimensions:

       Size: 9.5" x 10" x 2.5"
   Controls: Power on/off
    Display: Programmable screen resolution.  Horizontal resolution is
               dependent on the amount of scanline buffer space given to the
               "Tom" graphics processor.  Maximum vertical resolution varies
               according to the refresh rate (NTSC or PAL).  Reportedly, a
               stock Jaguar (without additional memory) running NTSC can
               display up to 576 rows of pixels.
             24-bit "True Color" display with 16,777,216 colors
               simultaneously (additional 8 bits of supplimental graphics
               data support possible)
             Multiple-resolution, multiple-color depth objects (monochrome,
               2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit) can be used
               simultaneously
      Ports: Cartridge slot/expansion port (32 bits)
             RF video output
             Video edge connector (video/audio output)
               (supports NTSC and PAL; provides S-Video, Composite, RGB
               outputs, accessible by optional add-on connector)
             Two controller ports
             Digital Signal Processor port (includes high-speed synchronous
               serial input/output)
Controllers: Eight-directional joypad
             Size 6.25" x 5" x 1.6", cord 7 feet
             Three fire buttons (A, B, C)
             Pause and Option buttons
             12-key keypad (accepts game-specific overlays)

  The Jaguar has five processors which are contained in three chips.  Two of
  the chips are proprietary designs, nicknamed "Tom" and "Jerry".  The third
  chip is a standard Motorola 68000, and used as a coprocessor.  Tom and
  Jerry are built using an 0.5 micron silicon process.  With proper
  programming, all five processors can run in parallel.

   Communication is performed with a high speed 64-bit data bus, rated at
   106.364 megabytes/second.  The 68000 is only able to access 16 bits of this
   bus at a time.

   The Jaguar contains two megabytes (16 megabits) of fast page-mode DRAM,
   in four chips with 512 K each.  Game cartridges can support up to six
   megabytes (48 megabits) of information, and can contain an EEPROM
   (electrically erasable/programmable read-only memory) chip to save game
   information and settings.  Up to 100,000 writes can be performed with the
   EEPROM; after that, future writes may not be saved (performance varies
   widely, but 100,000 is a guaranteed minimum).  Depending on use, this limit
   should take from 10 to 50 years to reach.

   The Jaguar uses 24-bit addressing, and is reportedly capable of accessing
   data as follows:

           Six megabytes cartridge ROM
           Eight megabytes DRAM
           Two megabytes miscellaneous/expansion

   All of the processors can access the main DRAM memory area directly.  The
   Digital Signal Processor and the Graphics Processor can execute code out of
   either their internal caches, or out of main memory.  The only limitations
   are that

   (1) "jump" instructions in main memory have certain restrictions; the JMP
         (unconditional jump) command is longword-aligned, while the JR
         (jump-indexed-by-register) command must be either word- or longword-
         aligned.  And
   (2) running out of the cache is much faster (up to four times faster) and
         efficient.

   Some believe that the inability to jump/branch in main memory makes the
   main memory feature useless.

   Swapping data between the caches and the main memory is a quick, low
   overhead operation, and therefore the main memory is often used as "swap
   space" for cache code.  The RISC compiler included in the latest Jaguar
   developer's kit produced code that transparently swaps code through the
   cache.  This effectively allowed developers write RISC code without concern
   for the cache size limits.

   Compressed cartridge data can be uncompressed in real-time, and ratios of
   up to 14:1 have been cited.  In theory, a Jaguar cartridge can store up to
   84 megabytes (672 megabits) of data, though actual results will vary
   widely (most often, images are compressed, while sound and code are not).
   Compression is performed with BPEG, an enhanced JPEG image decompression
   mechanism.  BPEG supercedes the former JagPEG algorithm, working up to 10
   times faster and with more flexibility.

   Other Jaguar features:
   - Support for ComLynx I/O for communications with the Atari Lynx hand-held
       game system and networked multiconsole games (on DSP port, accessible
       by optional add-on connector).  Networking of up to 32 Jaguar units
       available.
   - The two controller ports can be expanded to support "dozens" of
     controllers
     - Digital and analog interfaces
     - Keyboards, mice, and light guns are possible
   - Expansion port allows connection to cable TV and other networks
   - Digital Signal Processor port allows connection to modems and digital
     audio peripherals (such as DAT players)
   - One megabyte per second serial interface
   - 9600 baud, RS-232 serial port (accessible with optional interface)
   - General-purpose I/O bits via the cartridge port
   - Can accomodate future expansions of different processor types, I/O types,
       video types, and memory types and/or quantities.

==============================================================================
 
Q. Was the Jaguar really a 64-bit system?
 
A. The question is hard to resolve, largely because the definition of what
   constitutes an "N-bit" system has not been set.  Of the five processors in
   the Jaguar, only the object processor and the blitter are "true" 64-bit
   components.  Because the blitter and the object processor are in the Tom
   chip, by extension Tom is a 64-bit chip.  Furthermore, the Jaguar also used
   a 64-bit memory architecture, according to Jez San of Argonaut Software.

   Some say the Jaguar should be considered a 32-bit system, as that is the
   maximum register size in the programmable processors (the 68000, the
   graphics processor, and the DMA sound processor).  Others say the Jaguar
   can be considered a 64-bit system, because 64-bit components are used, and
   the GPU can access 64 bits of data if required.  Again, the lack of an
   agreed-upon definition serves to complicate the issue.

   According to Jaguar designer John Mathieson, "Jaguar has a 64-bit memory
   interface to get a high bandwidth out of cheap DRAM. ... Where the system
   needs to be 64 bit then it is 64 bit, so the Object Processor, which takes
   data from DRAM and builds the display is 64 bit; and the blitter, which
   does all the 3D rendering, screen clearing, and pixel shuffling, is 64 bit.
   Where the system does not need to be 64 bit, it isn't.  There is no point
   in a 64 bit address space in a games console!  3D calculations and audio
   processing do not generally use 64-bit numbers, so there would be no
   advantage to 64 bit processors for this.

   "Jaguar has the data shifting power of a 64 bit system, which is what
   matters for games, so can reasonably be considered a 64 bit system.  But
   that doesn't mean it has to be 64 bits throughout."

   For the record, the opinion of most third party developers and observers
   is that the Jaguar is indeed a 64-bit system.  The emphasis is on the word
   "system"; while not every component is 64 bits, the Jaguar architecture, as
   a COMPLETE SYSTEM, is.

==============================================================================
 
Q. The Jaguar used a 68000.  Isn't that the CPU?
 
A. Again, quoting from Jaguar designer John Mathieson, "It may be the CPU in
   the sense that it's the centre of operation, and boot-straps the machine,
   and starts everything else going; however, it is not the centre of Jaguar's
   power. ... The 68000 is like a manager who does no real work, but tells
   everybody else what to do."

   And...

   "Atari were keen to use a 68K family device, and we looked closely at
   various members.  We did actually build a couple of 68030 versions of the
   early beta developers systems, and for a while were going to use a 68020.
   However, this turned out too expensive.  We also considered the possibility
   of no [Motorola 680x0 chip] at all.  I always felt it was important to have
   some normal processor, to give developers a warm feeling when they start.
   The 68K is inexpensive and does that job well.  I maintain that it's only
   there to read the joysticks."

==============================================================================
 
Q. How could a graphics processor be the CPU?
 
A. The 64-bit custom graphics chip was a good general purpose RISC unit, but
   it had been optimized for graphics work.  Developers were free to specify
   which processor(s) to use in a program, as desired.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What kind of special effects could the Jaguar do?
 
A. The Jaguar was capable of doing the following visual effects:
 
   - High-speed scrolling (Object Processor).
   - Texture mapping on two- and three-dimensional objects (GPU and Blitter).
   - Morphing one object into another object (GPU).
   - Scaling, rotation, distortion, and skewing of sprites and images
       (Object Processor).
   - Lighting and shading from single and multiple light sources (GPU and
       Blitter).
   - Transparency (Object Processor).
   - "Rendering" up to 850 million one-bit pixels/second (35 million 24-bit
       pixels/second, 26 million 32-bit pixels/second), or 50 million Goroud
       shaded pixels/second.  "Rendering" is believed to mean transferring a
       pixel from a frame buffer to the screen.
   - Sprites of "unlimited" size and quantity.  Realistically, sprites can be
       over 1,000 pixels wide/tall, and the number of sprites allowed is
       limited by processor cycles instead of a fixed value in hardware
       (Object processor).
   - Programmable screen resolutions, from 160 to 800 pixels per line.  The
       resolution can be increased even further with additional hardware up to
       a reported 1350 pixels per line.

   One of the Jaguar modes is called "CRY mode", which supports lighting and
   effects in 3D graphics.  Red, green, and blue color elements are ranged
   from 0 to 255, and the lighting level for any pixel can be changed by
   setting one byte linearly.  E.g., the relative proportions of red, blue,
   and green are indicated with one byte, while a second byte selects an
   overall intensity of 0 to 255.  CRY allows much smoother shading of single
   colors, but doesn't allow blending between colors as smoothly.

   Actual graphics performance is hard to measure, as there are no industry-
   standard benchmarks.  Rebellion Software has claimed that the Jaguar can
   render "10,000 Gourard shaded, large, 65536 color, any shape polygons per
   second," while still performing other tasks.  Presumably this level can
   be increased further with optimized programming; indeed, some unofficial
   calculations speculate that FIGHT FOR LIFE may generate between 20,000 to
   40,000 texture-mapped polygons per second.

   A key to understanding the Jaguar's performance is to realize that most
   effects are accomplished by programming one of the processors to do the
   job.  To perform texture-mapping, for instance, required a developer to
   write a texture-mapping routine for the GPU and/or blitter, then call it
   as needed.  The general-purpose nature of the Jaguar architecture gave
   developers a lot of flexibility; unfortunately, the drawback was that
   software routines for such effects are invariably slower and less efficient
   than dedicated hardware chips and components.

==============================================================================
 
Q. How come the Jaguar claims to have "32-bit" graphics, when only 24 bits are
   needed to render 16 million colors?
 
A. The additional 8-bits was for programmers to implement whatever visual
   effects might be desired.  Examples cited include Z-buffering (for polygon
   graphics) and an alpha channel (for transparency).

==============================================================================
 
Q. Who were the third-party publishers/developers for the Jaguar?
 
A. The following companies have, at one time or another, been announced as
   official developers, licensees, or publishers for the Jaguar.  Note that
   an official announcement was not an obligation for a company to produce
   Jaguar-related products; many times, it merely meant that the company made
   a commitment to "consider" producing product(s) for Atari.

   Also, Time-Warner Interactive had licensed the Jaguar architecture for
   use in arcade games.  The "CoJag" architecture was a Jaguar chipset with
   more memory, a hard drive, and other architectural changes.  Two CoJag
   games have been released:
 
   * Area 51: A light-gun shooting game for two players.  The Jaguar's 68000
     was replaced with a 68020 or SGI R3K, and ran at 25 MHz.  It was also
     equipped with a four megabytes of RAM and a one gigabyte hard drive.
 
   * Maximum Force: Another light-gun shooting game.  The 68000 was replaced
     with an SGI R3K, and came with six megabytes of RAM and a two gigabyte
     hard drive.

Q. What were the unreleased Jaguar games?
 
A: The following games were announced at one time or another as being planned
   for the Jaguar.  With the dissolution of Atari, the chances are very slim
   that any of these games will ever be produced or released.  However, a few
   enterprising companies and individuals have considered plans to either
   finish their Jaguar titles for release, to sell finished-but-unreleased
   games, or to produce new games on their own.

Q. Where can I get a review and/or comments about <insert game name here>?
 
A: Robert A. Jung (rjung@netcom.com) has reviews of some Jaguar games and
   peripherals.  They are available on the world-wide web at his web site,
   at http://www.digiserve.com/eescape/atari/Atari.shtml

==============================================================================
 
Q. Where can I find secrets, tips, and hints for <insert game name here>?
 
A. A comprehensive list of Jaguar cheats and codes is available from "The
   Mage," at http://users.aol.com/TheMage1/jaguar/jagcodes.txt or
   http://members.aol.com/TheMage1/jaguar/jagcodes.txt

   Clay Halliwell maintains the Atari Jaguar Cheats and Codes FAQ, which he
   updates regularly.  It can be found on the world-wide web at
   http://www.magicalfox.com/ken/jagcheat.txt, or write to him at
   e.halliwell@genie.com

==============================================================================
 
Q. Some of my Jaguar games don't have overlays for the keypads.  Where can I
   get them?
 
A. Not all Jaguar games used overlays for the keypad; some titles didn't use
   the keypad at all, while others used the keypad, but the developers did not
   feel that an overlay was needed.  Making your own keypads is certainly
   possible; simply use an existing keypad for a template, draw whatever
   designs you like, then cut and to fit.
 
   Tony Price has made a number of overlays for Jaguar games that didn't
   include them, as well as dust covers for the keypads.  He can be reached by
   mail at mfmurdock@earthlink.net, or on the world-wide web at
   http://home.earthlink.net/~mfmurdock/jaguar/jaguar.htm
 
==============================================================================
 
Q. What Jaguar peripherals are available?
 
A: The following Jaguar-related peripherals were released.  Availability will
   vary according to source:

   * Atari Corp.

     Sunnyvale, CA  94089-1302

       Jaguar to play Jaguar CD games.  See the dedicated entry for details.

       designed/optimized for the Pro Controller (PRIMAL RAGE, HIGHLANDER,
       SUPER BURNOUT, ATARI KARTS, and BATTLEMORPH are the most notable ones);
       other titles, while not specifically written for the Pro Controller,

       available from local FSN service providers.

==============================================================================

Q. What's the information on the CD-ROM drive?

A. A double-speed CD-ROM drive was available.  The CD drive has an access time
   of 210 milliseconds, and has a sustained data transfer rate of 352.8K per
   second.  The CD-ROM drive features a modified data bus interface for access
   to the Tom and Jerry chips almost directly, allowing for a higher
   throughput rate on sound and graphics.  Storage on a disc is approximately
   790 megabytes (6,320 megabits).  The CD-ROM drive plugs into the Jaguar's
   cartridge slot.  A pass-through cartridge slot allows cartridges to be used
   with the CD-ROM attached.  Separate memory cartridges allow Jaguar CD games
   to be saved for later play.

   The Jaguar CD format is a non-standard format that is not compatable with
   the ISO-9660 standard.  It uses audio-format sectors for data, which allows
   for 2352 bytes of useable space in each sector.  Unfortunately, this leaves
   no provision for error correction or file system management (though errors
   are detected by the CD drive hardware).  Each disc is copy-protected with
   encrypted data that is specially formatted to look like an error.  Attempts
   to copy a Jaguar CD will fail because it cannot read the encrypted data,
   which means the copy will not work.

   The Jaguar CD allows delivery of full-screen, full-motion video.  The
   CinePak video decompression system has been licensed from SuperMac
   Technologies.  It is a 7K routine in the GPU and can be included in any
   CD-ROM software that needs it, allowing full-screen video at 24 frames per
   second.  Movie quality pictures can then be overlaid on the screen with
   computer generated graphics if the game demands it.  Time-Warner has
   licensed a library of film clips from its movies to Atari.

   The Jaguar CD has "Virtual Light Machine" built in.  This program plays
   audio CDs and generate accompanying color and visual effects that react to
   the music and sounds.  The user can control and select effects with the
   Jaguar controller.  Regular audio CD playback features (volume control,
   track programming, etc.) are also available.

   The Jaguar CD can also display CD+Graphics discs.  Supplimental cartridges
   for Kodak PhotoCD and MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Experts Group) compression are
   being considered.  The MPEG cartridge will reportedly include extra RAM for
   buffering and support the whitebook video format.

   The drive was being manufactured by Philips in the United States.  Its
   dimensions are 6.5" x 10.5" x 3.5", and it weighs 1 pound, 10 ounces.  The
   price was $150, and includes the TEMPEST 2000 soundtrack audio disc, a
   sampler for the CD game MYST, and two CD-ROM games: VID GRID and BLUE
   LIGHTNING.

==============================================================================

Q. What's the information on the virtual reality headset?

A. Atari Corp. and the Virtuality Group had signed a contract whereupon
   Virtuality would develop virtual reality hwardware and software for the
   Jaguar.  In return, Virtuality would get the rights to port Jaguar VR games
   to their Virtuality arcade consoles.

   Though announced, the Jaguar VR was never produced.  Unofficial reports
   conflict on whether the unit was cancelled, suspended, and/or reworked.
   Reasons given for the inaction ranged from Atari's needs to reassess their
   investments and focus on core business, to the high suggested retail price
   of the Jaguar VR headset, to Virtuality's problems in trying to create
   a mass-market headset that could track head movement fast enough to avoid
   motion sickness after a few minutes of play.

   As originally reported, the Jaguar VR package consisted of two components:

   (1) A lightweight headset (weighs less than one pound).  It can be adjusted
       for fit and works with or without glasses.  Game graphics are provided
       by a single 7", TFT active-matrix color LCD screen, with a resolution
       of 260 by 400 pixels and up to 65,000 colors.  Dual temple speakers
       provide sound, and a built-in microphone allows player communication
       in future networked games.  A custom optical system projects a
       binocular image to both eyes; it is aligned at infinity, so focus
       adjustment is not needed.  Two degrees of freedom (left/right and
       up/down) are available.  Field of view is 52 degrees horizontal by 40
       degrees vertical.

   (2) A tabletop-mounted tracking station.  The station senses the position
       of the controller and the headset with "V-Trak" infra-red tracking.
       The tracking speed is 250 Hz, with a lag time of 4 milliseconds, four
       times faster than Virtuality's arcade hardware.  The tracker has a
       range of approximately 100 degrees; multiple trackers can be daisy-
       chained together to provide a complete 360-degree tracking range, but
       most Jaguar VR games will not require a full 360 degrees.

   The Jaguar VR equipment was designed to be played while sitting down, so as
   to avoid injuries.  if a player moves out of the tracking station's range,
   a safety cutoff would have been triggered to suspend the game.

   Jaguar VR games would have been written for use with the regular
   controller, as well as a two-button "virtual gun" hand-held joystick.  The
   licensing agreement between Atari and Virtuality permitted authorized
   Jaguar third-party software developers to write their own VR titles.

   One product did come out of the Atari/Virtuality agrement.  MISSILE COMMAND
   3D for the Jaguar provided virtual-reality type play, without the need for
   special equipment or controllers.  The game was later transported to
   Virtuality's arcade systems.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What's the "Panther"?
 
A. Quick history lesson: Sometime in the late 1980s, Atari Corp. was doing
   research and development on "next generation" video game consoles.  There
   were two systems, a 32-bit machine called the Panther, and a 64-bit machine
   called the Jaguar.  It is reported that work on the Jaguar was progressing
   better/faster than expected, so Atari abandoned the Panther to focus their
   energies on the Jaguar instead.  Supposedly, if both machines were fully
   developed, the Jaguar would have followed the Panther only two years later.

   Reports of development work on the Panther have been whispered since 1988;
   some people have erroneously mistaken those rumors to be about the Jaguar.

   The Panther reportedly was considered a "32-bit" machine by Atari, though
   for reasons unknown.  It featured three chips, consisting of a Motorola
   68000 running at 16Mhz, an object processor called the Panther, and an
   Ensoniq sound processor called Otis, featuring 32 sound channels.  The
   Panther could supposedly display 8,192 colors from a palette of 262,144
   colors, and could display 65,535 sprites of any size simultaneously.

   According to Jeff Minter, the Panther's sprite hardware was very similar to
   the object processor in the Jaguar, to the point where both had the same
   limitations.  Putting too many sprites on a single scan-line, for instance,
   would require too much time to draw the line and caused a "tearing" effect
   in the affected row.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What's the "Jaguar II"?
 
A. There's been a little confusion with this topic, since at least two
   separate machines have been called a "Jaguar II."  The first was to have
   been an integrated Jaguar/Jaguar CD-ROM unit.  That project has since been
   cancelled, making the point moot.

   The other Jaguar II was Atari's next video-game console.  Though rumors
   were passed, a final design was apparently never produced for even the
   prototype stage.  The following rumors were strongly suggested, however:
 
   * Main chipset (codename "Midsummer") developed by Motorola.
   * Fully backwards compatable with the existing Jaguar.  Would have been
       able to play all Jaguar games and use all Jaguar peripherals.
   * Processing speed "two to four times faster than the Sony PlayStation."
   * Full C/C++ development package available.

==============================================================================
 
Q. Was there a difference in Jaguar games/units sold in different countries?
   Do I need to keep track of PAL and NTSC versions of a game?

A. There is no difference in the Jaguar game software.  A properly-written
   Jaguar game detects PAL or NTSC at startup and changes the playfield size
   and game speeds accordingly.  A properly-written Jaguar game will run at
   the same speed on either machine.  There are no regional or national
   market lock-outs as there are for other game consoles.

   The Jaguar consoles themselves were configured differently, according to
   the country they were sold in.  The primary differences were in the video
   output format (NTSC or PAL) and the power adapters (110 volt or 220 volt).
   Due to the Jaguar's use of an external adapter, a step-down transformer is
   not needed.  A local PSU can be used so long as it matches these
   specifications:
 
         1. 9 volt direct current (DC)
         2. 1.2 amps
         3. Center pin negative
 
   The PSUs from old Sinclair computers and Sega Game Gears can be used with
   the Jaguar without problems.
 
   To use an American (NTSC) Jaguar in Europe, you will need a new power
   adapter and a SCART lead to supply the Jaguar's RGB signals to the TV.
   Some European TV sets might have also required changing the Jaguar display
   from a 60Hz frame rate to 50Hz.
 
   The 50Hz/60Hz frame rate is set by soldering pads on the bottom of the
   Jaguar PCB.  On an NTSC Jaguar, they're located on the bottom of the PCB
   near the controller ports.  The set labelled "R140" determines between
   50Hz and 60Hz.  Connect the two points for 50Hz, or leave them
   disconnected for 60Hz, as follows:

             60Hz          50Hz
              o-o   R135    o-o
              o o   R136    o o   (Information courtesy of Martin Zimmer,
              o o   R137    o o    marz@haari.mayn.sub.de)
              o o   R140    o-o

   PAL Jaguars sold in Europe have the R140 pads connected with a zero ohm
   SMD resistor, which can be removed with a soldering iron.  It is possible
   to wire a switch to the points, allowing the Jaguar to be toggled between
   50Hz/60Hz.  This is mainly useful for PAL Jaguars to play games at the
   original speed and screen resolution of the NTSC version.

   Russ Juckes (russ_j@raiden.demon.co.uk) gives these instructions for
   finding the pads on a European/PAL Jaguar:

   "Hold the Jaguar PCB with the Joystick ports to the bottom.  On the
   underside of the board, near the joystick ports, and to the left of centre
   there are four links, the top and the bottom one bridged.  (Both with zero
   ohm resistors).  Above them there is another link, with a brown resistor.

   "The bottom link is the one that needs to be broken.  I used a penknife to
   scratch away the solder, and then a needle-nosed pair of pliers to break
   the resistor.

   "The links are *not* labelled in any way.  As another guide to make sure
   you are about to snip the correct link, they are placed directly underneath
   a chip (which is obviously on the top of the PCB!) so if you use a
   soldering iron, be careful!"

==============================================================================
 
Q. Hey!  My Jaguar makes a quiet hissing sound!  What's going on?  Is it
   dangerous?
 
A. Early Atari Jaguars had a rumored problem with the console hissing softly.
   Atari had cited several reasons for the hissing noise.  Some have said that
   the sound is from the RF generator.  The RF shield has holes in it
   (ostensibly to help air flow and keep the unit cool), and it is believed
   that the holes produce the noise.

   Others said the sounds are produced by coil L29 which is responsible for
   the proper voltage regulation to +10.0V, together with U38.  The coil's
   copper wire vibrates when the current through it changes abruptly, making
   the hiss.
 
   There are two solutions: 1) Use plastic spray or silicone rubber glue to
   fix the coil's wire. 2) Replace the original Jaguar power-supply with a
   variable power-source, using 7.5V DC instead of 9V DC (it is not certain
   whether the Jaguar CD will require 9V DC, which would make this "fix"
   unworkable with the CD drive).

   In any case, the "hissing" noise was not dangerous, but merely annoying.
   It was usually audible only if you put your ear next to the unit and listen
   closely, and is not interference in the audio output.  It is roughly
   analogous to the buzz made by electric clocks.

   Most later Jaguars did not have this problem, though a few rare cases have
   been noted.

==============================================================================

Q. My Jaguar comes up with a red screen instead of a game!  Is it broken?

A. Most often, the "red screen" problem appears after the Jaguar logo has
   disappeared off the TV screen, and is caused by one of the following:

   1. Poor contact between the Jaguar and the cartridge (most likely).  Make
   sure that the cartridge is firmly seated in the cartridge slot, and that
   contacts are not dirty/dusty.

   2. Bent pins in the cartridge slot (rare).  This may be caused by rough
   edges on some cartridges.  The pins should be carefully straightened.

   3. Defective cartridge (rare).  If the red screen only appears with one
   cartridge but not others, the game may be defective.  Exchange it for
   another.

   If the Jaguar logo appears without problems, then the Jaguar is probably
   working fine, and it's only the data transfer between the unit and the
   cartridge that's causing the problem.

==============================================================================
 
Q. I've heard stories about the Jaguar version of DOOM having network errors
   when playing with two Jaguars linked together.  Are they real?  If so, what
   causes the problem, and can I avoid it?
 
A. There is some truth to the reports -- when linking two Jaguars together for
   multiplayer DOOM games, network errors sometimes appear which interfere
   with the gameplay.  At worst, the game resets to the start of the current
   level, which can be annoying if you're in the middle of a heated Deathmatch
   firefight.
 
   The problem stems from several causes.  The networking code in DOOM was not
   thoroughly tested before release, because the game was finished before
   Atari settled on the final specifications for the JagLink cable (the cable
   came out almost a year after DOOM did).  As a result, this causes some
   problems due to integration differences.  On the other hand, some of the
   folks playing networked DOOM are using their own home-made link cables,
   which might not have enough shielding, which also causes errors.  There are
   reports that earlier Jaguar models are more susceptible to errors as well,
   but the evidence is inconclusive.
 
   Recommendations?  Set up your Jaguars in an area relatively clean of
   electromagnetic interference, make sure you are using a well-shielded
   cable, and cross your fingers.  And remember that, even with an occassional
   networking error, DOOM is still lots of fun with a friend (or foe).

Q. What's this about a rotary controller?  What games use it?  How do I make
   one for myself?

A. TEMPEST 2000 has hidden in it an option for a rotary controller (at the
   "Game Options" menu, press Pause on both controllers to activate the
   "Controller Type").  No plans for an official Atari rotary controller were
   announced, but many TEMPEST fans have been trying to build such a
   controller, to give the game a feel that's close to its arcade original.

   Andy Light has written instructions for taking a Jaguar joypad and an Atari
   2600 Driving Controller and building a rotary controller with the parts.
   His instructions are condensed below.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS THOROUGHLY
   BEFORE ASSEMBLY -- there are some areas that are left to the whim of the
   builder, and advance planning is highly recommended.

                                    * * *

   ANDY LIGHT'S JAGUAR ROTARY CONTROLLER INSTRUCTIONS
   Parts needed: Atari Jaguar controller
                 Atari 2600 Driving Controller (NOT the paddles)
                 13 wires, preferably of separate colors
                 Buttons
                 A board or box or shell to mount everything on/in
 
   1. Open the driving controller by removing the two underside screws.
   Inside is a top-like device or a grey box with three wires coming out of
   it.  This is the encoder.  Pull the driving controller's knob off the
   encoder's shaft, then remove the encoder by unscrewing the nut that holds
   it in place.  Disconnect the wires from the encoder.

   2. Open the Jaguar controller.  There are four screws on the bottom holding
   it together, behind the round rubber pads.  Inside the controller are two
   circuit boards connected by a ribbon of wires.  The bottom board is for the
   numeric keypad and is held by two screws.  Remove the screws and take out
   the keypad.

   3. Disconnect the wire ribbon from the keypad by melting the solder.
   CAREFUL!  This is delicate work -- get help if you need it.  Solder the
   thirteen wires where the ribbon connection was; do not confuse them.

   4. From the left side of the board (the side that says "P2"), I've numbered
   the wires as follows:
      1) Common         5) Button A       9) Button C      13) Down
      2) Right          6) Button B      10) Pause
      3) Option         7) Button B      11) Up
      4) Option         8) Button C      12) Left
 
   5. On the encoder, connect wire #1 to the center terminal, #2 to the right
   terminal, and #12 to the left terminal.  The rotary part of the controller
   is now finished.

   6. How to connect the other controls is up to you.  I'm using arcade
   buttons, a thumbpad, and a switch (to toggle joypad or rotary control)
   mounted in an Atari 5200 trak-ball controller case.  You can mount a
   joystick, extra buttons, or other features for your own controller.
   Buttons and empty control boxes are available at stores such as Radio
Shack.

   Wiring for the other signals are as follows:
         Up       - wires #1 and #11       Button A - wires #1 and #5
         Down     - wires #1 and #13       Button B - wires #6 and #7
         Pause    - wires #1 and #10       Button C - wires #8 and #9
         Option   - wires #3 and #4
   Because wire #1 has multiple uses, you will either need to string it or
   split it for each destination.

   7. Reassemble and mount everything according to your design.  For better
   spin, you can glue lead fishing sinkers to the inside of the knob, and
   lubricate the shaft of the encoder with light oil or silicone lubricant.

   That's it!  Please forgive me for any mistakes in my grammer, terminology,
   spelling, etc.  If you encounter any problems, feel free to e-mail me at

Q. I want something better than RF output from my Jaguar.  What do I do?
 
A. Atari had an S-Video cable and a Composite video cable available for use
   with the Jaguar.  See the "Peripherals" section for details.

   If you are willing to build your own, the schematics for the expansion port
   are as follows:

Q. How did the ComLynx port on the Jaguar work?  Could I connect my Lynx to
   it?

A. The Jaguar does not have a ComLynx port per se, but has a ComLynx signal
   on the system bus.  An expansion port add-on would have made the port
   available, and developers had announced plans for such accessories.  It is
   possible to daisy-chain multiple Jaguars for multiplayer games into a
   "Jaguar network".  In theory, it would have also been possible to connect
   Jaguars and Lynxes, though no plans for cross-system software were ever
   finalized.

   There was also talk that the Jaguar's ComLynx signal could allow Lynxes to
   be used as peripherals: software could have been developed to allow Lynxes
   to be part of a Jaguar game as "smart" controllers.  Again, no actual plans
   were ever announced.

   For enterprising engineers who wish to build a ComLynx cable for two
   Jaguars, the following schematics from jonin@netcom.com are available.
   USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

                                    * * *

          12 Contact IDE Card Edge Connector (Atari Jaguar DSP Connector)    

   View from the front of the connector (not the solder side):

                Key signals: 2 - Transmit, 3 - Receive, 6 - Ground

   Assembly Notes:
     As shown, the only 3 wires needed for the cable are 2, 3 and 6 (Tx, Rx,
     and Ground).  All of these wires are on the bottom connector, so that
     is a good indicater of which way the cable plugs in the Jaguar.
     Shielded and RF-Choked cables work best.  Due to the nature of this
     connector, it will be hard to shield this cable completely.

     If you cannot find a 12-contact IDE Card Edge Connector, a 10-contact
     version can be used.  A quick one can be built with no soldering using
     JDR MicroDevices (Part# IDE10).  This is made for ribbon cable, but you
     can use regular shielded cables with a little work.  As long as lines 2,
     3, and 6 remain properly connected, there should be no difference.

   Usage tips:
   * DO NOT PLUG THIS CABLE IN UPSIDE-DOWN!  You may damage internal
       components if you plug it incorrectly.
   * TURN OFF BOTH JAGUARS BEFORE CONNECTING.  You may damage internal
       components if you do not.
   * Since there isn't much strengh in the wires, remove the cable by the
       connectors.

Q. Agh!  My Jaguar is broken!  How can I fix it?
 
A. Unforutnately, with the dissolution of Atari Corp., repair or replacement
   of broken Jaguars is no longer available; Atari/JTS does not have any units
   remaining for sale or replacement.  On the other hand, with the low price
   of clearance Jaguars today, it isn't expensive to buy a new unit.

Q. How was development for the Jaguar done?
 
A. Jaguar game development environments existed for the Atari TT030 computer
   or an IBM PC/compatible.  Art development could be performed on any
   machine, whether a low-end Apple Macintosh or commercial rendering software
   such as SoftImage.  Wavefront's "GameWare" was the official 2D/3D graphics
   development system; Atari itself used GameWare for in-company development,
   and registered third-party Jaguar developers could buy GameWare licenses at
   special discount prices.

   Estimated price for a developer's package was $9,000 for the TT030 setup,
   and $7,500 for the PC/compatible platform.  The package included a Jaguar
   development unit, documentation, and development/debugging software.
   The Jaguar had modified boot firmware to run the development board (the
   "Alpine board"), and it had a cable coming out to provide signals to the
   Alpine board that are not normally present via the cartridge connector.

   CD-ROM developement packages (including the cartridge development kit) were
   ranged at about $8,000, and were upgradeable from the card-only kit.

   Software routines packaged with the system included a multi-channel
   polyphonic FM/Wavetable synth; JPEG decompression; video set-up; drawing
   primitives; 3D rendering with gourad shading, texture mapping, and camera
   manipulation.  GCC is the primary 68000 C compiler; support for other
   languages was not available from Atari, but developers were free to use
   whatever tools they may prefer.  The development toolkit ran under DOS,
   TOS, or Linux.  Work was proceeding on a Linux development system using the
   GNU tools.

   The centerpiece of the TT030 deveopment platform was DB, an assembly-
   language level debugging tool.  The Jaguar and the TT030 were connected
   with a parallel cable, and software could be debugged interactively without
   interfering with the Jaguar's screen display.  DB supported the use of
   scripts and aliases, which simplified the use of complex or common
   functions.

   Support for the development packages was primarily provided by Brainstorm
   (Atari France), who worked closely with Atari Corp.

   Atari granted final code approval, but did not see the need to "censor"
   games.  Every game was given one man-month of compatibility and quality
   testing before it was approved.  Atari offered technical support via FAX,
   mail, electronic mail and voice.  Atari allowed developers to source their
   own cartridges, documentation and shells if desired.  Jaguar software is
   encrypted with a proprietary key, thus preventing unauthorized developers
   from releasing Jaguar software.

   Cross Products (SNASM) offered an alternative Jaguar Development system.
   It came with a multiwindowed debugger, assemblers, compilers, and SCSI
   support, for approximately $3,700.  The package allowed for full screen,
   source level debugging of multiple processors, in C or assembler.  This was
   software only for the IBM PC; the Jaguar development hardware (Alpine
   board, modified Jaguar, etc.) had to be purchased separately from Atari.

   Ambitious hobbists have started their own unendorsed Jaguar development
   efforts, with several "home-brewed" development systems and electronic
   documentation of the Jaguar's inner workings.  Several games have been
   written for play on the "Jaguar Server" development system (requires some
   hardware modification to an existing Jaguar, and an IBM PC or Atari ST
   computer).

Q. What was the Atari Lynx?

A. The Lynx was the world's first hand-held color video game system.  Sold by
   Atari, the Lynx offered true multi-player competition, built-in 3D and
   distortion graphic effects, reversible controls, and fast arcade action.

==============================================================================

Q. What was included when you bought a Lynx?

A. The Lynx was available in two packages:

   Originally, the Lynx "Deluxe Package" included the Lynx unit, a copy of the
   CALIFORNIA GAMES game card, a carrying case, a ComLynx cable, and an AC
   adaptor.  Later the adaptor was replaced with six AA Alkaline batteries.
   The Lynx "Base Package" came with only the Lynx but no accessories.

   Near the end of the Lynx's retail life, some stores were selling a
   "maximum" Lynx package, consisting of the Lynx itself and four games.  It
   was primarily a clearance/liquidation move, and is no longer available.

==============================================================================

Q. What happened to Atari, anyway?

A. The trials and tribulations of Atari could fill a small book (and, in fact,
   once did).  To summarize VERY briefly, the history of Atari is as follows:

     1972   Atari Inc. founded by Nolan Bushnell from a $250 investment.
              Pong arcade game becomes a smash sensation.
     1976   Atari Inc. sold by Bushnell to Warner Inc. for $28 million.
     1980   Atari Inc. posts record sales.  $2 billion profits annually.
              Atari occupies 80 offices in Sunnyvale, CA.
     1983   Decline of video games and irresponsible spending by Atari Inc.
              results in record losses ($536 million, up to $2 million daily).
     1984   Warner divides Atari Inc.  Home division (Atari Corp.) is sold to
              Jack Tramiel.
     1985   Atari Corp. releases Atari ST home computer.
     1989   Atari Corp. releases Atari Lynx, the world's first color hand-held
              video game system.
     1993   Atari Corp. releases Atari Jaguar, the world's first 64-bit home
              video game system (see the Atari Jaguar FAQ).
     1994   Atari Games becomes Time-Warner Interactive.
     1996   Time-Warner Interactive (Atari Games) sold to WMS.
     1996   Atari Corp. announces reverse merger with JTS Corporation.

Q. What was the relationship between the Atari Lynx and Epyx?

A. The Lynx was originally conceived by Epyx in 1987.  It was called the
   "Handy" at that time.  Two creators of the system, Dave Needle and R.J.
   Mical, were also members of the Amiga design team.  Atari bought the
   rights to the Lynx and to Epyx's library of titles, and the rest is
   history.  Epyx no longer has any connection with Atari or the Lynx.

==============================================================================

Q. What are the specifications of the Lynx?

A. Physical dimensions:

       Size: 9.25" x 4.25" x 2" (10.75" x 4.25" x 1.5" for original Lynx)
     Screen: 3.5" diagonal (3.25" x 1.88" approx.)
    Speaker: 2" diameter

    Buttons: Two sets of fire buttons (A and B)
             Two option buttons (OPTION 1 and OPTION 2)
             Pause button
             (OPTION 1 + Pause = Restarts the game
              OPTION 2 + Pause = Flips the screen, which allows the Lynx
              controls to be reversed)
             Power on light (Not on original Lynx; indicates unit is on)
             Power on button
             Power off button
             Backlight button (Not on original Lynx; turns off the screen,
               but does not turn off the game.  This saves electricity use
               when a game is paused)
     Joypad: Eight directional
   Controls: Volume
             Brightness
      Ports: Headphones (mini-DIN 3.5mm stereo; wired for mono on the
               original Lynx)
             ComLynx (multiple unit communications)
             Power (9V DC, 1 A)
             Game card slot
             Battery holder (six AA)

  For the technically minded, the Lynx has two basic chips that form a
  cooperative set of co-processing subsystems that maximize the Lynx's
  performance by sharing the work of executing a game program.  These
  chips are called Mikey and Suzy.

  Mikey (16-bit custom CMOS chip running at 16MHz)
  - MOS 65C02 processor running at up to 4MHz (~3.6MHz average)
      8-bit CPU, 16-bit address space
  - Sound engine
       4 channel sound
       8-bit DAC for each channel
       (4 channels x 8-bits/channel = 32 bits commonly quoted)
       Atari reports the range is "100Hz to above the range of human
         hearing"; spectrum analysis shows the range may go as low as 32Hz.
       Stereo with panning (mono for original Lynx)
  - Video DMA driver for LCD display
      4096 color (12-bit) palette
      16 simultaneous colors (4 bits) from palette per scanline (more than 16
      colors can be displayed by changing palettes after each scanline)
  - System timers
  - Interrupt controller
  - UART (for ComLynx)
  - 512 bytes of bootstrap and game-card loading ROM

  Suzy (16-bit custom CMOS chip running at 16MHz)
  - Blitter (bit-map block transfer) unit
  - Graphics engine
      Hardware drawing support
      Unlimited number of high-speed sprites with collision detection
      Hardware high-speed sprite scaling, distortion, and tilting effects
      Hardware decoding of compressed sprite data
      Hardware clipping and multi-directional scrolling
      Variable frame rate (up to 75 frames/second)
      160 x 102 "triad" standard resolution (16,320 addressable pixels)
      (A triad is three LCD elements: red, green, and blue)
      Capability of 480 x 102 artificially high resolution
  - Math co-processor
      Hardware 16-bit multiply and divide (32-bit answer)
      Parallel processing of single multiply or divide instruction

   The Lynx contains 64K (half a megabit) of 120ns DRAM.  Game cards
   currently hold 128K (1 megabit) or 256K (2 megabits) of ROM, but there
   is a maximum capacity of up to 2 megabytes (16 megabits) on one game card.
   In theory, this limit can be exceeded with extra bank-switching hardware
   in the card.  Most Lynx game cards are 128K ROMs.  Three games are on
   512K ROMs: NINJA GAIDEN 3, PIT FIGHTER, and JIMMY CONNORS TENNIS.

   The first few hundred bytes of the game card is encrypted to prevent
   unauthorized developers from writing Lynx software.  This scheme was
   introduced by Epyx as an effort to enforce game quality.

   With alkaline batteries, the reasonable average battery life is 5 hours.
   (4 hours with the original Lynx)  The Lynx can run off rechargeable
   Ni-Cad batteries, but average battery life drops drastically to 1.5 hours
   per recharge (1 hour for the original Lynx).  Your mileage may vary.

==============================================================================

Q. What were the differences between the original Lynx ("Lynx Classic") and
   the later-model Lynx ("Lynx II")?

A. The Lynx II is a bit smaller and lighter than the original Lynx.  It had a
   slightly longer battery life, and can also just turn the screen off during
   a game pause to save batteries.  (The original Lynx had a five minute
   auto-power shut-off that would have prevented this from being useful.  It
   was removed in the Lynx II).  A power LED was added (which also blinks
   when battery power is low), and cartridges are easier to insert.

   The only differences in a technical sense is that the Lynx II has a more
   efficient internal design, and the headphone jack supports stereo sound.
   The speaker in the Lynx II is also not as loud as the original Lynx, though
   it's more than adequate for all but the noisiest situations.

   Also, the Lynx II can experience what is called "blinking pixel syndrome".
   With certain game cards, one pixel on the screen (usually stationary)
   cycles through all the colors very quickly.  It does not affect game play,
   and isn't always noticed unless it's looked for.  It seems to be fixed in
   later Lynxes, making it even less of a factor.

   The power consumption in the Lynx II is about fifteen percent less than
   that of the original Lynx.  Harry Dodgson (hdodgson@ford.com) shows Classic
   using 343 mA, versus 296 mA for the Lynx II.  Also, about two-thirds of the
   Lynx power use is for the backlight screen alone, as using the Lynx II with
   the backlight off used only 97 mA.  He concludes, "the 'battery life of
   five hours' claim by Atari is realistic."

==============================================================================

Q. Is the Lynx an 8-bit or 16-bit system?

A. If 16-bit refers to the main CPU (such as the Sega Genesis/MegaDrive), then
   the Lynx is an 8-bit system.  If 16-bit refers to the graphics engine
   (such as the NEC TurboDuo/PC-Engine), then the Lynx is a 16-bit system.

==============================================================================

Q. Why does the Lynx use a 6502 and not a 68000?

A. "Some people believe it's less of a processor than the 68000, for example.
   That series of chip was used in the Amiga, but it wouldn't make our machine
   do things any better.  In fact, it would only make the unit larger and more
   expensive.  It's also harder to write 68000 code, so we definitely made the
   right decision."
                                                --R.J. Mical

   "The real answer for the choice for the 6502 vs. 68000 was price.
   Secondary considerations (that did not really enter into the decision
   making process): 68000 code is very fat compared to 6502 code.  An
   application that takes 1K of 6502 code averages 2.5 to 3K of 68000 code.
   The 6502 is very bus-efficient, the 68000 has lots of dead time on the
   bus.  As for it being harder to write 68000 code, that is probably not
   true, and in any case was not part of the reason the decision was made."
                                                --Stephen Landrum

   Additionally, inside sources at Atari said that one major reason for the
   6502 vs 68000 processor choice was that the 6502 design was available as a
   component that could be plugged into a custom chip design.  This allowed
   engineers to build a chip with a 6502 and other supporting hardware around
   it all in one package.  It was not until 1993-1994 that Motorola offered
   the 68000 as a design component.

Q. What were the unreleased Lynx games?

A: The following games were announced at one time or another as being planned
   for the Lynx.  With the dissolution of Atari, the chances are very slim
   that any of these games will ever be produced or released.  However, a few
   enterprising companies and individuals have considered plans to either
   finish their Lynx titles for release, to sell finished-but-unreleased
   games, or to produce new games on their own.

==============================================================================

Q. Was there a TV tuner option for the Lynx?

A. No.  Atari's official position was that market research showed that a TV
   tuner, while a neat idea, would not be bought by most players.  The
   unofficial word from Stephen Landrum is that the Lynx screen display is not
   capable of handling a broadcast television picture.

Q. How do you get a Lynx screen shot, anyway?

A. Atari had an experimental adaptor for the Lynx that allowed graphics to
   be shown on a conventional television set.  This was used to demonstrate
   Lynx games for corporate meetings, as well as providing videotape footage
   and screen grabs for the media.  Reportedly, only two or three of the
   adaptors were ever made, and each one cost $3,000 to manufacture.

   More enterprising players may get "screen shots" of Lynx games by running
   one of the Lynx emulators on a personal computer, then taking screen shots
   from there.  More information about Lynx emulators can be found elsewhere
   in this FAQ.

%  In a show of ingenuity, Wizztronics plans to release a Lynx-to-TV converter
%  in August 1998.  This device will sell for $99.95, and allows a Lynx screen
%  image to be displayed on a television set.  The device requires a Lynx II,
%  and must be installed in order to work.  More details will be provided when
%  they are available. Wizztronics has a web site devoted to the converter, at
%  http://www.wizztronics.com/lynx.htm

==============================================================================

Q. What can I use to carry my Lynx game cards?

A. A cheap and easy solution is the plastic cases used to hold trading cards.
   They're transparent, sturdy, and lock shut when closed.  Most hobby and
   comic book stores will sell them; a large case costs $0.50 to $1.00, and
   can hold up to 14 Lynx cards.

   Another solution are Lynx card wallets.  Sold by Hardysoft, a wallet costs
   $7.50 each, or you can buy three for $20.  Each wallet holds 9 cards
   firmly.  To order, write to:

           Charlie Hardy

   For Lynx owners who don't care about brand names, a Gameboy plastic
   cartridge case holds two Lynx cards easily.  The cases can be bought from
   Nintendo at 800-255-3700, part number 21648.

==============================================================================

Q. What does "ComLynx" mean, exactly?

A. Some Lynx games allow multiple players to play together simultaneously.
   This works when each player has a Lynx game machine, and all of the
   machines are connected to each other via cables.  The connection is the
   ComLynx port, and the cables are ComLynx cables.  Games that support this
   mutiplayer simultaneous play are usually identified by the phrase "1 to N
   players Lynx up" on the box, the instruction manual, and/or the game card.

==============================================================================

Q. Do all players "Lynxed up" via the ComLynx need a copy of the game being
   played?

A. Yes.  All players need a copy of the game card.  An early idea that Epyx
   had considered for the Lynx was to use magnetic tapes(!) instead of
   ROM cards, for lower costs and to support multiple players with one copy
   of the game (the idea was that you could load the game into the first Lynx,
   remove the tape, load it into the second Lynx, and so on).  This idea was
   abandoned because the Lynx's 64K of DRAM was insufficient to store a game,
   but not before spawning rumors that multi-player Lynx games only needed one
   copy of the title.

==============================================================================

Q. What's the ComLynx port like?

A. There is a limit of 18 players via ComLynx.  In practice it may be possible
   to connect more units together, but to operate within specifications, the
   drivers in the Lynx cannot drive over more than 17 units with pull-ups on
   the serial ports.  It's easier for the Lynx to manage fewer players,
   however, since each Lynx has to track all of the others, and having more
   players means more data must be exchanged (growth is exponential).  Also,
   tracking more than 8 players requires an extra byte to encode the Lynx unit
   number with each data packet.

   ComLynx runs from 300.5 to 62.5K baud.  It works on a "listen and send"
   structure.  Data transmission between Lynxes is done in the background,
   freeing up the CPU to run the game instead of communicating.  It's called
   "RedEye" in-house at Atari, named after an early idea of having Lynxes
   communicate with infra-red transmissions.

   It uses a three-wire cable (+5V/Ground/Data) and allows for bi-directional
   serial communications.  The system frames messages in terms of 11-bit
   words, each consisting of a start bit, eight data bits, a parity bit, and a
   stop bit.  The ComLynx port is used solely for communications; it can't be
   used to control other aspects of the Lynx, though in theory it can be used
   to send signals to external devices.

==============================================================================

Q. Sometimes a multiplayer ComLynx game will freeze up.  Why?

A. A ComLynxed game will freeze if communication between the Lynxes is
   interrupted.  If communications can be restored, the game will continue.
   The most common cause of this problem is a fray in one of the ComLynx
   cables, or a loose seating in one of the ComLynx jacks.  Communication is
   broken, and the game "freezes".  Jiggling the cable or reseating the jacks
   may fix the solution temporarily, but the best cure is a new cable.

==============================================================================

Q. I hear there was a ComLynx port on the Atari Jaguar.  How did that work?
   Could I connect my Lynx to it?  Was there a Lynx adaptor for the Jaguar?

A. The Jaguar does not have a ComLynx port per se, but has a ComLynx signal
   on the system bus.  An expansion port add-on would have made the port
   available, and developers had announced plans for such accessories.  It is
   possible to daisy-chain multiple Jaguars for multiplayer games into a
   "Jaguar network".  In theory, it would have also been possible to connect
   Jaguars and Lynxes, though no plans for cross-system software were ever
   finalized.

   There was also talk that the Jaguar's ComLynx signal could allow Lynxes to
   be used as peripherals: software could have been developed to allow Lynxes
   to be part of a Jaguar game as "smart" controllers.  Again, no actual plans
   were ever announced.

   An adaptor to allow the Jaguar to play Lynx games was never planned.

==============================================================================

Q. My Lynx screen is badly scratched!  How can I fix it, what can I do?

A. Get some "plastic scratch remover" or "plexiglass scratch remover".  You
   can find it in hardware stores, or look in your Yellow Pages under
   "Plastics."

==============================================================================

Q. Agh! My Lynx is broken! How can I fix it?

A. Unforutnately, with the dissolution of Atari Corp., repair of broken Lynxes
   is no longer available.  Replacement units are currently available from
   CWest for $45, until quantities run out.  CWest can be reached at
   (800) GO-ATARI.

==============================================================================

Q. How do I disassemble my Lynx II (assuming I want to)?

A. The original Lynxes are easy to take apart, for whatever reason you
   needed.  The new Lynx IIs are more puzzling, but not impossible.  The
   following set of (edited) instructions are provided by Ken Small
   (kens@umich.edu):

                                    * * *

   "It's not hard, but there are a lot of fragile pieces and the electronics
   are sensitive to all the things that electronics are usually sensitive to,
   like static.  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.

   "First, remove the rubber pads from the bottom of the Lynx.  They're glued
   on, but they peel off pretty easily.  Beneath them are screw holes --
   remove them.  Note that it's *very* easy to tell if your lynx has been
   opened, since you leave holes in the glue stuff.  Take off the back of the
   case.

   "Remove the screw located inside the battery area.  Be careful when
   replacing this; it can strip easily.  Mine is stripped, but the rest of the
   case holds the battery bay in place.  Remove the battery bay piece.

   "You will see a circuit board with a couple of wires and circuit ribbons
   attached to it.  Carefully unplug all of these.  The ribbon in particular
   seems flimsy.  Do not puncture or otherwise damage it.  Remove the circuit
   board.

   "Beneath the circuit board is an assembly screwed to the inside of the
   case, which contains the screen, button contacts and buttons.  A warning
   when unscrewing this-- the are LOTS of small pieces in here, and they're
   particular about how they go back in.  In particular, be careful about the
   A/B buttons, which are slightly different sizes, and the rubber mat around
   the LCD screen, which has nothing to hold it in place.  (NOTE: Also, there
   are contacts on the circuit board hooked up to the high-voltage supply for
   the backlight. They won't do any damage, but can give a mild shock.)

   "The last thing is the joypad contact itself.  This is a small rubber mat
   held in place by a snap-on piece of plastic.  You can carefully remove the
   plastic to get under the apron, where the contacts can be cleaned.  Clean
   in-between the contacts, being careful not to abrase the contacts
   themselves.  They look like half-circles with a small (half-millimeter or
   less) space between.  Grunge between them can register an intermittent
   false contact, which looks to the player like the joypad is being quickly,
   repeatedly pressed in one direction."

==============================================================================
 
Q. I have some dust under my Lynx screen; how can I clean it?
 
A. The original Lynxes are easy to take apart; simply remove the screws,
   disassemble the Lynx, then wipe the screen clean.
 
   It is possible to disassemble the Lynx II and clean its screen in a similar
   way, but there is an easier alternative.  According to John Daniels, "The
   front screen on the Lynx 2 snaps on and off (easier to snap on than off
   though).  The transparent area and the area surrounding the small buttons
   near the screen is one big piece of plastic.  It snaps on with a lip on the
   top and bottom edge. ... It takes a pretty sturdy sharp edge, but once you
   start it moving, it just pops off and then you can clean the area between
   the plastic screen and the LCD."
 
   For cleaning, plain water or cleaning liquid will work fine.  It is
   recommended that you allow your screen to dry before reassembling the Lynx,
   to reduce the danger of damaging the electronics.
 
==============================================================================

Q. What's this about Lynx emulators?  Can I play Lynx games on my PC?

A. Proving that old consoles never die, but get transposed on other platforms
   instead, a number of resourceful folks have written emulators of the Atari
   Lynx.  This is not as trivial as it sounds, as these authors are working
   without official Atari/Epyx documentation, and therefore spend a lot of
   time reverse-engineering the Lynx's processors.  They've reached varying
   degrees of success, but the field is a fast-changing one, and what might
   be insurmountable today could seem trivial tomorrow.

   Because these are software emulators, there is no current method to run
   Lynx cartridges directly off your home computer.  However, some folks have
   managed to secure ROM dumps of Lynx games, and the emulators can run those
   images instead.

   Here are some resources for further information about Lynx emulators:

Q. What was the Lynx developer's kit like?

A. Hardware:
   - Commodore Amiga computer: 3M RAM and hard disk.
   - "Howard" board: A parallel-interface module that has the electronics
     of the Lynx, also with debugging tools.  A large PC board inside of
     a metal case with power supply, and connections on the back for
     cable to connect to the Amiga, and to the "Howdy" unit ($5,000).
   - "Howdy" unit: A small PC board in a plastic case with buttons and a
     Lynx display, and a cable that connects to the "Howard" board.
   - "Pinky/Mandy": A discounted "Howard" board setup that allows programs to
     be loaded and executed.  Minimal debugging support ($500).

   Software:
   - Handy-Bug: A powerful symbolic debugger, also contains a disassembler.
   - Handicraft: Graphics translator that takes IFF files and turns them
     into coded Lynx sprite definitions.
   - HSFX: Sound editor
   - "HandyROM": Creates ROM card images from code and data files.
   - Macro libraries
   - Example programs
   - Notebook of system documentation (approximately 270 double-sided pages,
     weighs over three pounds).

   The cost of a full Lynx Developer's Kit was around $5,000.

No, actually, I just called them and left a voice message, asking them about
when would be a good time to order a CatBox since some orders were taking so
long.  He called me back and left a message on my voice mail and said they
would be shipping in August.

<grin>  There's actually a town near me named Montezuma, but it's in

I don't think that the Jaguars potential was ever fully tapped in the games 
we have seen so far. The Jag didn't have top developers that push the limits of 
hardware on other systems (Psygnosis,Namco,Konami,Capcom etc.). They didn't have 
much of the top talent, mostly smaller,upstart developers you never heard of before. 
I think that the later releases are the best looking as would be expected as 
developers come to grips with the hardware. The Jag never really got very far beyond 
it's first generation of software. Think of how good the second and third generation 
of software would have looked if Atari was able to stick around that long. Imagine 
AvP 2 or Tempest 4000 after programmers applied all they learned from their first 
efforts. That's what we are looking at, most companies first and only stab at a game 
on the Jag. Look at how good Shens' Super Burnout looks and sounds. Shen was working 
on Zzyorxx(a shooter) and Indiana Jags(platformer) that were never released. 
Considering how good their first game looked I bet it would have turned out great.  
               Take a look at a first generation PSX title now and it looks pretty 
ugly. Imagine if the PSX never took off and they never got out any 2nd or 3rd 
generation titles,then people would think that Cybersled,Zero Divide and Tekken 1 
were what the hardware was only capable of. I think the JAG could do a good looking 
game like Tobal 2 since gourard? shaded polygons is what the system was designed to 
do.
 As long as you didn't go crazy and try to texture map everything, the Jag could do 
really great looking games. The Jag is fast, can do polygons, fast 2d, it just can't 
do heavily texture mapped games.
         As far as the game that I think shows the most potential of the hardware I 
would have to say Missle Command 3-D, definately. Huge polygon bosses, cool 
underwater effects, fully 3D, good framerate, texture mapping. 
         As far as future game releases, I remember reading long ago that Telegames 
had bought 16 more Jag games after the initial ones we know 
about(B2K,WTR,Z5,T2,worms,IS2). I guess they were going to see how the initial batch 
did and release more if the 6 games sold well enough.
 There definately are more games they could have bought. Here's some I know about 
that could be released.   

Phase Zero, said to complete except no last,end level
SkyHammer, was available for download through the Time Warner Cable, Full Service 
Network in Orlando,Florida up to Sept of last year when the FSN was discontinued. 
This was not the Beta version reviewed in the Atari Times that crashed all the time.
Brett Hull Hockey, was reviewed in Next Generation, got 3 stars, I know about the 
NHL license problems with this game being released.
Tetrisphere(aka Sphere) was 90% complete, a bunch of people played this at the      
 '95 WCES and said it was great. Probably just needs music/sound effects.
Bomberman-  confirmed finished by Next Generation online
Space War 2000- said to be complete, cool split screen 2 player action

These had been worked on but who knows how much was done or if they're complete?
Zzyorxx
Indiana Jags
Arena Football
Thea Realm Fighters
Conan, looked good, said to be cool by those who saw it. People played this. Is     
          there more than one level done?
Highlander 2 - I read 1,2,3 were all worked on at the same time, only 1 got released
Return Fire
Black Ice/White noise
Legions of the Undead
Battlezone 2000 (this is not Hover Strike)
Dactyl Joust , there's a bad screen shot, thats all?
Freelancer 2120
Soul Star
Charles Barkley Basketball

Some of these Jagserver games could be released on a multi game cart or CD
Native 
Jagmania
Painter
Jagtris
Marble Madness(Jagmarble)
Gorf 2000
Bong 1999

These may or may not be done but who cares anyway? They're just PC ports
Commander Blood
Robinson's Requim
Dragon's Lair 2
Varuna's Forces

      Why bother. You know all he'll do is a remake of an old game he 
remade a hundred times before on the Vic-20, Atari ST, C-64, Amiga. 
 You know what it would be, Llammatron 2084.  Yawn :O

    I have to agree that this is a decent port overall, even more so than the
over-modernized "Great Moments" version for Windows.

    On occasion, I will have a hard time identifying tiles that are "buried"
behind nearby tiles that are a couple levels higher, due to the isometric view,
but it's only a minor nuisance.  Likewise, cursor manipulation is pretty good;
no complaints there.

    I'll say.  A lot of other games of this type tout a "variety" in BGM on the
box and manual, only to offer only two BGMs, which end up sounding very much
the same (Interplay's 5-in-1 Fun Pak for Game Gear comes to mind.).  Shanghai
has a very well-rounded variety among its four tunes, from calm and relaxing
(the third tune) to fast and upbeat (the second tune).

    More than two graphic sets would have been nice.  This is a feature that
shines in Mah Jongg VGA for the PC; many graphic sets to choose from, plus a
toolkit to design custom-made sets.
    The many different tile configurations definitely give this game extra
replay value.  Some are easier than the Dragon; others are harder.  One in
particular (I think it was the Turtle) took a long time to finish.

    I never did play this game (or any Lynx game for that matter) multiplayer.

    My best strategy tip is to bear in mind that there are four of each
matching tile.  Watch for three available identical tiles, and pick the two
that are obscuring the most tiles.  Of course if all four tiles are available
then knock them all off and forget about them.  Keeping a log of tiles removed
can be helpful, but would be a pain!  A "pouch" feature would have been nice
for this game.

Excuse me Robotron2084 is remade because it was and is a great game.
Peroid
Have you played this game for an extended period. After a half hour
(when youve played it for a few weeks prior) you hit this sort of trance
connection with the game. Where you are really no longer thinking but
going on instinct. In fact if you have to think your way out of the
situation your dead. Its an incredible experience to a gamer to be
toatally overwhelmed by the enemies numbers only to somehow shot out a
small hole narrow enough to fit through but closing fast and without
thinking you pull it off. Better yet to be running from several Brains
tracking lasers while pickin up the 5000 bonus people an shooting behind
you .Not once worried a laser will hit you because you are in controll
of the game. Then theres Quarks, Tanks, Grunts, Enforcers, Spheroids and
more. This is Robotrons beauty and I would be happy to see it on any
system. No yawning allowed in Robotron : )

I would.
Sure, it wouldn't be that great of a picture.  Sure, it would suck the life

I'd still buy one.
Hell, I would probably buy two.

I found a single screenshot of a so-called "Jagulator" emulator playing 
Battlesphere! A quick glance at the shot shows that it reports itself running 
at 6.5 frames per second!!

Personally, I won't believe that anybody could make a Jaguar emulator 
until I've got it purring on my own computer... but with the recent releases 
of very good Neo Geo emulators and some 
slow-as-molasses-and-can't-play-much-at-all-if-anything-other-than-demos 
Playstation and N64 emulators, I'm left scratching my head...

Since it's got "something" to do with Battlesphere (in a roundabout way), I 
decided to post it on The Battlesphere Shrine for all to see... located right 
around the corner at: http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/shelly/55/bsmain.html

Let me know what you think... I'm off to retrace my steps and figure out 
exactly where I got this baby.

Hey all...

My CD player broke a few days ago, so I've been using the Jaguar CD for
my musical pleasure (my fiance LOVES the Video Light Machine - who can
blame her?)

Anyway, I tried a variety of musical styles and tunes... but could NOT
get "Ray of Light" from Madonna's newest CD to cue up at all! The CD
itself is brand new and I tested it in my rommate's CD player, and all
is good. 

I have read and re-read the insruction book to se if I was missing
something, as all the other CDs played fine. I can't figure it out.

Any ideas?????

Kyle :^)

ANNOUNCEMENT: New Atari Lynx game : TNT-Terry

Hi,

I'd like to announce my game for the Lynx: TNT-Terry. It's a
bomberman/dynablaster clone.

It'll feature 3 or 4 entirely different sceneries, lot's of levels,
detailled animation, lots of opponents+powerups, and, probably best of all:
MULTIPLAYER! My best guess right now is that at least 4 players should be
able to challange eachother, perhaps more.

If you want to see most of it, goto JAGFEST today, since you can play it for
yourself there. There'll be 2 democopies, unfortunately without multiplayer.

Or, if you can't come to JagFest, be sure to check out my website about
TNT-Terry at
http://home.wxs.nl/~lsimonis/lynx/tntterry

If you've got anything you want to share with me regarding my game, please
mail me! Any reaction is welcome, be it wish-lists, general idea's or just a
'Hi! I like it': everyhing is more than welcome.

Laurens Simonis
lmsimonis@wxs.nl
http://home.wxs.nl/~lsimonis/lynx

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This is a hobby project. I haven't got a big rich firm behind me, I have to
write this all in my spare time, as goes for my graphics artist. I CANNOT
and WILL NOT make any promises of when the game's released, what will be in
it and what wouldn't. I just know that's what in it, probably will stay in
it, unless I think it's better to remove it. So no promises made,
unfortunately.

It's possible there is other data on this particular CD, such as a Windows
executable that your CD player can't see, but your Jag CD can.  Try putting the
Madonna CD (ugh - why am I responding tho this??) in a PC and snoop around for
anything other than audio files

There's nothing all too wrong with that.  I would've loved to have seen him
do
Major Havoc 2000.  He said if the Jag didn't die like it did, that was
going to
be his next port to the Jag.

Got to admit, the man loved the classic arcade.  And that was he specialty,
re-vamping the classics.

You can tell it's a hoaks here because how would they have a copy of the BS Code?
To my knowledge there are a maximum of 6 people who have copies of it to coding
and testing.  None of them would give it away.

Actually, the Toshinden supposedly pushed the most polygons of any fighter up to Tekken
3 because Sony told them how to bypass the os and hit the hardware.  But Sony didn't
want to people to do that, so they made everyone go through the OS.  Stilla very good
game(the one that made me consider a PSX).  1st gen isn't always teh best, but you'll
find a lot more creativity out than the 3rd generation of Super Street Mortal World
Kombat Fighter Alpha 2.

Never finished.  I have the last copy they sent o Atari and it's pitiful.Be happy you

Well that's neet.  I also have the final edition of it. An OK game that would've been
cool three years ago, but by today's standards it's very dated and slow.

Bought by Nintendo - you'll never see it for the Jag.

Finished without a license.

Finished but Atari dropped it because A two year old Battlesphere beat the crap out of
it in a independant testing group.  According to the people out there, it played pretty
much like a poor Hoverstrike in space.

After 8-9 months, Atari didn't like the way it was going and pulled the original

Finished - Not worth the Rom is would be put on.

   Someone else had a copy of this they reviewed on their webpage. They kind of 
ragged on it alot saying the HUD's looked really 16 bit. Sounded like a dull game.
 Just what the Jaguar needed, another game where you fly around in a hard to control
  hover-car type vehicle in an ugly landscape. Hey they could always release it and 
call it Air Cars 2. It'll seem great in comparison.

   I wonder if it could be worked on some more to spruce it up and then release a 
   faster, better version of it.

   Is Ninten-dough still sticking to that exclusivity crap. It sure didn't last 
long. What if you change the name to Jagu-sphere?

    A license to the name Bomberman. Call it Bomberguy and release it.

     This is a real shame. I really liked the first one and you could tell they put 
     a lot of work into it.

     If it is, why are there old ads that advertise both games separately in the 
same ad. I have a screenshot from a mag of the title screen. I don't know if this is 
from before or after HS was released. I'll check.

    I wonder if Atari ever planned on putting out the Virtuality game "Dactyl 
Nightmare" for the VR headset. I wonder if there is any connection to this.

   If only the Jag could have gotten an enhanced port of "Michael Jordan in the 
Windy City" or "Shaq Fu" or "Scottie Pippin's Shut Up and Jam". We can always dream.

     In Next-Generation 4? there was an interview with Sam Tramial where he mentions 
this.

 NG: Most of the games on the Jaguar at this point have been PC ports, such as Theme 
Park and Syndicate. But there's nothing that is equivalent of Sega's Sonic or 
Nintendo's Mario. So far the Jaguar has failed to produce an..

Sam: ...the icon game, right. Our competitor 3DO, does not have an icon game. Sony 
does not have an icon game. But we think it is a nice thing to have an icon game. 
We're going to work on two or three different ideas at one time to see which one 
really takes hold. There's an old coin-op from the old Atari games called Major 
Havoc. It was a Tempest game from a technology point of view, with vector graphics. 
The game featured Major Havoc who goes out and saves a space station. He's a very 
cool character. We're going to modernize him and make him into an Atari character, 
bring him back from the 80's.   
       
               Woulda been another cool game. I wonder if this ever got beyond the 
planning stage.

         I remember when it was new in the arcades. I didn't like it then, don't 
like it now. I have it for the 7800. The only thing notable about it was the huge 
number of onscreen enemies. Sinistar is another game people rave about but I've 
played it recently and it's so not fun.
 I avoided all Williams games back then because they were all made way too hard and 
as a kid I didn't have tons of quarters to blow on games that lasted me 7 seconds. 
Joust and Defender are better on home systems  when you don't have to pay and 
Defender has usable controls as opposed the arcade machines controls but playing 
Robotron at home for free still doesn't seem any better. The only game that ever put 
me in the "Zone" was arcade Tempest, not Tempest 2000. The arcade Tempest is harder, 
you really have to concentrate. You can play Tempest 2000 totally drunk and do fine. 
Just catch a few power-ups and let the AI Droid come out and do the rest of the work 
for you.

I would/will very likely buy it.  It's an oddity.  And it's got to be a
more cost-effective purchase than "pre-ordering" two ICD CatBoxes for the
last flipping year!
