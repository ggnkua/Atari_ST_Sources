         DELAY:     (Sets time in 1/50 second increments before
                     BASIC resumes execution)

                 Use any desired value. If your WAVE command doesn't
         seem to be
                 working the way you think it should, try increasing
         this value.


         HOW TO USE THE WAVE COMMAND.

         First use the SOUND command to select the voice or voices
         desired, and Set
         the NOTE and OCTAVE values. Set the VOLUME and DURATION to 0.
         When using
         the WAVE command the VOLUME and DURATION values in the SOUND
         command are
         disabled. Next set the values for the WAVE command. As your
         program runs,
         the SOUND command will take on the parameters set in the WAVE
         command.
