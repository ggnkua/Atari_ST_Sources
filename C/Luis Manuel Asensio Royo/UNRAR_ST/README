    The unRAR utility is a freeware program, distributed with source
    code and developed for extracting, testing and viewing the
    contents of archives created with the RAR archiver, version 1.50
    and above.  For the usage and distribution license please read the
    file LICENSE.TXT.

    The unRAR utility is a minor part of the RAR archiver and contains
    RAR uncompression algorithm. UnRAR requires very small volume of
    memory to operate. THIS SOURCE CODE DIFFERS FROM THE DOS unRAR
    UTILITY, BECAUSE ALL OPTIMIZED ASM-ROUTINES PORTED IN C-CODE AND
    THERE ARE NO SWITCHES IMPLEMENTED.

    The unRAR utility does not depend upon the RAR environment
    variable or the configuration file RAR.CFG, for default options.

    The portable C source code of UNRAR contains files:

            UNRAR.C       Main code and functionality
            UNPACK.C      Unpacking procedures
            UNRAR.H       Definitions

    You should uncomment one of initial strings in UNRAR.H to define
    the Operating System you are using (generic DOS, OS/2, UNIX and
    Atari¿ TOS types are currently supported).

    Compile it using the Compact, Large or Huge memory model.

    You can define the optional macro SETFILETIME in UNRAR.H in order to
    allow UNRAR properly handle the time format of your operating media.
    The first argument of SETFILETIME is FILE *DestFile, and the second
    one - pointer to the DOS time structure. You can disable SETFILETIME
    by single ';' after the macro name.

    To build UNRAR executable you need to compile UNRAR.C module only.

    Usage:
            UNRAR <command> -<switches> <archive> <files...>

  e             Extract files to current directory
