Type BYTE must hold exactly 8 bits.  The code will collapse badly if BYTE is
anything other than exactly 8 bits. To avoid sign extension when casting
BYTE to a longer size, it must be declared unsigned.  For machine-
independence, Zoo does all I/O of archive headers and directory entries 
in units of BYTE.  The actual file data are not written in units of
BYTE, however, so portability may not be absolute.
