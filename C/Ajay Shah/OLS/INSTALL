What you need to install OLS:

	1. an ANSI C is essential.  Any ANSI C should be fine, but 
	I have only tried 
		- gcc on SPARC
		- Lucid C v2.0 for SPARC.

	2. a Unix-compatible make

What you do to install OLS:

1. Unpack the distribution archive in a clean directory.

2. Bring up Makefile in an editor.  At the top of the file
   are instructions for editing it.  You have to setup your C
   compiler and directory assumptions.

3. Now say

	make

   for a compile.

4. If all is well, say

	make test

   to have the behaviour of the executable tested against
   prestored results.  Small differences (because of differences
   in FP hardware) are ok, serious differences are not.

5. If you wish, say

	make install

   and it will copy files into destination directories.

   (In case you don't have a troff handy, the file ols.man
    contains a plaintext version of ols.1).


What you need to install epp2tex (optional!):

	any implementation of the new awk language (e.g., a recent GNU awk).

What you do to install epp2tex:

	1. Create a new directory with a name like ./EPP2TEX
	2. Go inside it and say
		/bin/sh ../epp2tex.shar
	3. Read the README and go on from there.
