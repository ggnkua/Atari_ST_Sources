	Estimation
	Post
	Processor


WHAT IS IT?
-----------

If you have typeset results of statistical estimation in LaTeX,
you know how painful it is.  This program makes it easier.

This is a LaTeX-generator for neatly typeset (tabular) results of 
statistical estimations.  It takes a easy-to-create file
describing the estimation results, and generates LaTeX.

Some limited facilities for customising the table are given.
Obviously, you can always take the generated LaTeX as a starting
point for your own editing.


The file epp-doc.tex is it's documentation.

The documentation contains examples of EPP at work.


DOES IT WORK ON YOUR MACHINE?
-----------------------------

Open Makefile and set the NEWAWK variable to point to your copy
of a new awk.  Set the CINIT variable too.

Say "make test".  It goes through some tests, and diffs the 
results against what is expected.  If the diffs fail, you know 
something is amiss.


MINIMAL FILES
-------------

The only file you need, after convincing yourself it works,
is epp2tex.nawk.
