OLS - A linear regression tool.  It generally should be executed from    
a CLI that permits redirection of input and output.                      

This is a fairly simple tool; it doesn't do a LOT of formatting.  It's   
very much in the UNIX tradition of small tools that can be "piped"       
together.                                                                

Compiled using GCC 2.3.3 and the MiNT libraries, Patchlevel 30.  It      
should work under both TOS and MiNT; I've only tested it under TOS.
