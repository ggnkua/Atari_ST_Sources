*IX SH style Regular Expressions
================================ 
 
The *IX command SH is a working shell similar in feel to the MSDOS
shell COMMAND.COM.  In point of fact much of what we see in our
familiar DOS PROMPT was gleaned from the early UNIX shells available
for many of machines the people involved in the computing arena had
at the time of the development of DOS and it's much maligned
precursor CP/M (although the UNIX shells were and are much more
flexible and powerful then those on the current flock of micro
machines).  The designers of DOS and CP/M did some fairly strange
things with their command processor and OS.  One of those things was
to only selectively adopt the regular expressions allowed within the
*IX shells.  Only '?' and '*' were allowed in filenames and even with
these the '*' was allowed only at the end of a pattern and in fact
when used to specify the filename the '*' did not apply to extension.
This gave rise to the all too common expression "*.*".

REGEX Globber is a SH pattern matcher.  This allows such
specifications as *75.zip or * (equivelant to *.* in DOS lingo).
Expressions such as [a-e]*t would fit the name "apple.crt" or
"catspaw.bat" or "elegant".  This allows considerably wider
flexibility in file specification, general parsing or any other
circumstance in which this type of pattern matching is wanted. 

A match would mean that the entire string TEXT is used up in matching
the PATTERN and conversely the matched TEXT uses up the entire
PATTERN. 

In the specified pattern string:
     `*' matches any sequence of characters (zero or more)
     `?' matches any character
     `\' suppresses syntactic significance of a special character
     [SET] matches any character in the specified set,
     [!SET] or [^SET] matches any character not in the specified set.

A set is composed of characters or ranges; a range looks like
'character hyphen character' (as in 0-9 or A-Z).  [0-9a-zA-Z_] is the
minimal set of characters allowed in the [..] pattern construct.
Other characters are allowed (ie. 8 bit characters) if your system
will support them (it almost certainly will).

To suppress the special syntactic significance of any of `[]*?!^-\',
and match the character exactly, precede it with a `\'.

output of MATCHTST.BAT


 
MATCH() and MATCHE()
====================

The match module as written has two parsing routines, one is matche()
and the other is match().  Since match() is a call to matche() which
simply has its output mapped to a BOOLEAN value (ie TRUE if pattern
matches or FALSE otherwise), I will concentrate my explanations here
on matche().

The purpose of matche() is to match a pattern against a string of
text (usually a file name or specification).  The match routine has
extensive pattern validity checking built into it as part of the
parser and allows for a robust pattern match.

The parser gives an error code on return of type int.  The error code
will be one of the the following defined values (defined in match.h):
 
    MATCH_PATTERN  - bad pattern or misformed pattern
    MATCH_LITERAL  - match failed on character match (standard
                     character)
    MATCH_RANGE    - match failure on character range ([..] construct)
    MATCH_ABORT    - premature end of text string (pattern longer
                     than text string)
    MATCH_END      - premature end of pattern string (text longer
                     than pattern called for)
    MATCH_VALID    - valid match using pattern

The functions are declared as follows:

    BOOLEAN match (char *pattern, char *text);

    int     matche(register char *pattern, register char *text);



IS_VALID_PATTERN() and IS_PATTERN()
===================================

There are two routines for determining properties of a pattern
string.  The first, is_pattern(), is designed simply to determine if
some character exists within the text which is consistent with a SH
regular expression (this function returns TRUE if so and FALSE if
not).  The second, is_valid_pattern() is designed to check the
validity of a given pattern string (TRUE return if valid, FALSE if
not).  By 'validity', I mean well formed or syntactically correct.

In addition, is_valid_pattern() has as one of it's parameters a
return code for determining the type of error found in the pattern if
one exists.  The error codes are as follows and defined in match.h:

    PATTERN_VALID - pattern is well formed
    PATTERN_ESC   - pattern has invalid literal escape ('\' at end of
                    pattern)
    PATTERN_RANGE - [..] construct has a no end range in a '-' pair
                    (ie [a-])
    PATTERN_CLOSE - [..] construct has no end bracket (ie [abc-g )
    PATTERN_EMPTY - [..] construct is empty (ie [])

The functions are declared as follows:

    BOOLEAN is_valid_pattern (char *pattern, int *error_type);

    BOOLEAN is_pattern (char *pattern);
