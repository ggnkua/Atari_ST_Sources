*******************************************************************************
* corrected draft!
* This is the assembler source for an VIQR compose table for CKBD
* (Mapping recommended by TriChlor group for Vietnamese: www.saigon.com)
* Modified from ISO_GER.CKB.S
*
* Should be set to switch to multi-character mode,
* Order sensitive.
*
* VIQR mapping would give problems in deadkey mode for English text
* because the "dd" sequence and "a." etc. would occur in English text.
* However, I think this isn't a problem in Vietnamese.
* (I might be wrong about this).
*
* -> Deadkey always translates double dead chars into a single one,
*    e.g. ' '  gives ', or with VIQR map: DD -> D
*
* Also the VIQR standard uses "\" as the compose key.. but I don't think
* we should stick with this.
*
* VIQR also requires literal to do things like question mark.
* I haven't added these to the table yet. but they require
* "\?" to be mapped to "?" etc.  ("\" is their literal character)
*
* VIQR also uses Ctrl-A (ascii 0x01) aka <CLS> for "Explicit Closure"
* to signal that no further characters belong to the current compose
* sequence.  Use ESC in CKBD instead!
*
*   This table was designed for the german keyboard layout!
*   To use with other keyboard layouts, select 'Table valid for Compose' in
*   the keyboard manager control panel.
