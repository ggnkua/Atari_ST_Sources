MANDBROT.PRG is a program which draws mandelbrot curves.  The program works
in low resolution only.

There are four main menu entries besides Quit.

Load         : This loads a picture that was previously saved by the program.
               If the new picture lies totally within the currently showing
               picture then its position will be shown.
Save         : This saves the currently showing picture to disk.
Enter Values : This allows the user to enter the low and high values for the
               real and imaginary coordinates.  It also allows the user to
               enter the maximum iteration value.  If this value is n*16+1
               then the center of the mandelbrot will be black.
               Once the values have been set then the user can select the
               slow or fast button.  The slow button calculates the value
               of every pixel in the screen.  The fast button gets about
               500 pixels out of the 60480 wrong but it does it about 3 times
               quicker than the slow button and the difference is not apparent
               to a human.
Select Area  : This allows the user to select an area of the currently
               showing picture.  It then calls "Enter Values" supplying
               the areas corresponding values.
