A hack is used to determine if "moonphse," "planet," "starst," or "staranim"
is running from the desktop or the shell.  If the environment variable "PATH"
is not set or has a null value, the program assumes it was run from the
desktop and will wait for a keypress before exiting.  If "PATH" is set, it
assumes it was run from a shell (since "PATH" is meaningless to the desktop)
and will usually exit immediately, the exception being "STARST.TTP" as
described in the readme file for the executables.

Two defines were added to starchart:  ST_MWC defines the Atari ST with the
Mark Williams C compiler, and INTERACTIVE means that the program must reset
the terminal before exiting, so the function die() is located in the driver
source file instead of in starchrt.c for better portability.

Really, very few changes were necessary.  A couple of frustrating bugs turned
out to be caused by Mark Williams C's definition of an "int" as 16 bits, which
caused very large numbers to become smaller, negative ones.  Casting them to
"long" solved the problem, but, as usual, fixing the problem was much easier
than finding it.

Names of programs were changed as follows because of the ST's MS-DOS-like file
structure:
     moonphase.c --> moonphse.c
     starchart.c --> starchrt.c
     starchart.h --> starchrt.h
     starimages.c --> starimag.c
     starlaser.c --> starlase.c

Be warned that compiling "planet" requires almost a full megabyte of memory.
With my 1040 I had to remove ALL desk accessories and AUTO folder programs,
and even then had to redirect the output of "make -n planet.ttp" into a file
and invoke it as a shell script, due to the overhead of running "make."

See the file "readme.2" for the readme files that were included with the
original distributions.

Obligatory Caveat:  I make no guarantees as to the robustness or accuracy of
this port of starchart.  While I am sure there are no devestating bugs in it,
should one appear I am not responsible for any damage or misinformation it
may cause.

All programs were compiled with Mark Williams C, version 3.0.6; portions of
these programs copyright 1984, Mark Williams Company.
