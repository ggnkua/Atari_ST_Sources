          These programs generate star charts based on data extracted
          from the Yale public domain star catalog.  Output is to the
          terminal (_s_t_a_r_d_s_p), Unix PIC file format (_s_t_a_r_p_i_c),
          PostScript format (_s_t_a_r_p_o_s_t), Unix Plot(5) format
          (_s_t_a_r_u_p_l_o_t), Tektronix vector format (_s_t_a_r_t_e_k), Silicon
          Graphics Iris format (_s_t_a_r_i_r_i_s), Hewlett-Packard terminal
          vector format (starhp) or in Hewlett-Packard Laserjet
          printer format (_s_t_a_r_l_a_s_e_r).

          Star data is optionally overlayed with other cosmic objects,
          such as planets.  If limiting magnitudes are properly set
          and the Messier database is available, Messier objects and
          some NGC objects are also printed.

          The starchart center is specified by two parameters: Right
          Ascension [0.00 to 24.00 hours] and Declination [-90.00 to
          +90.00 degrees].  An optional third parameter defines the
          N/S range of the output window, in degrees of declination.
          Digits after decimal point are taken as minutes:  object
          positions can therefore be taken directly from a star
          catalog.

          An optional fourth parameter gives a title.  This conforms
          to the 'old' Yale star chart format.  Two new parameters can
          be added after title, defining the magnitude limit and label
          printing magnitude limit.  These are discussed below.  All
          parameters can be given by using options, which offers more
          flexibility.  Parameters are:

          ----rrrr   Right ascension.

          ----dddd   Declination.

          ----ssss   Scale.

          ----tttt   Title. All these work as described above. Additional

               switches:

          ----mmmm   Star limiting magnitude. This sets limits on the
               faintest stars displayed on the ``master'' view.
               Default limits are device driver dependent (more
               below).  The ``thumbnail'' finder view is set to a
               related limit.

          ----llll   Label limiting magnitude. The new Yale database
               contains both a small set of familiar names (for stars
               and special objects), plus an extensive list of labels
               (Greek Bayer letter or Flamsteed numbers). Star names
               (including planet names) always print for this small
               set. To avoid clutter, the labels may be omitted below
               a cut-off magnitude by specifying this value.

          ----gggg   Greek/Flamsteed annotation magnitude. Labels printed
               for stars dimmer than this value will use a Bayer or
               numerical label in favor of a proper name.  The default
               (2.05) includes nearly all well-known proper names
               including Polaris, and excludes but a small number
               (such as Algol). Large values generate charts full of
               obscure Arabian names, small (zero or negative) values
               produce non-verbose charts, eg. ``a'', in Greek where
               possible, instead of ``Sirius''.

          ----cccc   A three or four character mnemonic follows, which is a
               search string for a matching line-item entry in the
               file _c_o_n._l_o_c_s.  If found, then the initial values for
               Ra, Decl, Scale and Title are taken from that file.
               Because the command line is parsed from left to right,
               subsequent switches might change the scale, title, or
               otherwise fine-tune the new defaults.

          ----ffff   A list of files follow, each containing ephemerides in
               the .star format, which will overlay the output. This
               is also useful for generating constellation boundaries,
               Milky Way isophots, and planet or satellite tracks.
               (The .star format additionally includes records for
               vector and text annotation). Files are processed
               sequentially. Thus, order may take on meaning for
               devices which provide a 2-1/2D page description, such
               as PostScript.

          ----bbbb   This switch provides a single full-page of output,
               without a thumbnail-sized finder chart. The legend
               placard is replaced with a single line banner giving
               title, right ascension, declination and limiting
               magnitude. This mode is useful for the construction of
               atlas pages. Because the page depicts the same vertical
               scale in degrees of declination, the output will cover
               a slightly reduced extent in right ascention.

          ----aaaa   This switch provides annotation-only (text) output: all
               stars and non-stellar objects are omitted (including
               objects normally rendered by using alpha characters).
               Borders and legends are left undisturbed. This feature
               is useful in separating output detail, as when making
               (color) overhead transparencies.

          ----oooo   This switch provides object-only output, and is the
               complement of the above switch. When both switches
               appear together, all output is displayed.  This
               resembles the default case (neither switch), except in
               that case object and annotation detail are written
               together. Here the software makes two consecutive
               passes through all datasets and arranges output detail
               to be written with all cosmic objects prefacing all
               related text annotations.  This is useful in providing
               data for PostScript files in which rendering happens in
               a 2-1/2D back-to-front order, thus providing for a
               cleaner overlaying of output.

          ----yyyy ----wwww ----pppp
               These switches allow for the redefinition of the files
               yale.star, messier.star and planet.star, respectively.

     OOOOUUUUTTTTPPPPUUUUTTTT
          The present implementations draw two viewports: a ``master''
          chart plus a ``thumbnail'' overview with low limiting
          magnitude.  Their location and the limiting magnitude is
          specified by records in the device driver, allowing the
          chart layout be tuned on a per-device basis.  In all cases,
          the output is annotated with viewport boundaries, a legend
          and axis labels. Variations are described for the ----aaaa ----oooo and
          ----bbbb switches, above.

          Objects are drawn in glyphs defined by each display driver.
          Vector-only devices rely on the parent module
          ``starimages.c'' to provide shape tables; other devices plot
          special characters (stardsp or starpic) or private symbols
          (PostScript). The latter additionally provides distinctions
          between object subclasses, e.g. planetary vs diffuse nebula.
          The code provides for this generally, creation of new
          glyphs.

          Sanson's sinusoidal projection is used to map coordinates.
          This projection preserves both area and linearity in
          Declination (y axis).  It gives good conformality (angle
          correctness) near the equator, so it is useful along the
          Ecliptic.  Lines of RA converge at the poles (unlike
          cylindrical projections), though Cassiopeia and the Dipper
          reproduce well.

          The present implementation expects _y_a_l_e._s_t_a_r sorted by
          decreasing magnitude so that output is sequential, and then
          cuts off below a limiting magnitude.  For more detailed
          charts spatial sorting might be more appropriate.  No cutoff
          is performed for other .star files.

          If <minutes> part of the parameters is greater than 59 it is
          silently truncated to 59.

          All .star file coordinates are for epoch E2000.0.  The
          Messier objects in _m_e_s_s_i_e_r._s_t_a_r were taken from precessed
          E1975.0 data.  The additional NGC objects were taken from
          data in the star atlas by _N_o_r_t_o_n and precessed from E1950.0.
          Descriptions and accurate magnitude values of all Messier
          objects were taken from the 1988 edition of the Royal
          Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) handbook.

          to enhance the software.
