Overview

The Yale Bright Star Catalog is an electronic catalog providing extensive
stellar information for the brightest stars. It is large (megabytes), and
includes extensive detail for each star (e.g. B-V color temperature, proper
motion, catalogue names), much of which is not needed by charting software.
It is normally distributed on magnetic tape, and has not (to my knowledge)
been posted to the net.

The highly reduced and hand-revised versions included with the "starchart"
software family have appeared in two forms. The first (~160K, posted February,
1987) included merely location, magnitude and familiar names for a small number
of stars. This recent reduction (~190K, posted October (?), 1987) adds spectral
designation for potential color applications, double and variable star
flags, Bayer and Flamsteed indices and increases the number of named stars.

The current dataset was reduced directly from the original Yale data by
Robert Tidd, using custom software. His file format is given below [1]. The
raw output was hand-edited by Alan Paeth to remove a number of anomolies [2].
Users wishing to update or extend yale.star should look in part [3].

064509-1643-99SDA1a CMASirius

Sirus has been reduced from mag -1.46 to -.99, owing to limitations in
the three character positions used to give magnitude. This may be rectified
by using the old style format (style is checked on a line and not a file basis),
but this would remove spectral information and identification.

! Notes on Magnitude
!
! Magnitudes on the range -9.9 through 9.99 are represented in the following
! format: "-99" though "999". Thus, the three position magnitude field is
! normally taken as mag*100, unless object is of negative magnitude, in which
! case it represents a value mag*10. This costs us the "hundredths" position
! for objects of negative magnitude, but this is not objectionable. For very
! dim objects, 9.99 represents the current limiting magnitude. As there are
! on the order of 1e6 stars to this brightness, the format provides adequate
! representation. When used to chart small asteroids or very dim non-stellar
! objects, magnitudes below +9.99 will occasionally be encountered; we suggest
! coding such entries as "999", with this value then taken to mean >=9.99.
!
! The old yale format which is supported for back compatability allows for
! a larger four digit field, but its use is not advocated, as code operation
! is not defined in presense of non-digits (such as leading blanks).

[f] Known Problems and "Features"

For certain double stars (when the companion is rather bright), duplicate
entries exist in the dataset, Ra and Dec values matching exactly. The
plotting of the second visible double star in an exact overstrike position
can cause problems, particularly with PostScript, which will inadvertently
form an annulus symbols which resembles the variable star indicator.

The fix is to remove all duplicate entries from yale.star which are exact
matches in RA and DECL, omitting those stars of lower value, while insuring
that the parent star has a "SD" (star double) indicator. 

This has been done to roughly seventy stars in the database, notibly to
Orion's belt and his Trapezium, and to Alpha Centaurii. The omitted entries
are included in "yale.omit". These remain useful for checking the combined
magnitudes of bright double stars, or in searching for pairs with striking
difference in star spectral class. The best known example of the latter in the
Northern Hemisphere is beta Cygnii [Alberio], but as the locations of both
companions differ by 2" in RA, the parent star of spectral class K5 is
represented, together with its B8 compainion.

[g] Bayer and Flamsteed numbers

A two character field represents Bayer letters, which by convention are
assigned as Greek lower case letters from alpha to omega, followed by
assignments in single and double digit Roman type. The database contains
entries such as " A" and "A " and "a ", and it is not always clear that the
lower case letter in the first column is an exact "trigger" for Greek fonts.
(Because entries such as "@" indicate a theta, and "E" also occurs).
In practice, this is not a problem unless one desires an authoratative code
for a quite dim star (ie, beyond the 24th Bayer assignment). For virtally all
stars given labels in standard Atlases, the StarChart output provides an exact
match.


[3] User Extentions to yale.star

Barring the correction of obvious errors in yale.star, users may wish to
add additional stars or ephemeride data in .star format. In any case, data
should be for the epoch E2000.0. The program "epoch" may be used if this is
not the case. The data records may be in either the new or old reduced
file format convention (planet.star still produces data in the old format).
The old format omits provision for spectral class or secondary label
information, but allow stars of magnitude at or below 10.0, as four (and not
three) characters are allocated to magnitude. Because testing of format is
done on a line-by-line basis, entries may be mixed and matched. Thus, the
present yale.star could be extended with data for dim, nameless stars below
magnitude 10. Note that yale.star must be sorted in order of decreasing
magnitude. This is only important for stellar data records.

For other cases, data produced in .star format may be included for printing
under the "-f file.star" option in the starcharting software. The important
fields are for Ra, Decl, Magnitude, Type (code and subcode) and name, as each
directly controls the location and appearence of the output. Two addition
record types have been added to facilitate general plotting (such as lunar
limb profiles or the ecliptic). The "I" type is an invisible object of some
specified magnitude and location which serves as a means to annotate output.
The "V" type is a vector object with subcodes "M", "S", "D", and "H" for move,
solid-draw, dot-draw and hyphen(dash)-draw. Annotations are ignored for vector
records, because the task of disentangling the intermingling of text and vector
commands to a large class of output devices is formidable. Again, magnitude
comes into play in performing clipping of objects too dim for display. A sample
file of these record types appears in "ephem.star"
