; This section is used to define priorities between
; Image Modules. There are 2 modules managed by VISION:
; 1: Internal modules (in VISION's prg file)
; 2: zView LDG modules
; 3: zView SLB modules
; Global defines a generic rule for all image formats
; You can define a specific case for a given format:
; <FMT>=<priorities>
; FMT is the file extension of the format (PI1 for Degas)
; Some examples:
; Global=2,1
; PNG=1,2
; --> Prefer zView for all but PNG
; You can also prevent using a module manage a format:
; Global=1,2
; PNG=2
; --> Prefer VISION internal image loader for all but PNG for which only zView LDG can load it
; By default VISION will prefer its own modules and fall back to zView plugin if not supported
