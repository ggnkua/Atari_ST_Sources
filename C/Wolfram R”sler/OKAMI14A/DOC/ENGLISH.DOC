@(#)	  OKAMI SHELL VERSION 1.4 - ENGLISH INSTRUCTIONS

	==================================================
			December 1st, 1991


The Okami Shell is a Unix-like CLI for the Atari ST. It should run on any
ST. 1 MB and harddisk are recommended, modem and mouse are optional.
It will run on all screen resolutions, although some commands require
lines to be at least 80 characters wide.

The Okami Shell resembles the Unix Bourne Shell (/bin/sh) and in
particular the AIX Shell found on the IBM RT 6150 computer system. Although
not completely compatible to the original, it gives the user much of
the comfort of the Unix interface.

The Okami Shell has some 100 built-in (internal) commands. They are all
listed in the file `help' which can be viewed with the command "help".
Pressing the HELP key after entering a command will display the
appropriate chapter from the file named by the shell variable HELPFILE.
(No english version yet, sorry)


SUPPORT

The Okami Shell is public domain. Everybody may possess, use, and distribute
it without profit. There are no shareware fees, although donations are
greately appreciated.
Hints and suggestions are always welcome. So are all errors you found in
the program and the documentation (including grammatical errors :)).

INSTALLATION

The shell doesn't require any installation except copying the okami
folder onto the hard disk or a diskette.
After starting, the shell executes the file `profile' in the current
directory as a shell script. So, you should tailor this file to suit
your needs.


STARTING

The shell can be started from the desktop by double-clicking on sh.ttp .
Any commands entered on the command line will be executed by the shell.
They may be introduced by `-c' which is ignored. Having executed these
commands, the shell will exit.
When a single `-' is passed as a parameter, the shell will execute the
file `profile' in the current directory.
It is recommended to start the shell with a `-' parameter using the
supplied msh.prg since there will be trouble running GEM programs from
the shell if it has been started as a ttp from desktop.

The shell installs itself in the _shell_p vector from where it can be
called by successive programs. The supplied file `system.c' demonstrates
how programs can call the shell this way, however any system() function
from C compiler libraries should work as well.


ENDING

The shell can be terminated by entering `exit' or pressing Ctrl-D.


RUNNING PROGRAMS

All executable programs can be started by the shell. However, some
shell variables have to be set:

	XEXT	must contain the extenders of all files that are to
		be considered binaries. The default is
		".prg,.tos,.ttp,.app".
	GEXT	must contain the extenders of all files that are to
		be started as GEM programs. The default is ".prg".
	PATH	must contain all directories (including drive id) that
		are to be searched for executable files.

So, if XEXT is ".prg,.ttp" and PATH is "c:/bin,$HOME/bin", after
typing "cmd", the shell will seek the files c:/bin/cmd.prg, c:/bin/cmd.ttp,
$HOME/bin/cmd.prg and $HOME/bin/cmd.ttp and execute the first file thus
found.
Arguments will be passed to started programs in the ordinary fashion
(basepage via Pexec) and using the xArg protocol. If xArg passing is
not desired, it can be switched off by typing "set -a".

Any file can be run as a (binary) program with the shell command `exec'.
So, typing `exec file.xyz' will run file.xyz regardless wether .xyz is
in $XEXT or not. If .xys is in $XEXT, file.xyz can be run by simply
typing `file'.


SHELL SCRIPTS

A shell script is an Ascii file containing shell commands. Lines beginning
with a # are interpreted as comments.
Shell scripts can be started just like binary programs. However, the
extenders of all files to be considered scripts must be stored in the
shell variable SEXT. The default is ".sh" which should do in most cases.
Any file can be run as a shell script by using the `.' command. I.e.,

. shscript.txt

will run the file shscript.txt as a shell script. Note: you must supply
the full filename and extender here, PATH and SEXT are not evaluated.


SHELL FUNCTIONS

A shell function simply is a shell script held in memory. Any file can be
loaded to make a shell function by typing:

cmd(filename)

this will load the named file and store it so that it can be called by
typing `cmd'. If cmd is ommited (i.e. by typing `(filename)'), the base
name of filename (without extender) will be used.
Example:

(showpic.sh)

will load the supplied file `showpic.sh' into memory, making a shell function
named "showpic".

Shell functions can be created by shell scripts or by typing from the keyboard
in the following manner:

name()
{
   ....................  any commands
}

Removing:

name()
{
}

or `unset name'.

The shell command `alias' can be used to create brief shell funktions. So,
`alias ll ls -l' will create a shell function named `ll' which executes
`ls -l' when called.

A list of all shell functions can be created with the internal command 'fcts'.


SHELL VARIABLES

...setting:
VAR=this is the value of VAR

...using:
echo The value of VAR is $VAR.
cat $HOME/profile

...protecting against value changes and deletion:
readonly VAR

...exporting into environment for successive programs:
export VAR

...listing:
vars

...removing:
VAR=""			(removes value)
VAR=			(removes variable)
unset VAR		(removes variable)

Type `ver -l' to find out the maximum number of shell variables.

Predefined shell variables:

PS1		The primary shell prompt.
PS2		The secondary shell prompt, used if additional input is
		required (e.g. when entering shell funktions).
OKAMISHELL	The shell's version number.
TERM		Initially set to "Atari ST" and not yet used any further.
CWD		The current directory, set by the cd command.
HOME		The current directory at the time the shell was started.
ETC		The name of a directory for additional files. Initially
		set to $HOME.
SHELL		Initially set to $HOME/sh.ttp . Should be changed if the
		name of the shell program file is changed.
PAGELEN 	The number of lines on the screen to be used by the more
		command. Initially set to 23.
PIPDIR		The name of a writable drive to be used for pipelining
		etc. Initially set to the same as HOME. Should be set
		in profile to be a ramdisk to speed things up.
NULL		The name of a file or device to which output is to be sent
		which has been redirected to the NULL: device. Initially
		set to PRN: but can be set to a ramdisk file.
XEXT		
SEXT
GEXT
PATH
		explained above.
CDPATH		A list of directories to be searched by the cd command.
MANPATH		A list of directories to be searched by the man command.
MANEXT		A list of file extenders to be recognized as online-help
		text files for external commands, used by the man command.
HELPFILE	The name of the online help file for internal commands.
		Should be set to $HOME/doc/english.doc in profile since
		the default is $HOME/doc/commands.doc (the german instructions
		file).
CLIPDIR		Contains the directory and file of the AES scrap directory.
		Should only be set by the `clipb' command.
