 Commands with optional file (eg. hd [file]) take StdIn if no file is given.


 Extended Wildcards:
 *	matches anything
 ?	matches one character
 [xyz]	matches x, y, or z
 [x-z]	matches x, ..., z
 [~xy]	matches any character except x and y

 Conditional execution:
 if command		Executes commands1 if command returns a non-zero
 then			exit value and commands2 if command returns a
   commands1		zero exit value. "else command2" may be ommitted.
 else			command can be "test expr" or "[ expr ]" (see
   commands2		"test").
 fi			This works with shell scripts and in interactive
			mode.

 Looping:
 while command		Executes commands2 until command returns a zero
 do			exit value. break may be used within an if-fi-
   commands2		construct and quits the loop immediately.
   <may include:>	continue may be used within an if-fi-contruct and
   break <or>		starts a new loop immediately.
   continue		This works with shell scripts (and functions) only.
 done

 Function deklaration:
 functionname(filename) generates "functionname" from file
 (filename)		generates `basename filename` from file
 functioname()		generates "functionname" with the given
 {			commands
   commands...
 }
 functionname() 	removes the named function
 {}

 `filename' may be a shell script or executable program file.
 

 I/O redirection:
 <			redirect StdIn
 >			redirect StdOut, create
 >>			redirect StdOut, append
 n>			redirect File-Descr. n, create (n=2: StdErr)
 n>>			redirect File-Descr. n, append (n=2: StdErr)
 |			pipe
 <<[-]eofstring		inline document
