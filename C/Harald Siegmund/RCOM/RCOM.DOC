   =============================================================================
   1. What is a resource compiler?

   RCOM is a utility which converts GEM resource files to linkable object files
   (DRI format), which can be included into your programs. The locations of the
   pointers in the resource will be written to the relocation table of the
   object file, so the resource will automatically be relocated after is has
   been loaded into memory. RCOM is called the following way:

   rcom resource_file object_file

   For example, the following call will compile the resource 'demo.rsc' to
   the object file 'demo.o':

   rcom demo.rsc demo.o


   =============================================================================
   2. Files on the disk

   The RCOM disk/folder/whatever should contain the following files:

   RCOM.TTP          the resource compiler
   RCOM.C            source of the resource compiler
   RCOM.DOC          the file you are just reading

   LIB\RSRC.C        source of resource handler
   LIB\RSRC.O        resource handler as object file

   DEMO\DEMO.C       the source of a small demonstration program
   DEMO\DEMORSC.DFN  definition file (DRI RCS 2.1) of its resource
   DEMO\DEMORSC.H    C header file of its resource
   DEMO\DEMORSC.RSC  the demo resource in the standard RSC format


   =============================================================================
   3. Using compiled resources in your own programs

   Link the compiled resource and the file RSRC.O (which can be found in the
   LIB folder) to your application. That's all! The module RSRC.O replaces the
   AES resource-library functions. The C source of RSRC.O can be found in
   LIB\RSRC.C. RSRC.O was created using the Pure C development package.


   =============================================================================
   4. Notes for users of the Interface resource editor

   The resource compiler accepts the long resource format created by Interface
   (resources > 64K). However the object indices passed to the functions in
   RSRC.C are still of type 'int' (which is 16 bit in Pure C). You'll have to
   modify RSRC.C if you want to deal around with very large resources (with
   more than 32767 structures of one type, e.g. more that 32767 TEDINFOs).
