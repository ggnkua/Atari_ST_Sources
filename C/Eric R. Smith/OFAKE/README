A number of people have mentioned that it's a shame that MiNT 0.9's
universal drive (drive U:) isn't accessible from Neodesk or
from the TOS 1.0 desktop. So, here's a quick hack to allow
another drive letter to be a universal drive. Move the
file OFAKE.XFS to the root directory of your MiNT 0.9 boot disk
(or to the same directory as MINT.PRG, if you don't boot
with MiNT) and the next time you start MiNT, drive O: will
also function as a universal drive (it will be equivalent
in all respects to drive U:). If O: isn't a convenient letter,
rename the file (e.g. if it's called HFAKE.XFS, the fake
universal drive will be drive H:). Drive U: will still exist
as well as whatever fake drive you install.

NOTE: This won't work with versions of MiNT prior to 0.9, which
never try to load .XFS files.

DISCLAIMER: Use this at your own risk. I haven't tested it very
thoroughly -- it seems to work OK, but who knows, some programs
may get very, very upset at the thought of a "drive" that isn't
a real BIOS device. This program is public domain, and hence
has NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.
