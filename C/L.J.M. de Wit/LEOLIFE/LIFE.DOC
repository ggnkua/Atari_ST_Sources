   NAME
      life   - the game of life (graphics demo if you want)
  
   SYNTAX
      life.ttp [-d|-D] [-w wait] [01-pattern ...]
  
   DESCRIPTION
      This program barely needs comments. 'Generations' are created on a grid,
      on a step by step basis. The criterium used for a cell to survive
      (resp. die), is that it has between BOT (3) and TOP (4) neighbours
      (resp. has not).
  
      The program runs only in high and medium resolution modes (so everyone
      should be able to run it); not supporting low res is entirely due to
      laziness on my part 8-), but since no colours are involved (yet) it
      seemed an unnecessary addition.
  
      For both resolutions supported you can choose a coarse grid (25 x 40)
      and a fine one (50 x 80); default is coarse, and the -d or -D (double)
      option selects the fine grid.
  
      The -w or -W option lets you specify an amount of time to wait between
      generations (default is nowait).
  
      Any remaining arguments are taken to be the initial patterns to be placed
      on the grid, a '0' representing an empty cell, a '1' a filled one. These
      patterns are placed on subsequent rows, near the middle of the screen.
      Some pattern sets generate repetitive populations, other die away, still
      other generate nice ever-changing patterns. Experiment. Symmetric sets
      are (possibly) favorite; this means using symmetric patterns, with the
      first matching the last, the second the last but one, etc., and using an
      odd number of patterns in the coarse grid case and an even number of
      patterns in the fine grid case. You could alternative use point symmetry
      instead of line symmetry; figure out for yourself how to arrange this.
      If there are no remaining arguments after any flags, a random pattern is
      generated.
  
      To finish the game, 'press any key ...'
  
   EXAMPLE
      life -d -w 20 011110 110011 101101 001100 101101 110011 011110
  
      will have a fine grid, a wait pause of 20, and an initial pattern set
      that looks like:

                                   * ** *
                                     **

                                    ****
   DECISIONS
      Screen access is done directly, for speed reasons (we must be able to
      print several hundreds of characters, several times per second, if we
      want screen updates to appear - almost - immediate).
      On the other hand, C proved to be quite fast enough, so there was no
      need to resort to assembler.
      Each resolution and each mode (coarse/fine) demands it own treatment,
      so four separate (functional identical) functions were written, one
      for each of them.
