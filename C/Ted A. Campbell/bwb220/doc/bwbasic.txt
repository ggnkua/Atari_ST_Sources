   The author wishes to express his thanks to Mr. David MacKenzie, 
   who assisted in the development Unix installation and configuration
   for this version.


1. DESCRIPTION

   The Bywater BASIC Interpreter (bwBASIC) implements a large
   superset of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978)
   and a significant subset of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC
   (X3.113-1987) in C. It also offers shell programming facilities
   as an extension of BASIC. bwBASIC seeks to be as portable
   as possible.

   bwBASIC can be configured to emulate features, commands, and
   functions available on different types of BASIC interpreters;
   see the file INSTALL for further installation information.

   The interpreter is fairly slow.  Whenever faced with a choice
   between conceptual clarity and speed, I have consistently chosen
   the former.  The interpreter is the simplest design available,
   and utilizes no system of intermediate code, which would speed
   up considerably its operation.  As it is, each line is interpreted
   afresh as the interpreter comes to it.

   bwBASIC implements one feature not available in previous BASIC
   interpreters: a shell command can be entered interactively at the
   bwBASIC prompt, and the interpreter will execute it under a
   command shell.  For instance, the command "dir *.bas" can be
   entered in bwBASIC (under DOS, or "ls -l *.bas" under UNIX) and
   it will be executed as from the operating system command line.
   Shell commands can also be given on numbered lines in a bwBASIC
   program, so that bwBASIC can be used as a shell programming
   language. bwBASIC's implementation of the RMDIR, CHDIR, MKDIR,
   NAME, KILL, ENVIRON, and ENVIRON$() commands and functions
   offer further shell-processing capabilities.

4. GENERAL NOTES ON USAGE:

   4.a. Interactive Environment

   An interactive environment is provided if the flag INTERACTIVE
   is defined as TRUE in bwbasic.h, so that a line with a
   line number can be entered at the bwBASIC prompt and it will be
   added to the program in memory.

   Line numbers are not strictly required, but are useful if the
   interactive enviroment is used for programming.  For longer
   program entry one might prefer to use an ASCII text editor, and
   in this case lines can be entered without numbers. One can use
   DO NUM and DO UNNUM to number or unnumber lines. See also the
   documentation below for the pseudo-command EDIT.

   4.b. Naming Conventions

   Command names and function names are not case sensitive,
   so that "Run" and "RUN" and "run" are equivalent and "abs()"
   and "ABS()" and "Abs()" are equivalent. HOWEVER, variable
   names ARE case sensitive in bwbASIC, so that "d$" and "D$"
   are different variables.  This differs from some BASIC
   implementations where variable names are not case sensitive.

   Variable names can use any alphabetic characters, the period
   and underscore characters and decimal digits (but not in the
   first position). They can be terminated with '#' or '!' to
   allow Microsoft-type names, even though the precision is
   irrelevant to bwBASIC.

   4.c. Numerical Constants

   Numerical constants may begin with a digit 0-9 (decimal), with
   the "&H" or "&h" (hexadecimal) or the "&o" or "&O" (octal).
   Decimal numbers may terminated with 'E', 'e', 'D', or 'd'
   followed by an exponent number to denote exponential notation.
   Decimal constants may also be terminated by the '#' or '!'
   to comply with Microsoft-style precision terminators, although
   the precision specified will be irrelevant to bwBASIC.

   4.d. Command-Line Execution

   A filename can be specified on the command line and will be
   LOADed and RUN immediately, so that the command line

      bwbasic prog.bas

   will load and execute "prog.bas".

   4.e. Program Storage

   All programs are stored as ASCII text files.

   4.f. TRUE and FALSE

   TRUE is defined as -1 and FALSE is defined as 0 in the default
   distribution of bwBASIC. These definitions can be changed by
   those compiling bwBASIC (see file BWBASIC.H).

   4.g. Assignments

   Assignment must be made to variables.  This differs from some
   implementations of BASIC where assignment can be made to a
   function.  Implication: "INSTR( 3, x$, y$ ) = z$" will not
   work under bwBASIC.

   4.h. Operators and Precedence

   bwBASIC recognizes the following operators, with their level
   of precedence given (1 = highest):

      ^ 		1 	exponentiation
      *			2 	multiplication
      /			2	division
      \			3 	integer division
      +			5 	addition
      -			5 	subtraction
      =			6 	equality or assignment
      MOD		4	modulus (remainder) arithmetic
      <>		7	inequality
      <			8	less than
      >			9	greater than
      <=		10	less than or equal to
      =<		10	less than or equal to
      >=		11	greater than or equal to
      =>		11	greater than or equal to
      NOT		12	negation
      AND		13	conjunction
      OR		14	disjunction
      XOR		15	exclusive or
      IMP		16	implication
      EQV		17	equivalence

   4.h. Numerical Precision (NOT)

   bwBASIC utilizes numbers with only one level of precision. If
   the flag NUMBER_DOUBLE is defined as TRUE in bwbasic.h, the
   precision implemented will be that of the C "double" data type;
   otherwise (default) the precision will be that of the C "float"
   type.  At a number of points there are commands (or pseudo-
   commands) that seem to recognize Microsoft-style precision
   distinctions, but for the most part these are just work-around
   aliases to allow Microsoft-style programs to be run.


5. EXPANDED REFERENCE FOR COMMANDS AND FUNCTIONS

   The "Dependencies" listed in the folowing reference materials
   refers to flags that must be set to TRUE in bwbasic.h for the
   associated command or function to be implemented.  These flags
   are as follows:

   			bwBASIC; these are the ANSI Minimal BASIC core

   INTERACTIVE		Commands supporting the interactive programming
   			environment

   COMMON_CMDS		Commands beyond ANSI Minimal BASIC which are common
   			to Full ANSI BASIC and Microsoft BASICs

   COMMON_FUNCS		Functions beyond the ANSI Mimimal BASIC core, but
   			common to both ANSI Full BASIC and Microsoft-style
   			BASIC varieties

   UNIX_CMDS		Commands which require Unix-style directory and
   			environment routines not specified in C

   STRUCT_CMDS		Commands related to structured programming; all
   			of these are part of the Full ANSI BASIC standard

   ANSI_FUNCS		Functions unique to ANSI Full BASIC

   Implenentation-Specific Notes:

   CVD(), CVI(), CVS(), MKI$(), MKD$(), MKS$(): These functions
   are implemented, but are dependent on a) the sizes for integer,
   float, and double values on particular systems, and b) how
   particular versions of C store these numerical values. The
   implication is that data files created using these functions
   on a DOS-based microcomputer may not be translated correctly
   by bwBASIC running on a Unix-based computer.  Similarly, data
   files created by bwBASIC compiled by one version of C may not be
   readable by bwBASIC compiled by another version of C (even under
   the same operating system). So be careful with these.

   Dependencies: MS_FUNCS

   Function:     CVI( string$ )

   Description:  CVI converts the argument string$ into a bwBASIC
                 number (precision is irrelevant in bwBASIC since

                 As implemented under bwBASIC, DATE$ cannot be used for
                 assignment (i.e., to set the system date).

   Note:	 bwBASIC presently (v2.10) does not allow assignment
		 to a function.

   Dependencies: COMMON_FUNCS

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      DEF FNname(arg...)] = expression

   Description:  DEF defines a user-written function.  This function
                 corresponds to Microsoft-type implementation, although

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      DELETE line[-line]

   Description:  DELETE deletes program lines indicated by the
                 argument(s). If you want to use DELETE for non-
                 numbered programs, first use DO NUM, then DELETE,
                 then DO UNNUM.

   Dependencies: INTERACTIVE

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      DIM variable(elements...)[variable(elements...)]...

   Description:  DIM specifies variables that have more than one
                 element in a single dimension, i.e., arrayed
                 variables.

   Note:         As implemented under bwBASIC, DIM accepts only
                 parentheses as delimiters for variable fields.
                 (Some BASICs allow the use of square brackets.)

   Dependencies: (core)

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      DO NUM|UNNUM

   Description:  DO NUM numbers all lines in a program.  The first
                 line is given the number 10, and subsequent lines
                 are numbered consecutively in multiples of 10. DO
                 UNNUM removes all line numbers from a program.
                 NOTE that these functions do nothing to line
                 numbers, e.g., following a GOSUB or GOTO statement;
                 these commands cannot be used as a replacement for
                 RENUM (available in some systems, but not bwBASIC).
                 With these commands, however, one can develop
                 unnumbered programs by entering new lines with numbers,
                 then running DO UNNUM to remove the line numbers.
                 Together with LOAD and SAVE (q.v.) one can use
                 bwBASIC as a primitive text editor.

   Dependencies: INTERACTIVE

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      DO [WHILE expression]

   Description:  DO implements a number of forms of program loops.
                 DO...LOOP simply loops; the only way out is by
                 EXIT; DO WHILE...LOOP loops while "expression" is
                 true (this is equivalent to the older WHILE-WEND
                 loop, also implemented in bwBASIC); DO...LOOP UNTIL
                 loops until the expression following UNTIL is true.

   Dependencies: STRUCT_CMDS

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      EDIT

   Description:  EDIT is a pseudo-command which calls the text editor
                 specified in the variable BWB.EDITOR$ to edit the

   Command:      ENVIRON variable-string$ = string$

   Description:  ENVIRON sets the environment variable identified by
                 variable-string$ to string$.

                 It might be noted that this differs from the implementation
                 of ENVIRON in some versions of BASIC, but bwBASIC's ENVIRON
                 allows BASIC variables to be used on either side of the equals
                 sign.  Note that the function ENVIRON$() is different from the
                 command, and be aware of the fact that in some operating systems
                 an environment variable set within a program will not be passed
                 to its parent shell.

   Function:     ERR

   Description:  ERR returns the error number of the most recent error.

                 Note that if PROG_ERRORS has been defined when bwBASIC is
                 compiled, the ERR variable will not be set correctly upon
                 errors.  It only works when standard error messages are used.

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      ERROR number

   Description:  ERROR simulates an error, i.e., displays the message
                 appropriate for that error. This command is helpful
                 in writing ON ERROR GOSUB routines that can identify
                 a few errors for special treatment and then ERROR ERR
                 (i.e., default handling) for all others.

                 specified in the variable BWB.FILES$ with the argument
                 filespec$.  Normally, the user must set this variable
                 before FILES can be used.  E.g., for PC-type computers,

                    BWB.FILES$ = "DIR"

                 will work, for Unix machines,

   Command:      FUNCTION

   Description:  FUNCTION introduces a function definition, normally
                 ending with END FUNCTION.  In bwBASIC, FUNCTION and
                 DEF are qorking equivalents, so either can be used
                 with single-line function definitions or with multi-
                 line definitions terminated by END FUNCTION.

   ------------------------------------------

   Command:      INPUT [# device-number]|[;]["prompt string";]list of variables

   Description:  INPUT allows input from the terminal or a device
                 specified by device-number.  If terminal, the "prompt
                 string" is output, and input is assigned to the
                 appropriate variables specified.

                 bwBASIC does not support the optional feature of INPUT
                 that suppresses the carriage-return and line-feed at the end
                 of the input.  This is because C alone does not provide for any
                 means of input other than CR-LF-terminated strings.

   Description:  LINE INPUT reads entire line from the keyboard or a file
                 or device into string-variable$.  If input is from the
                 keyboard (stdin), then "prompt string" will be printed
                 first.  Unlike INPUT, LINE INPUT reads a whole line,
                 not stopping for comma-delimited data items.

   Function:     MKD$( number )

   Description:  MKD$, MKI$, and MKS$ are all equivalent in bwBASIC.
                 They convert the numerical value 'number' into a string
                 which can be stored in a more compressed form in a file
                 (especially for random file access).  Since bwBASIC does
                 not recognize differences in precision, these commands
                 are effectively equivalent.

   Description:  OPEN allocates random access memory for access to a disk
                 file or other device.  Note that two quite different forms
                 of the OPEN statement are supported. In the first form,
                 "O" (note that these letters must be encased in quotation
                 marks) denotes sequential output, "I" denotes sequential
                 input, and "R" denotes random-access input and output.

   Description:  PRINT outputs text to the screen or to a file or device
                 specified by device-number. In the current implementation
                 of bwBASIC, expressions to be printed must be separated by
                 the comma (tabbed output), the semicolon (immediate
                 sequential output) or the plus sign (immediate sequential
                 output by string concatenation).  Expressions separated
                 by blanks or tabs are not supported. If USING is specified,
                 a number of formatting marks may appear in the format
                 string:

                    !	prints the first character of a string

                    \\	prints 2+x characters of a string, where x =

                    .	decimal point in a number

                    +	sign of a number (will output + or -)

                    -	trailing minus after a number

                    **	fill leading spaces with asterisks

                    $$	output dollar sign in front of a number

                    ^^	output number in exponential format

                    _	output next character literally

                 As currently implemented, the exponential format

                 to find a segment delimiter (":") followed by another
                 line segment with command.  bwBASIC does not currently
                 implement the Microsoft-style use of the single quotation
                 mark to denote remarks.

6. PREDEFINED VARIABLES

   BWB.EDITOR$
   BWB.FILES$
   BWB.PROMPT$
   BWB.IMPLEMENTATION$

   The commands EDIT and FILES are pseudo-commands that launch
   shell programs named in the variables BWB.EDITOR$ and BWB.FILES$,
   respectively.  The default values for these variables can
   be changed in bwbasic.h (DEF_EDITOR and DEF_FILES), or they
   can be changed on the fly by the user.  An idea might be to
   initialize these variables in "profile.bas" for specific
   implementations; for instance, BWB.FILES$ might be defined as
   "ls -l" on Unix systems or "dir" on DOS systems.

   The preset variable BWB.PROMPT$ can be used to set the prompt
   string for bwBASIC.  Again, it is suggested that a user-
   selected promptcan be set up in a "profile.bas" to be
   initialized each time bwBASIC starts.  Note that special
   characters can be added to the prompt string, e.g.,

      BWB.PROMPT$ = "Ok"+CHR$(10)

   will give an "Ok" prompt followed by a linefeed.

   The preset variable BWB.IMPLEMENTATION$ will return "TTY" for
   the bwx_tty implementation and will return "IQC" for the
   IBM PC or Compatibles with QuickC (bwx_iqc) implementation.
   This may be useful in determing which commands and functions
   (specifically CLS, LOCATE, and INKEY$) may be available. 


7. UNIMPLEMENTED COMMANDS AND FUNCTIONS, and AGENDA FOR DEVELOPMENT

   There are some items not implemented that have been so long
   a part of standard BASICs that their absence will seem surprising.
   In each case, though, their implementation would require opera-
   ting-system-specific functions or terminal-specific functions
   that cannot be universally provided. Some specific examples:

   CLOAD	Relies on CP/M or MSDOS conventions for binary
                executable files. 

   CONT		See RESUME below (programmer ignorance?).

   DEF USR	Relies on CP/M or MSDOS conventions for binary
                executable files. 

   FRE()	The ability to report the amount of free memory
		remaining is system-specific due to varying patterns
		of memory allocation and access; consequently this
		ability is not present in ANSI or earlier versions 
                of C and this function is not available in bwBASIC.

   INPUT$()	C by itself is not able to read unechoed keyboard 
		input, and can read keyboard input only after a 
		Carriage-Return has been entered.

   INP		Calls to hardware ports, like machine-language
   		routines, are highly system-specific and cannot
   		be implemented in C alone.

   LLIST	See LPRINT below.

   LPOS		See LPRINT below.

   LPRINT	and LLIST, etc., require access to a printer device,
   		and this varies from one system to another. Users
   		might try OPENing the printer device on their own
   		operating system (e.g., "/dev/lp" on Unix systems,
   		or "PRN" under DOS) and see if printing can be done
   		from bwBASIC in this way.

   NULL		In this case, I am convinced that NULL is no longer
		necessary, since very few printers now require NULLs
		at the end of lines.

   OUT		See INP above (calls to hardware ports).

   PEEK()	PEEK and POKE enabled earlier BASICs to address
   		particular memory locations. Although bwBASIC
   		could possibly implement this command (POKE) and
   		this function (PEEK()), the limitation would be
   		highly limited by the different systems for
   		memory access in different systems.

   POKE		see PEEK() above.

   RENUM	Since unnumbered lines can be entered and
   		executed under bwBASIC, it would not be
   		possible to implement a RENUM routine.
   		Instead, bwBASIC uses DO NUM and DO UNNUM.

   RESUME	Is this possible under C? If so, I
   		simply have failed to figure it out yet.
   		Mea culpa (but not maxima).

   USR		See CALL and DEF USR above (machine language
   		subroutines).

   VARPTR	See PEEK and POKE above.

   WAIT		See INP and OUT above.

   There are other commands, functions, and implementation details
   that I am working on, and which are on the agenda list for future
   versions of bwBASIC.  These agenda include:

   PARACT	i.e., the ability to execute PARallel ACTions. This
   		is described in ANSI BASIC, although I have not seen it
   		implemented before.  It will offer a rough, non-
   		preemptive form of multitasking within the scope
   		of a BASIC program. Programmers will note points at which
   		there are already hooks for PARACT in bwBASIC.

   XMEM		PC-type computers need to be able to use extended
   		memory.  If we could use extended memory for program
   		lines, variables, and function defitions, we could
   		write much longer programs.  This would entail,
   		however, a fairly serious rewriting of the program
   		to utilize memory handles for these storage features
   		instead of direct memory pointers.

   Windows	The addition of memory handles in addition to the
   		non-preemptive execution of program lines (in a
   		crude form, already present) will make it possible
   		to develop implementations for Windows and perhaps
   		for other graphical user interfaces.  But what form
   		should this take?  I have in mind presently a BASIC
   		that would run in the background, appearing only
   		as an icon in the GUI space, with pop-up editors
   		and output windows. Thus, the interpreted language
		would serve a purpose something like 'cron' (a task
		scheduler) under Unix systems. You may have some
		reflections that would help me in this.

   Graphics	Here we face fairly critical differences in different
   		styles and implementations of graphics, e.g., between
   		GWBASIC, ANSI BASIC, VisualBASIC, etc. But it's
   		possible that Graphics commands and functions could
   		be added. These would all be implementation-specific.

   The ANSI Standard for full BASIC does not specify which particular
   commands or functions must be implemented, and in fact the standard
   is very robust.  Perhaps no implementation of BASIC would ever
   include all of the items, but some ANSI commands and functions which
   remain unimplemented are:

   ANGLE
   AREA
   ARITHMETIC

8. THE STORY OF BYWATER BASIC

   This program was originally begun in 1982 by my grandmother, Mrs.
   Verda Spell of Beaumont, TX.  She was writing the program using
   an ANSI C compiler on an Osborne I CP/M computer and although my
   grandfather (Lockwood Spell) had bought an IBM PC with 256k of
   RAM my grandmother would not use it, paraphrasing George Herbert
   to the effect that "He who cannot in 64k program, cannot in 512k."
   She had used Microsoft BASIC and although she had nothing against
   it she said repeatedly that she didn't understand why Digital
   Research didn't "sue the socks off of Microsoft" for version 1.0
   of MSDOS and so I reckon that she hoped to undercut Microsoft's
   entire market and eventually build a new software empire on
   the North End of Beaumont. Her programming efforts were cut
   tragically short when she was thrown from a Beaumont to Port
   Arthur commuter train in the summer of 1986. I found the source
   code to bwBASIC on a single-density Osborne diskette in her knitting
   bag and eventually managed to have it all copied over to a PC
   diskette. I have revised it slightly prior to this release. You
   should know, though, that I myself am an historian, not a programmer.
