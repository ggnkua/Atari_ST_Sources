3D2-POV Converter Version 1.8 Apr/93
Copyright (c) 1993 by Steve Anger

This program converts .3D2 files generated by the Atari programs CAD-3D and
Cyber CAD to POV-Ray or Vivid raytracer scene files. Bounding shapes are
automatically generated for POV-Ray to greatly reduce the rendering time.


Hardware requirements:

Two version of the executable are included in this archive, 3D2-POV.EXE and
3D2-POVX.EXE. The first version will run on all machines from XT's to 486's
but is only capable of using 640k of memory. The second version requires a
minimum of a 386 with a co-pro to run but can use all available memory plus
up to 128M of virtual memory. It is compatible with most 386 memory managers
but will not run under a DPMI server (Windows, OS/2).


Syntax:  3d2-pov inputfile[.3d2] [outputfile] [options]

Options:
-snnn    - Generates smooth triangles. The boundaries between triangles
           are only smoothed if the angle between the triangles is less
           that nnn degrees. -s0 will not smooth any triangles while
           -s180 will smooth all triangles. Values from -s45 to -s90
           usually work well. If unspecified smoothing defaults to -s60.

-op      - Output to POV-Ray 1.0 format (default)
-op2     - Output to POV-Ray 2.0 format (2.0 is unreleased as yet)
-ov      - Output to Vivid 2.0 format
-or      - Output to Raw triangle format.

-lxnnn   - Set look_at x coord to nnn
-lynnn   -  '     '    y   '   '   '
-lznnn   -  '     '    z   '   '   '

-vxnnn   - Set view_point x coord to nnn
-vynnn   -  '       '     y   '   '   '
-vznnn   -  '       '     z   '   '   '
