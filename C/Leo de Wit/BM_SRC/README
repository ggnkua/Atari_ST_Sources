Bm is a fast pattern matching utility, intended to be almost
identical in functionality to fgrep (ugh!) but much faster. It uses
the Boyer-Moore algorithm, as described in the papers listed below:

Matching Algorithm",

*** NOTE *** There are certain system dependencies in the code.
Please check whether your system uses "index" or "strchr" to
find a character in a string: this affects MkDescVec.c.
Also check whether your system uses <strings.h> or <string.h>.
This affects match.c/bm.c, MkDescVec.c, and PrintLine.c.
Also check whether your system has "bcopy". If so, see MoveResidue.c

The files are MkDescVec.c, PrintLine.c, bm.c, and 
Execute.c: search a file for the patterns
Extern.h: declarations of externs
GetPatFile.c: read in patterns from a file and set up a vector of
	pattern descriptors
Global.c: global variables (complement to Extern.h)
MakeDesc.c: create a pattern descriptor for one pattern, including
	skip tables, etc.
MakeSkip.c: make the skip tables for one pattern
Makefile: you can figure this one out for yourself
MatchFound.c: what to do when you actually FIND a pattern - print it,
	update flags, etc.
MkDescVec.c: make a vector of pattern descriptors, given a string
	of newline-separated patterns
MoveResidue.c: when you come to the end of the buffer, move the
	unsearched "residue" to the beginning and start again
PrintLine.c: print the appropriate stuff after finding a match
PutUsage.c: mini-man page.
README: this file
Search.c: the guts. Implements B-M algorithm given a pattern, skip
	tables for the pattern, and a buffer to search
bm.c: mainline. mostly interpreting the command line and tidying
	up at the end. Calls Execute for each file.
bm.h: constants
bm.p: man page
