Files marked "required*" are also needed to compile fUnZip.  The normal
unzip makefile targets now make both unzipsfx and funzip, except in a few 
cases; zipinfo is now incorporated into unzip (and invoked with unzip's 
-Z option or by linking/renaming the executable to "zipinfo[.exe]" or 
"ii[.exe]").
