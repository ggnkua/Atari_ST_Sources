NAME
     unzip - list, test and extract compressed  files  in  a  ZIP
     archive

SYNOPSIS
     unzip [-Z] [-cflptuvz[ajnoqsCLV$]] file[.zip]  [file(s) ...]
     [-x xfile(s) ...] [-d exdir]

DESCRIPTION
     unzip will list, test, or extract files from a ZIP  archive,
     commonly  found  on  MS-DOS  systems.   The default behavior
     (with no options) is to extract into the  current  directory
     (and  subdirectories  below it) all files from the specified
     ZIP archive.  A  companion  program,  zip(1L),  creates  ZIP
     archives; both programs are compatible with archives created
     by PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but in many  cases
     the program options or default behaviors differ.

ARGUMENTS
     file[.zip]
          Path of the ZIP archive(s).  If the file  specification
          is  a  wildcard,  each matching file is processed in an
          order determined by the operating system (or file  sys-
          tem).   Only  the  filename can be a wildcard; the path
          itself cannot.  Wildcard  expressions  are  similar  to
          Unix egrep(1) (regular) expressions and may contain:

          *    matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

          ?    matches exactly 1 character

          [...]
               matches any  single  character  found  inside  the
               brackets;  ranges  are  specified  by  a beginning
               character, a hyphen, and an ending character.   If
               an  exclamation point or a caret (`!' or `^') fol-
               lows the left bracket, then the range  of  charac-
               ters within the brackets is complemented (that is,
               anything except the characters inside the brackets
               is considered a match).

          (Be sure to quote any character which  might  otherwise
          be  interpreted  or  modified  by the operating system,
          particularly under Unix and VMS.)  If  no  matches  are
          found,  the  specification  is  assumed to be a literal
          filename; and if that also fails, the  suffix  .zip  is
          appended.  Note that self-extracting ZIP files are sup-
          ported, as with any other ZIP archive; just specify the
          .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.

     [file(s)]
          An optional list of archive members  to  be  processed,

          separated  by  spaces.   (VMS  versions  compiled  with
          VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas  instead.
          See  -v  in  OPTIONS below.) Regular expressions (wild-
          cards) may be  used  to  match  multiple  members;  see
          above.   Again, be sure to quote expressions that would
          otherwise be expanded or modified by the operating sys-
          tem.

     [-x xfile(s)]
          An optional list of archive members to be excluded from
          processing.   Since wildcard characters match directory
          separators (`/'), this option may be  used  to  exclude
          any  files  which  are in subdirectories.  For example,
          ``unzip foo *.[ch] -x */*'' would extract all C  source
          files  in the main directory, but none in any subdirec-
          tories.  Without the -x option, all C source  files  in
          all directories within the zipfile would be extracted.

     [-d exdir]
          An optional directory to which to  extract  files.   By
          default,  all files and subdirectories are recreated in
          the current directory; the -d option allows  extraction
          in an arbitrary directory (always assuming one has per-
          mission to write to the directory).  This  option  need
          not  appear  at the end of the command line; it is also
          accepted immediately after the  zipfile  specification,
          or  between  the file(s) and the -x option.  The option
          and directory may be  concatenated  without  any  white
          space between them, but note that this may cause normal
          shell  behavior  to  be  suppressed.   In   particular,
          ``-d ~''  (tilde) is expanded by Unix C shells into the
          name of the  user's  home  directory,  but  ``-d~''  is
          treated  as a literal subdirectory ``~'' of the current
          directory.

OPTIONS
     Note that, in order to support obsolescent hardware, unzip's
     usage  screen is limited to 22 or 23 lines and should there-
     fore be considered a reminder  of  the  basic  unzip  syntax
     rather than an exhaustive list of all possible flags.

     -Z   zipinfo(1L) mode.  If the first option on  the  command
          line  is  -Z,  the  remaining  options  are taken to be
          zipinfo(1L) options.  See the appropriate  manual  page
          for a description of these options.

     -c   extract files to stdout/screen (``CRT'').  This  option
          is  similar  to  the  -p option except that the name of
          each file is printed as it is extracted, the -a  option
          is  allowed,  and  ASCII-EBCDIC conversion is automati-
          cally performed if appropriate.   This  option  is  not
          listed in the unzip usage screen.

UNZIP(1L)         MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES          UNZIP(1L)

     -f   freshen existing files, i.e., extract only those  files
          which  already  exist  on disk and which are newer than
          the disk  copies.   By  default  unzip  queries  before
          overwriting,  but the -o option may be used to suppress
          the queries.  Note that under many  operating  systems,
          the  TZ  (timezone)  environment  variable  must be set
          correctly in order for  -f  and  -u  to  work  properly
          (under Unix the variable is usually set automatically).
          The reasons for this are somewhat subtle but have to do
          with  the  differences  between  DOS-format  file times
          (always local time) and Unix-format  times  (always  in
          GMT)  and  the necessity to compare the two.  A typical
          TZ value is ``PST8PDT'' (US Pacific time with automatic
          adjustment   for  Daylight  Savings  Time  or  ``summer
          time'').

     -l   list  archive  files  (short   format).    The   names,
          uncompressed  file  sizes  and  modification  dates and
          times of the specified files are  printed,  along  with
          totals  for all files specified.  In addition, the zip-
          file comment and individual file comments (if any)  are
          displayed.   If  a file was archived from a single-case
          file system (for example, the old MS-DOS FAT file  sys-
          tem)  and the -L option was given, the filename is con-
          verted to lowercase and is prefixed with a caret (^).

     -p   extract files to pipe (stdout).  Nothing but  the  file
          data  is  sent  to  stdout,  and  the  files are always
          extracted in binary format, just as they are stored (no
          conversions).

     -t   test archive files.  This option extracts  each  speci-
          fied file in memory and compares the CRC (cyclic redun-
          dancy check, an enhanced checksum) of the expanded file
          with the original file's stored CRC value.

     -u   update existing files and create new  ones  if  needed.
          This  option  performs  the  same  function  as  the -f
          option, extracting (with query) files which  are  newer
          than  those with the same name on disk, and in addition
          it extracts those files which do not already  exist  on
          disk.   See  -f  above  for  information on setting the
          timezone properly.

     -v   be verbose or  print  diagnostic  version  info.   This
          option  has  evolved  and now behaves as both an option
          and a modifier.  As an  option  it  has  two  purposes:
          when  a  zipfile is specified with no other options, -v
          lists archive files verbosely, adding to  the  -l  info
          the  compression  method,  compressed size, compression
          ratio and 32-bit CRC.  When  no  zipfile  is  specified
          (that is, the complete command is simply ``unzip -v''),

          a diagnostic screen is printed.   In  addition  to  the
          normal  header  with  release  date  and version, unzip
          lists the home Info-ZIP ftp site and where  to  find  a
          list of other ftp and non-ftp sites; the target operat-
          ing system for which it was compiled, as well as  (pos-
          sibly)  the hardware on which it was compiled, the com-
          piler and version used, and the compilation  date;  any
          special  compilation  options  which  might  affect the
          program's operation (see also  DECRYPTION  below);  and
          any options stored in environment variables which might
          do the same (see  ENVIRONMENT  OPTIONS  below).   As  a
          modifier  it  works  in  conjunction with other options
          (e.g., -t) to produce more verbose or debugging output;
          this is not yet fully implemented but will be in future
          releases.

     -z   display only the archive comment.

MODIFIERS
     -a   convert text files.  Ordinarily all files are extracted
          exactly  as they are stored (as ``binary'' files).  The
          -a option causes files identified by zip as text  files
          (those  with  the `t' label in zipinfo listings, rather
          than `b') to be automatically extracted as  such,  con-
          verting  line  endings,  end-of-file characters and the
          character set itself as necessary.  (For example,  Unix
          files  use  line  feeds (LFs) for end-of-line (EOL) and
          have no end-of-file (EOF) marker; Macintoshes use  car-
          riage  returns  (CRs)  for  EOLs; and most PC operating
          systems use CR+LF for EOLs and control-Z for  EOF.   In
          addition, IBM mainframes and the Michigan Terminal Sys-
          tem use EBCDIC rather than the more common ASCII  char-
          acter  set,  and  NT supports Unicode.) Note that zip's
          identification of text files is by  no  means  perfect;
          some  ``text''  files  may  actually be binary and vice
          versa.    unzip   therefore   prints   ``[text]''    or
          ``[binary]''  as  a  visual  check  for  each  file  it
          extracts when using the  -a  option.   The  -aa  option
          forces all files to be extracted as text, regardless of
          the supposed file type.

     -C   match filenames case-insensitively.  unzip's philosophy
          is ``you get what you ask for'' (this is also responsi-
          ble for the -L/-U  change;  see  the  relevant  options
          below).   Because  some  filesystems  are  fully  case-
          sensitive (notably those under the Unix operating  sys-
          tem) and because both ZIP archives and unzip itself are
          portable across platforms, unzip's default behavior  is
          to  match  both  wildcard  and  literal filenames case-
          sensitively.  That is, specifying ``makefile''  on  the
          command  line  will  only  match  ``makefile''  in  the
          archive,  not   ``Makefile''   or   ``MAKEFILE''   (and

UNZIP(1L)         MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES          UNZIP(1L)

          similarly  for  wildcard  specifications).   Since this
          does not correspond  to  the  behavior  of  many  other
          operating/file  systems  (for  example, OS/2 HPFS which
          preserves mixed case but is not sensitive to  it),  the
          -C  option may be used to force all filename matches to
          be case-insensitive.  In the example above,  all  three
          files  would  then match ``makefile'' (or ``make*'', or
          similar).  The -C option affects files in both the nor-
          mal file list and the excluded-file list (xlist).

     -j   junk paths.  The archive's directory structure  is  not
          recreated;  all  files  are deposited in the extraction
          directory (by default, the current one).

     -L   convert to lowercase any  filename  originating  on  an
          uppercase-only  operating  system or filesystem.  (This
          was unzip's default behavior in releases prior to 5.11;
          the  new  default  behavior  is  identical  to  the old
          behavior with the -U option, which is now obsolete  and
          will be removed in a future release.)  Depending on the
          archiver, files archived under single-case  filesystems
          (VMS,  old  MS-DOS  FAT,  etc.)  may  be stored as all-
          uppercase names; this can be ugly or inconvenient  when
          extracting to a case-preserving filesystem such as OS/2
          HPFS or a case-sensitive one such as  under  Unix.   By
          default unzip lists and extracts such filenames exactly
          as they're stored (excepting truncation, conversion  of
          unsupported  characters,  etc.); this option causes the
          names of all files from certain systems to be converted
          to lowercase.

     -n   never overwrite existing  files.   If  a  file  already
          exists,  skip  the  extraction  of  that  file  without
          prompting.  By default unzip queries before  extracting
          any  file  which already exists; the user may choose to
          overwrite only the current file, overwrite  all  files,
          skip extraction of the current file, skip extraction of
          all existing files, or rename the current file.

     -o   overwrite existing files without prompting.  This is  a
          dangerous  option,  so  use it with care.  (It is often
          used with -f, however.)

     -q   perform operations quietly (-qq = even quieter).  Ordi-
          narily  unzip  prints  the  names  of  the  files  it's
          extracting or testing, the extraction methods, any file
          or zipfile comments which may be stored in the archive,
          and possibly a summary when finished with each archive.
          The  -q[q] options suppress the printing of some or all
          of these messages.

     -s   [OS/2, NT,  MS-DOS]  convert  spaces  in  filenames  to

UNZIP(1L)         MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES          UNZIP(1L)

          underscores.
           Since  all  PC  operating  systems  allow  spaces   in
          filenames,  unzip  by  default  extracts filenames with
          spaces intact (e.g.,  ``EA DATA. SF'').   This  can  be
          awkward,  however,  since MS-DOS in particular does not
          gracefully support spaces in filenames.  Conversion  of
          spaces  to underscores can eliminate the awkwardness in
          some cases.

     -U   (obsolete; to be removed in  a  future  release)  leave
          filenames  uppercase if created under MS-DOS, VMS, etc.
          See -L above.

     -V   retain (VMS) file version numbers.  VMS  files  can  be
          stored   with   a   version   number,   in  the  format
          file.ext;##.  By default the  ``;##''  version  numbers
          are  stripped,  but  this  option  allows  them  to  be
          retained.  (On filesystems  which  limit  filenames  to
          particularly  short lengths, the version numbers may be
          truncated or stripped regardless of this option.)

     -X   [VMS] restore owner/protection info (may require system
          privileges).    Ordinary  file  attributes  are  always
          restored, but this option allows UICs to be restored as
          well.   [The  next  version  of unzip will support Unix
          UID/GID info as well, and possibly NT permissions.]

     -$   [MS-DOS, OS/2, NT, Amiga] restore the volume  label  if
          the  extraction medium is removable (e.g., a diskette).
          Doubling the option  (-$$)  allows  fixed  media  (hard
          disks)  to  be  labelled  as  well.  By default, volume
          labels are ignored.

ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS
     unzip's default behavior may be modified via options  placed
     in  an  environment  variable.   This  can  be done with any
     option, but it is probably most useful with the -a, -L,  -C,
     -q, -o, or -n modifiers:  make unzip auto-convert text files
     by default, make it convert filenames from uppercase systems
     to  lowercase,  make it match names case-insensitively, make
     it quieter, or make it always overwrite or  never  overwrite
     files  as  it extracts them.  For example, to make unzip act
     as quietly as possible, only reporting errors, one would use
     one of the following commands:

         UNZIP=-qq; export UNZIP    Unix Bourne shell
         setenv UNZIP -qq           Unix C shell
         set UNZIP=-qq              OS/2 or MS-DOS
         define UNZIP_OPTS "-qq"    VMS (quotes for lowercase)

     Environment options are, in effect, considered  to  be  just
     like  any  other  command-line options, except that they are

UNZIP(1L)         MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES          UNZIP(1L)

     effectively the first options on the command line.  To over-
     ride  an  environment option, one may use the ``minus opera-
     tor'' to remove it.  For instance, to override  one  of  the
     quiet-flags in the example above, use the command

         unzip --q[other options] zipfile

     The first hyphen is the normal  switch  character,  and  the
     second  is  a  minus sign, acting on the q option.  Thus the
     effect here is to cancel one quantum of quietness.  To  can-
     cel both quiet flags, two (or more) minuses may be used:

         unzip -t--q zipfile
         unzip ---qt zipfile

     (the two are equivalent).  This may seem awkward or  confus-
     ing,  but it is reasonably intuitive:  just ignore the first
     hyphen and go from there.  It is also  consistent  with  the
     behavior of Unix nice(1).

     As suggested by the examples  above,  the  default  variable
     names  are  UNZIP_OPTS  for  VMS  (where  the symbol used to
     install unzip as a foreign command would otherwise  be  con-
     fused  with  the  environment  variable),  and UNZIP for all
     other operating systems.  For  compatibility  with  zip(1L),
     UNZIPOPT  is  also  accepted (don't ask).  If both UNZIP and
     UNZIPOPT  are  defined,  however,  UNZIP  takes  precedence.
     unzip's  diagnostic  option (-v with no zipfile name) can be
     used to check the values of  all  four  possible  unzip  and
     zipinfo environment variables.

     The timezone variable (TZ) should be set  according  to  the
     local  timezone  in  order  for  the  -f  and  -u to operate
     correctly.  See the description of  -f  above  for  details.
     This  variable may also be necessary in order for timestamps
     on extracted files to be set correctly.

DECRYPTION
     Encrypted archives are fully supported by Info-ZIP software,
     but due to United States export restrictions, the encryption
     and decryption sources are not  packaged  with  the  regular
     unzip  and  zip distributions.  Since the crypt sources were
     written by Europeans, however, they are freely available  at
     sites  throughout  the  world; see the file ``Where'' in any
     Info-ZIP source or binary distribution  for  locations  both
     inside and outside the US.

     Because of the separate distribution, not all compiled  ver-
     sions  of  unzip support decryption.  To check a version for
     crypt  support,  either  attempt  to  test  or  extract   an
     encrypted  archive,  or else check unzip's diagnostic screen
     (see the -v option above) for ``[decryption]'' as one of the

     special compilation options.

     There are no runtime options for decryption;  if  a  zipfile
     member  is  encrypted,  unzip  will  prompt for the password
     without echoing what is typed.  unzip continues to  use  the
     same  password  as  long  as it appears to be valid; it does
     this by testing a 12-byte header.  The correct password will
     always check out against the header, but there is a 1-in-256
     chance that an incorrect password will as well.  (This is  a
     security  feature  of  the  PKWARE  zipfile format; it helps
     prevent brute-force attacks which  might  otherwise  gain  a
     large  speed  advantage by testing only the header.)  In the
     case that an incorrect password is given but it  passes  the
     header  test  anyway,  either  an incorrect CRC will be gen-
     erated for the extracted data or else unzip will fail during
     the  extraction  because the ``decrypted'' bytes do not con-
     stitute a valid compressed data stream.

     If the first password fails the header check on  some  file,
     unzip  will prompt for another password, and so on until all
     files are extracted.  If a password is not known, entering a
     null  password (that is, just a carriage return) is taken as
     a signal to skip all further  prompting.   Only  unencrypted
     files  in  the  archive(s)  will  thereafter  be  extracted.
     (Actually that's not quite true; older versions  of  zip(1L)
     and  zipcloak(1L)  allowed  null  passwords, so unzip checks
     each encrypted file to see if the null password works.  This
     may  result in ``false positives'' and extraction errors, as
     noted above.)

     Note that there is presently no  way  to  avoid  interactive
     decryption.   This  is  another security feature:  plaintext
     passwords given on the command line or stored in files  con-
     stitute  a  risk because they may be seen by others.  Future
     releases may (under protest, with great disapproval) support
     such shenanigans.

EXAMPLES
     To  use  unzip  to  extract  all  members  of  the   archive
     letters.zip  into  the  current directory and subdirectories
     below it, creating any subdirectories as necessary:

         unzip letters

     To extract all  members  of  letters.zip  into  the  current
     directory only:

         unzip -j letters

     To test letters.zip, printing only a summary  message  indi-
     cating whether the archive is OK or not:

UNZIP(1L)         MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES          UNZIP(1L)

         unzip -tq letters

     To test all zipfiles in the current directory, printing only
     the summaries:

         unzip -tq \*.zip

     (The backslash before the asterisk is only required  if  the
     shell  expands  wildcards,  as  in Unix; double quotes could
     have  been  used  instead,  as  in   the   source   examples
     below.)  To  extract  to  standard  output  all  members  of
     letters.zip whose names end in .tex, auto-converting to  the
     local  end-of-line  convention  and  piping  the output into
     more(1):

         unzip -ca letters \*.tex | more

     To extract the binary file paper1.dvi to standard output and
     pipe it to a printing program:

         unzip -p articles paper1.dvi | dvips

     To extract all FORTRAN and C source  files--*.f,  *.c,  *.h,
     and Makefile--into the /tmp directory:

         unzip source.zip "*.[fch]" Makefile -d /tmp

     (the double quotes are necessary only in Unix  and  only  if
     globbing is turned on).  To extract all FORTRAN and C source
     files, regardless of case (e.g., both *.c and *.C,  and  any
     makefile, Makefile, MAKEFILE or similar):

         unzip -C source.zip "*.[fch]" makefile -d /tmp

     To extract any such files but convert any  uppercase  MS-DOS
     or  VMS  names  to lowercase and convert the line-endings of
     all of the files to the local standard (without  respect  to
     any files which might be marked ``binary''):

         unzip -aaCL source.zip "*.[fch]" makefile -d /tmp

     To extract only newer versions of the files already  in  the
     current  directory,  without  querying (NOTE:  be careful of
     unzipping in one timezone a zipfile created in  another--ZIP
     archives  to  date  contain  no  timezone information, and a
     ``newer'' file from an eastern timezone  may,  in  fact,  be
     older):

         unzip -fo sources

     To extract newer  versions  of  the  files  already  in  the
     current  directory and to create any files not already there

UNZIP(1L)         MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES          UNZIP(1L)

     (same caveat as previous example):

         unzip -uo sources

     To display a  diagnostic  screen  showing  which  unzip  and
     zipinfo options are stored in environment variables, whether
     decryption support was compiled in, the compiler with  which
     unzip was compiled, etc.:

         unzip -v

     In the last five examples, assume that UNZIP  or  UNZIP_OPTS
     is set to -q.  To do a singly quiet listing:

         unzip -l file.zip

     To do a doubly quiet listing:

         unzip -ql file.zip

     (Note that the ``.zip'' is generally not necessary.)  To  do
     a standard listing:

         unzip --ql file.zip
     or
         unzip -l-q file.zip
     or
         unzip -l--q file.zip       (extra minuses don't hurt)

TIPS
     The current maintainer, being a lazy  sort,  finds  it  very
     useful  to  define  a pair of aliases:  tt for ``unzip -tq''
     and ii for ``unzip -Z'' (or ``zipinfo'').  One may then sim-
     ply  type ``tt zipfile'' to test an archive, something which
     is worth making a habit of  doing.   With  luck  unzip  will
     report  ``No  errors  detected in zipfile.zip,'' after which
     one may breathe a sigh of relief.

     The maintainer  also  finds  it  useful  to  set  the  UNZIP
     environment variable to ``-aL'' and is tempted to add ``-C''
     as well.  His ZIPINFO variable is set to ``-z''.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit status (or error level) approximates the exit codes
     defined  by PKWARE and takes on the following values, except
     under VMS:

          0    normal; no errors or warnings detected.

          1    one or more warning errors were  encountered,  but
               processing  completed  successfully  anyway.  This
               includes zipfiles where  one  or  more  files  was

               skipped  due  to unsupported compression method or
               encryption with an unknown password.

          2    a  generic  error  in  the  zipfile   format   was
               detected.   Processing may have completed success-
               fully anyway;  some  broken  zipfiles  created  by
               other archivers have simple work-arounds.

          3    a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.
               Processing probably failed immediately.

          4-8  unzip was unable to allocate  memory  for  one  or
               more buffers.

          9    the specified zipfiles were not found.

          10   invalid options  were  specified  on  the  command
               line.

          11   no matching files were found.

          50   the disk is (or was) full during extraction.

          51   the end of the ZIP archive was encountered  prema-
               turely.

     VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other,
     scarier-looking things, so by default unzip always returns 0
     (which reportedly gets converted into a VMS  status  of  1--
     i.e., success).  There are two compilation options available
     to  modify  or  expand   upon   this   behavior:    defining
     RETURN_CODES results in a human-readable explanation of what
     the real error status was (but still  with  a  faked  ``suc-
     cess''  exit  value),  while defining RETURN_SEVERITY causes
     unzip to exit  with  a  ``real''  VMS  status.   The  latter
     behavior will probably become the default in future versions
     unless it happens to conflict with  officially  defined  VMS
     codes.  The current mapping is as follows:   1 (success) for
     normal exit, 0x7fff0001 for warning errors, and  (0x7fff0002
     +  16*normal_unzip_exit_status) for all other errors.  Check
     the ``unzip -v'' output to see whether  it  was  defined  at
     compilation time.

BUGS
     When attempting to extract a corrupted archive, unzip may go
     into  an  infinite  loop and, if not stopped quickly enough,
     fill all available disk  space.   Compiling  with  CHECK_EOF
     should fix this problem for all zipfiles, but the option was
     introduced too late in the testing process to  be  made  the
     default  behavior.  Future versions will be robust enough to
     fail gracefully on damaged archives.  Check the ``unzip -v''
     output   to   see   whether  CHECK_EOF  was  defined  during

     compilation.

     [MS-DOS] When extracting or testing files from an archive on
     a  defective  floppy  diskette,  if  the  ``Fail'' option is
     chosen from DOS's ``Abort, Retry, Fail?'' message, unzip may
     hang   the  system,  requiring  a  reboot.   Instead,  press
     control-C (or control-Break) to terminate unzip.

     Under DEC Ultrix, unzip will sometimes fail on long zipfiles
     (bad  CRC, not always reproducible).  This is apparently due
     either to a hardware bug (cache memory) or an operating sys-
     tem bug (improper handling of page faults?).

     Dates and times of stored directories are not restored.

     [OS/2] Extended  attributes  for  existing  directories  are
     never  updated.   This is a limitation of the operating sys-
     tem; unzip has no way to determine whether the stored attri-
     butes are newer or older than the existing ones.

     [VMS] When extracting to another directory, only the  [.foo]
     syntax  is  accepted  for the -d option; the simple Unix foo
     syntax is silently  ignored  (as  is  the  less  common  VMS
     foo.dir syntax).

     [VMS] When the file being extracted already exists,  unzip's
     query  only  allows skipping, overwriting or renaming; there
     should additionally be a choice for creating a  new  version
     of  the file.  In fact, the ``overwrite'' choice does create
     a new  version;  the  old  version  is  not  overwritten  or
     deleted.
