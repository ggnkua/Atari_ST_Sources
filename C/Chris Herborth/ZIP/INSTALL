  Yes, this is a rather long file, but don't be intimidated:  much of its
  length is due to coverage of multiple operating systems and of optional
  customization features, large portions of which may be skipped.  --GRR

To compile UnZip, UnZipSFX and/or fUnZip:
=========================================

(1) Unpack *.c and *.h (the actual source files), preserving the directory
    structure (e.g., ./unix/unix.c).  The sole exception is TOPS-20, where
    tops20/* should be unpacked into the current directory, but TOPS-20
    is no longer fully supported in this version.

    If you wish to compile with decryption enabled, you must get the zcrypt
    package (see "Where").  Unpack crypt.c and crypt.h from the zcrypt ar-
    chive, overwriting the dummy versions supplied with UnZip.  If you don't
    have any sort of unzipper available, you'll have to compile the non-
    crypt version first and use that to unpack the full crypt sources, then
    recompile.


(2) Choose the appropriate makefile based on the description in the Con-
    tents file for your OS (that is, there's only one for Unix or OS/2, but
    MS-DOS and several other OSes have several, depending on the compiler).
    Copy it into the current directory and rename if necessary or desired.
    (Some makefiles can be invoked in place; see (5) below.)

    Special point of confusion:  some MS-DOS targets are in non-MSDOS
    makefiles.  In particular, for DOS emx+gcc use the gccdos target of
    the OS/2 makefile (os2/makefile.os2), and for djgpp use the gcc_dos
    target of the Unix makefile (unix/Makefile).  In addition, OS/2 users
    of MSC can cross-compile to MS-DOS with makefile.os2's mscdos target.


(3) If you want a non-standard version of UnZip, define one or more of the
    following optional macros, either by adding them to the LOCAL_UNZIP
    environment variable or by editing your makefile as appropriate.  The
    syntax differs from compiler to compiler, but macros are often defined
    via "-DMACRO_NAME" or similar (for one called MACRO_NAME).  Note that
    some of these may not be fully supported in future releases (or even
    in the current release).

      CHECK_EOF   (recommended!)
        Corrupt zipfiles and zipfiles stored on damaged media (e.g., bad
        floppies) may cause UnZip to go into an infinite loop and either
        fill the disk(!) or, in some cases (notably under MS-DOS), hang the
        system.  (This only applies to testing or extraction of *damaged*
        archives, however.)  Defining CHECK_EOF enables special code which
        corrects the problem on most systems; DEC Ultrix may be one excep-
        tion.  The only reason this option is not defined by default is that
        it was introduced too late in the testing process.

      DOSWILD   (MS-DOS only)
        Treat trailing "*.*" like Unix "*" (i.e., matches anything); treat
        trailing "*." as match for files without a dot (i.e., matches any-
        thing, as long as no dots in name).  Special treatment only occurs
        if patterns are at end of arguments; i.e., "a*.*" matches all files
        starting with "a", but "*.*c" matches all files ending in "c" *only*
        if they have a dot somewhere before the "c".  Thus "*.*.*" could be
        used (albeit awkwardly) to specify all filenames with at least one
        dot in them, and "*." matches all filenames with no dots in them.
        [The default method of specifying these would be "*.*" and "* -x *.*",
        respectively, where the second example makes use of UnZip's exclude-
        files option.]  All other regular expressions (including "?" and
        "[range_of_chars]") retain their Unix-like behavior.

      VMSWILD   (VMS only)
        Treat brackets ([foobar]) as directories rather than ranges, and use
        '%' instead of '?' as the single-character wildcard.

      VMSCLI   (VMS only)
        Use VMS-style "slash options" (/FOOBAR) instead of the default Unix-
        style hyphenated options (-f).  This capability was added quite late
        in the beta cycle and isn't fully tested, so some features may not
        work as expected.  Also, it doesn't affect options stored in environ-
        ment variables (UNZIP_OPTS or ZIPINFO_OPTS); those use the Unix style
        regardless.

      CHECK_VERSIONS   (VMS only)
        UnZip "extra fields" are used to store VMS (RMS) filesystem info,
	and the format of this information may differ in various versions
	of VMS.  Defining this option will enable UnZip warnings when the
	stored extra-field VMS version(s) do(es) not match the version of
	VMS currently being used.  This is a common occurrence in zipfiles 
	received from other sites, but since the format of the filesystem
	does not seem to have changed in years (including on Alpha and Open-
	VMS systems), the warnings are not enabled by default.

      RETURN_SEVERITY   (VMS only)
        Return a VMS-style value in the range 0x7fff0001 to 0x7fff0332 for
        warnings or errors, or 1 for successful completion.  See unzip.doc
        for an explanation of the encoding of the normal UnZip return value.
        This option was added late in the beta cycle and hasn't been tested
        much yet, but it will likely become the default in future versions
        (assuming no collisions with official VMS error codes).

      RETURN_CODES   (VMS only)
        VMS interprets return codes according to a rigid set of guidelines,
        which means it misinterprets normal UnZip return codes as all sorts
        of really nasty errors.  Therefore by default VMS UnZip always returns
        zero regardless of whether any warnings or errors occurred (but see
        RETURN_SEVERITY above).  Define RETURN_CODES for a human-readable ex-
        planation of UnZip's return codes.  Note that this is often annoying.

      ASM_CRC   (Amiga/Aztec C only, for now)
        Use an assembler routine to calculate the CRC for each file (speed).

      ASM_INFLATECODES   (Amiga/Aztec C only, for now)
        Use an assembler version of inflate_codes() for speed.

      OLD_EXDIR   (Unix, OS/2, MS-DOS only)
        Use old behavior regarding the directory to which to extract:  the
        argument immediately after the zipfile name is the extraction dir;
        if the directory doesn't exist, create it if it was specified as
        "dir/" (i.e., with trailing path separator), else treat it as a
        stored file; if -d is used, treat the argument as a stored file re-
        gardless of trailing '/'.  For example:
            unzip foo bar       if bar is a dir, extract everything into it;
                                  otherwise extract bar as stored file
            unzip foo bar/      extract everything into bar, creating if nec.
            unzip -d foo bar/   treat bar/ as a stored directory and extract it

      NO_ZIPINFO
        Compile without zipinfo mode (-Z) enabled; makes a smaller executable
        because many text strings are left out.  Automatically enabled for
        some small-model compiles under MS-DOS and OS/2, so ordinarily there
        is no need to specify this explicitly.  (Note that even with this
        defined, the resulting executable may still be too big to extract
        some zipfiles correctly.)

      DEBUG
        Used for debugging purposes; enables Trace() statements.  Generally
        it's best to compile only one or two modules this way.


(4) If you regularly compile new versions of UnZip and always want the same
    non-standard option(s), add it (them) to the LOCAL_UNZIP environment
    variable.  Under MS-DOS, for example, add this to AUTOEXEC.BAT:

        set LOCAL_UNZIP -DDOSWILD -DOLD_EXDIR

    You can also use the variable to hold special compiler options (e.g.,
    -FPi87 for Microsoft C, if the x87 libraries are the only ones on your
    disk and they follow Microsoft's default naming conventions).


(5) Run the make utility on your chosen makefile:

      Unix
        For most systems it's possible to invoke the makefile in place, at
        the possible cost of an ignorable warning; do "make -f unix/Makefile
        list" to get a list of possible system targets, and then "make -f
        unix/Makefile target" for your chosen target.  The "generic" target
        works for most systems, but if it fails with a message about ftime()
        unresolved or timezone redefined, do "make clean", "make help", and
        then either "make generic2" or "make generic3" as instructed.  If all
        else fails, read the makefile itself; it contains numerous comments.

      VMS
        For a one-time build of the default UnZip, simply run the supplied
        command file MAKE.COM.  To use either DEC C on an Alpha or VAX C on
        a VAX, type "@make" (after copying make.com into the current direc-
        tory; otherwise do "@[.vms]make" to invoke it in place).  To use GNU
        C (gcc) on either platform, do "@make gcc".

        For repeated makes or other hacker-like tinkering with the sources,
        or to create a custom version of UnZip (especially with VMSCLI), use
        the included "MMS" makefile, DESCRIP.MMS.  Copy it into the current
        directory, read the comments at the top of it and run MadGoat's free
        MMS clone "MMK" on it.  DEC's MMS is no longer supported due to the
        use of MMK-specific extensions in DESCRIP.MMS.

      MS-DOS
        See the msdos\Contents file for notes regarding which makefile(s) to
        use with which compiler.  In summary:  pick one of msdos\makefile.*
        as appropriate, or (as noted above) use the OS/2 gccdos target for
        emx+gcc or the Unix gcc_dos target for djgpp.  There is also an mscdos
        cross-compilation target in os2\makefile.os2, an sco_dos cross-compil-
        ation target in unix\Makefile and a bcc_dos target in unix\Makefile
        as well.  The latter may disappear soon.  For Watcom 16-bit or 32-bit
        versions, see the comments in the OS/2 section below.

        After choosing the appropriate makefile and editing as necessary or
        desired, invoke the corresponding make utility.  Microsoft's NMAKE
        and the free dmake and GNU make utilities are generally the most
        versatile.  The makefiles in the msdos directory can be invoked in
        place (e.g., "nmake -f msdos\makefile.msc"), but the MS-DOS targets
        in the Unix makefile (gcc_dos and bcc_dos) cannot.

      OS/2
        Either GNU make, nmake or dmake may be used with the OS/2 makefile;
        all are freely available on the net.  Do "nmake -f os2\makefile.os2",
        for example, to get a list of supported targets.  For Watcom C/386 it
        is necessary to edit makefile.os2 and change the os2$(OBJ) target so
        it uses backslashes (i.e., "os2/os2.c" -> "os2\os2.c").  For Watcom
        16-bit OS/2 versions or any Watcom DOS version (cross-compilation),
        it is necessary to apply the patch in os2\watcom.dif.  (This patch
        arrived too late to be fully tested.)

        More generally, read the comments at the top of the makefile for an
        explanation of the differences between some of the same-compiler tar-
        gets.

      NT
        You will need the Windows NT SDK or Visual C++ for NT, both from
        Microsoft; or DEC C/C++ for DECpc AXP and NT.  Use the command line
        to compile.  For the DEC compiler edit out the "cdebug" line in
        nt\makefile as noted in the comments at the top of the makefile.
        From the main source directory do "nmake -F nt\makefile".

        If you are using VC++ you will get warnings about CL386 invoking CL,
        etc.  Don't worry, this is for compatibility with the SDK.  Microsoft
        should have changed the definition of $(cc) in ntwin32.mak for VC++.

        If you have VC++ 1.5 (16-bit) installed together with VC++ 1.0 (32-
        bit), make sure that you don't run the 16-bit compiler when you run
        nmake.

        At least with MSC 8.x (VC++ 1.x), it is possible to make a dual-mode
        self-extractor (DOS and NT/Chicago).  This is not built by default,
        but for those who don't care too much about the size, here's how:

            From: Steve Salisbury <stevesa@microsoft.com>
            Date: Fri, 22 Jul 94 17:18:06 PDT

            Did y'all know that you can build a dual mode (MS-DOS and Win32
            (NT + Chicago)) unzipsfx.exe by just making a 16-bit unzipsfx.exe
            and then specifying that as the 16-bit stub for the 32-bit unzip-
            sfx.exe?  You also have to specify the /Knoweas flag to the 16-bit
            linker.  I suspect that this won't work with C 6.0 and earlier,
            maybe not even with MS C/C++ 7.0.  Anyway, I use C 8.0 (a.k.a.
            Visual C 1.X), which has been shipping for 15+ months now.

            Make a little change to MSDOS\MAKEFILE.MSC to add the /KNOWEAS
            flag:

	            LDFLAGS = /KNOWEAS /nologo/noi/e/st:0x0c00

            rename the output file

	            ren UNZIPSFX.EXE UNZIPSFX.E16

            and then make a little change to NT\MAKEFILE to add the -STUB
            directive:

	            .obj.exe:
		            $(link) $(ldebug) $(conflags) $(conflibs) $** \
                             -out:$@ -STUB:$*.e16

            This is pretty useful.  It's nice to have dual-mode self-extracting
            files.

            I do notice that they are pretty huge files (41K for 16-bit 
            unzipsfx.exe, 69k for the 32-bit version, 110k for the dual).  Oh
            well.

      AmigaDOS
        SAS/Lattice C and Manx Aztec C are supported.  For SAS C 6.x do "lmk
        -f amiga/SMakeFile all"; for Aztec C do "make -f amiga/makefile.azt
        all".  The Aztec C version supports assembly-language versions of two
        routines; these are enabled by default.

      Atari TOS
        Turbo C is no longer supported; use gcc (tested with 2.4.5 and 2.5.8)
        and the MiNT libraries, and do "make".  Note that all versions of gcc
        prior to 2.5.8 have a bug affecting 68000-based machines (optimizer
        adds 68020 instructions).  See atari\README for comments on using
        other compilers.

      Macintosh
        Think C is the only currently supported compiler, although the Mac
        Programmer's Workbench (MPW) was supported at one time and still has
        hooks in unzip.h.  For Think C, un-BinHex the Think C project file
        and UnZip resource file (using BinHex 4.0 or later), then click on
        something or other... :-)  (I'm just making this up, since I haven't
        the faintest idea how Mac programming works.)

      Human68K
        [This is a Japanese machine and OS.]  It appears that GNU make and
        gcc are required; presumably just do "gmake -f human68k/Makefile.gcc"
        to build everything.

      TOPS-20
        [No longer fully supported due to new, unported features, although
        patches always accepted.]  Unpack all files into the current directory
        only (including those in the zipfile's tops20 directory), then use
        make.mic and "do make".

    Running the appropriate make utility should produce three executables on
    most systems, one for UnZip/ZipInfo, one for UnZipSFX, and one for fUnZip.
    (VMS is one prominent exception:  fUnZip makes no sense on it.)  Read any
    OS-specific README files for notes on setting things up for normal use
    (especially for VMS) and for warnings about known quirks and bugs in var-
    ious compilers (especially for MS-DOS).

    Also note that many OSes require a timezone variable to be set correctly
    (often "TZ"); Unix and VMS generally do so by default, but PC-based OSes
    generally do not.  See the discussion of the -f and -u options in the
    unzip man page (or unzip.doc).

    Then test your new UnZip on a few archives and let us know if there are
    problems (but *please* first make certain that the archives aren't actu-
    ally corrupted and that you didn't make one of the silly mistakes dis-
    cussed in the documentation).  If possible, test with PKUNZIP or with a
    previous version of UnZip, if you have one.



To install:
===========

Unix
  The default prefix for the installation location is /usr/local (things
  go into the bin and man/man1 subdirectories beneath the prefix), and
  the default man-page extension is "1" (corresponding to man/man1, above).
  To install as per the defaults, do "make install"; otherwise do "make
  prefix=/your/path manext=your_extension install".  For example, to install
  in your home directory with "l" as the man-page extension (for "local"),
  do "make prefix=$HOME manext=l install".  Permissions will be 755 for the
  executables and 644 for the man pages.  In general root must perform in-
  stallation into a public directory.  Do "rehash" if your shell requires
  it in order to find the new executables.

VMS
  Install UnZip as foreign symbol by adding this to login.com:

       $ unzip == "$disk:[dir]unzip.exe"
       $ zipinfo == "$disk:[dir]unzip.exe ""-Z"""

  where "disk" and "dir" are the location of the UnZip executable; the "$"
  before the disk name is important, as are the double-double-quotes around
  the -Z.  Some people, including the author, prefer a short alias such as
  "ii" instead of "zipinfo"; edit to taste.  See vms/README (or [.VMS]README.)
  for notes/warnings about zipfiles and UnZip under VMS.

OS/2, MS-DOS, NT, Atari, Amiga
  Move or copy unzip.exe (or unzip.ttp, or UnZip, or whatever) to a direc-
  tory in your path; also possibly copy the UnZip executable to zipinfo.exe
  (or ii.exe), or else create an alias or a batch or command file for zipinfo
  ("@unzip -Z %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9" under MS-DOS).  The latter is only
  relevant if NO_ZIPINFO was not defined, obviously...  For MS-DOS with djgpp,
  copy stub.exe to zipinfo.exe and modify as noted in the djgpp documentation.

Macintosh, Human68K, TOPS-20
  Dunno...
