NAME
     funzip - filter for extracting from a ZIP archive in a pipe

SYNOPSIS
     [...]  |  funzip [-password]  |  [...]

     funzip [-password] input.zip  |  [...]

ARGUMENTS
     [-password]
          Optional  password  to  be  used  if  ZIP  archive   is
          encrypted.   Decryption  may  not  be supported at some
          sites.  See DESCRIPTION for more details.

DESCRIPTION
     funzip acts as a filter; that is,  it  assumes  that  a  ZIP
     archive  is being piped into standard input, and it extracts
     the first member from the archive to stdout.  If there is an
     argument,  then  the  input  comes  from  the specified file
     instead of from stdin.  A password for encrypted  zip  files
     can  be  specified  on  the command line (preceding the file
     name, if any) by prefixing the password with a  dash.   Note
     that  this  constitutes  a  security  risk  on many systems;
     currently running processes are  often  visible  via  simple
     commands  (e.g.,  ps(1)  under  Unix), and command-line his-
     tories can be read.  If the first entry of the zip  file  is
     encrypted  and no password is specified on the command line,
     then the user is prompted for a password and the password is
     not echoed on the console.

     Given the limitation on single-member extraction, funzip  is
     most useful in conjunction with a secondary archiver program
     such as tar(1).  The following section includes  an  example
     illustrating this usage in the case of disk backups to tape.

EXAMPLES
     To use funzip to  extract  the  first  member  file  of  the
     archive test.zip and to pipe it into more(1):

         funzip test.zip | more

     To use funzip to test the first member file of test.zip (any
     errors will be reported on standard error):

         funzip test.zip > /dev/null

     To use zip and funzip in place of  compress(1)  and  zcat(1)
     (or gzip(1L) and gzcat(1L)) for tape backups:

         tar cf - . | zip -7 | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=8k
         dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=8k | funzip | tar xf -

     (where, for example, nrst0 is a SCSI tape drive).

BUGS
     When piping an encrypted file into more and allowing  funzip
     to  prompt for password, the terminal may sometimes be reset
     to a non-echo mode.  This is apparently due to a race condi-
     tion  between  the two programs; funzip changes the terminal
     mode to non-echo before more reads its state, and more  then
     ``restores''  the  terminal to this mode before exiting.  To
     recover, run  funzip  on  the  same  file  but  redirect  to
     /dev/null  rather  than  piping  into  more; after prompting
     again for the password, funzip will reset the terminal prop-
     erly.

     There is presently no way to  extract  any  member  but  the
     first  from a ZIP archive.  This would be useful in the case
     where a ZIP archive is included within another archive.   In
     the  case where the first member is a directory, funzip sim-
     ply creates the directory and exits.

     The functionality of  funzip  should  be  incorporated  into
     unzip itself (future release).
