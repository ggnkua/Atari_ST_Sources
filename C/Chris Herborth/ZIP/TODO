================================
For UnZip 5.1/5.2/6.0/who knows:
================================

The Big Plan [original 26 Jan 93]:

   o extract-to-dir capability

	DONE.

   o add wildcard zipfiles

	DONE.

   o incorporate zipinfo

	DONE.

   o clean up unzip.h

	DONE.

   o rewrite to use fwrite/no outbuf

	DONE.

   o replace EOL conversion code and make text/binary conversion automatic

	DONE.

   o add self-extracting unzip:  deflated/stored only, suppress "extra bytes"
     message, use argv[0] with path search, remove do_wild, etc.

	DONE.

   o move all strings to far memory under small-memory OS's, copying
     back to local memory (slide[] buffer?) only when ready to print

	DONE, except for possible use of slide[]; os2.c; crypt.c;
	inflate.c (incomplete trees messages); other decompression
	routines?; etc.

   o add -C option for case-insensitivity of filename matching

	DONE.

for 5.2:
   o enable CHECK_EOF and RETURN_SEVERITY by default

	immediately! (start testing...)

   o incorporate Scott Maxwell OS/2 DLL mods

	next

   o add Unix extra field (GMT modification and status-change times)

	next

   o rewrite to use fread/fseek/no ReadByte/etc.  [eventually: test
     write(bytes) vs. fwrite(words), especially on Crays/Alphas]

	soon; ReadByte gone already.

   o incorporate new backfill version of inflate()

	next after fread/fseek/ReadByte

   o add multi-part zipfile handling

	next after that

   o check NEXTBYTE for EOF in crypt.c, funzip.c and explode.c, too

	soon

   o use (simple!) configure script in combination with Unix Makefile

	someday

   o add option to force completely non-interactive operation (no queries
     for overwrite/rename, password, etc.); also allow some sort of non-
     interactive password provision?  (file? command-line? env. variable?)

	someday?

   o add ONLY_ZIPINFO compilation for 16-bit compiles

	later, possibly never

   o add testing of extra fields (if have CRC)

	later

   o change all output so goes through configurable routines (msg(),
     warn(), err()) for simpler GUI interfacing

	later

   o rewrite to allow use as a filter

	way, way later...

   o add option to search zipfile contents for a string and print the
     results? ("zipgrep" option--e.g., unzip -g or unzip -S) (easy for
     fixed strings, hard for wildcards/true regex's)

	way, way later, if at all...

   o add -y "display symlinks" option to zipinfo?  various sorting options?
     (-St date/time, -Sn name)?

	who knows

   o add "in-depth" option to zipinfo? (check local headers against
     central, etc.)--make it a better debugging tool (or just create
     zipfix)

	who knows

   o ports underway:  Acorn/RISCos, AOS/VS, ...


- allow multiple dir creation with -d option?  (Bob Maynard)
