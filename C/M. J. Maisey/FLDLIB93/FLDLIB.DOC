                               FLDLIB
               Floating dialogue library for Lattice C
                         v0.93 beta (18/5/94)

                             Introduction
                             ------------

FLDLIB was designed to be a very easy to use windowed dialog library
which would  integrate  into existing programs  with the minimum  of
hassle, and which would make writing  simple applications which only
use dialogs very quick.

It will  manage as  many floating (windowed) dialogs  as the  AES or
memory allows,  and take care of all event  handling for these wind-
ows.

The library has been  written for use  with Lattice C 5. Any port to
another implementation of C  will involve the writing of replacement
wind_redraw and  wind_title functions. Anyone  wishing to distribute
such a port should contact me first.


                                General
                                -------

Unless you are using the fld_do() call, you will be dealing with the
floating dialogs via a unique  handle which each will have. You will
also have  to change the  structure of your  program a little to re-
flect the non-modality of the dialog system.

All structures, function prototypes and defines are in fldlib.h.

fldlib.o (the actual library)  must be linked in to any programs us-
ing it. In Lattice C 5.5 and above this is  done by adding it to the
'input files' list in the project manager.

I apologise  for the use  of the American 'dialog'  throughout these
docs  and this library, but  all GEM documentation I have  seen uses
this spelling!


                             FLDLIB calls
                             ------------

short fld_do(form, title)
OBJECT *form;
char *title;

Manages a single form in a window.  No other floating dialogs may be
open.

Returns:    Index of clicked object
         OR FLDC_NONE if other dialogs already open or the close box
            on the dialog was clicked.

'tree' is a pointer to the resource tree to be managed.
'title' is the title of the window to be opened.

Notes:

This function is ideal for  use by those who wish to manage a single
floating  dialog at a time, in a  modal manner, as  your application
cannot respond to other GEM events while the dialog is open.

No setup is  required for the call (e.g. form_dial,  form_center) as
all  setup is done  for you, with  the dialog  being centred  on the
screen.

The dialog  is automatically  closed before  the call returns  (e.g.
when an object with  EXIT or TOUCHEXIT  flags set has been selected,
or the close box has been clicked).

To initialise close boxes, an fld_ability(FLDA_CLOSE) should be iss-
ued before the fld_do().

----------------------------------------------

short fld_open(form, centred, title, type)
OBJECT *form;
short centred, type;
char *title;

Opens a floating dialog.

Returns:    Handle of floating dialog
         OR -1 if problem

'form' is a pointer to the object tree to be managed.
'centred' indicates the of centreing to be done before opening
          FLDC_NONE     Do not centre
          FLDC_SCREEN   Centre on screen
          FLDC_MOUSE    Centre on mouse pointer
'title' is the title of the window to be opened
'type' can be  any short  int. It is  not used internally by FLDLIB,
       and  is purely for the programmer's benefit.  It will be ret-
       urned by  the floating  dialog management  routines which may
       deal  with more  than one dialog.  If assigned a unique value
       (typically the index of the  resource tree), it can provide a
       clearer  method than  the handle for  differentiating between
       different floating  dialogs (see the examples  for a demonst-
       ration of its use).

Notes:

This call opens a floating dialog  for use with fld_domulti() or the
fld_key()/fld_mouse()/fld_event combination.  form_dial() et al  are
not required beforehand.

If fld_open is called with a form parameter which points to the same
OBJECT as an already open flying dialog, the existing dialog will be
topped and its handle returned.

----------------------------------------------

void fld_close(fldhandle)
short fldhandle;

Close a floating dialog.

'fldhandle' is the handle of the floating dialog to be closed.

Notes:

This call closes a floating dialog. It is used with fld_domulti() or
the fld_key/fld_mouse()/fld  event combination. Note that dialogs do
not have to be  explicitly closed before program  exit if fld_exit()
is used.

----------------------------------------------

void fld_exit(void)

Clean up before program exit.

Notes:

This call should be used directly before  appl_exit(). It closes all
open floating dialogs and frees the memory malloc'd by the library.

----------------------------------------------

short fld_domulti(type, fldhandle)
short *type, *fldhandle;

Manage multiple floating dialogs.

Returns:    Index of selected object
         OR The negative fldhandle of a closed fldhandle

'type' is filled  in with the type  of the floating  dialog with the
       selected object
'fldhandle' is filled in with the handle of the floating dialog.

Notes:

This call manages multiple floating dialogs, which must be previous-
ly opened with fld_open().  It is suitable for use in programs which
only use  floating  dialog windows  and do  not do their  own window
management routines.

Floating dialogs are *not* closed when an exit object is clicked on, 
although when fld_ability(FLDA_CLOSE) has been called to enable clo-
ser gadgets, they may  be closed  by the  library  when a closer has
been clicked on.  In this case, a negative  return code will be rec-
ieved by  the application.  This code  will be  the negative of  the
fldhandle of the closed dialogue.

----------------------------------------------

short fld_key(kc, type, fldhandle)
short kc, *type, *fldhandle;

Respond to keypress from evnt_multi().

Returns:    Index of selected object
         OR -1 if none selected.

'kc' is the keypress returned by evnt_multi()
'type' is filled  in with the type of  the floating dialog  with the
       selected object
'fldhandle' is filled in with the handle of the floating dialog.

Notes:

This call  is for use in programs  which wish to  utilise non-dialog
windows as well  as using floating dialogs. It should be used  every
time  a MU_KEYBD event  is received, and will check  if any floating
dialogs are  topped and process  the keypress. It will return -1 and
fill in 'type' and 'fldhandle' if an object has been selected. Curr-
ently, the only way this will arise is if  a default exit button ex-
ists on the dialog and <return> has been pressed.

----------------------------------------------

short fld_mouse(x, y, numclicks, type, fldhandle)
short x, y, numclicks, *type, *fldhandle;

Respond to button click event from evnt_multi().

Returns:    Index of selected object
         OR -1 if none selected.

'x', 'y' and 'numclicks' are returned by evnt_multi()
'type' is filled  in with the type of  the floating dialog  with the
       selected object
'fldhandle' is filled in with the handle of the floating dialog.

Notes:

This call  is for use in programs  which wish to  utilise non-dialog
windows as well  as using floating dialogs. It should be used  every
time a  MU_BUTTON event is received, and will check  if any floating
dialogs are topped and process the click. It will return -1 and fill
in 'type' and 'fldhandle' if an object has been selected.

----------------------------------------------

short fld_mesag(msgbuf)
short *msgbuf;

Respond to message from evnt_multi().

Returns:    FLDR_NONE
         or fldhandle of closed dialog

'msgbuf' is the message buffer filled in by evnt_multi().

Notes:

This call  is for use in programs  which wish to  utilise non-dialog
windows as well  as using floating dialogs. It should be used  every
time a MU_MESAG event is received.

Applications which have called fld_ability(FLDA_CLOSE) should monit-
or the return value  to check whether dialog closer boxes  have been
clicked, as applications are responsible for taking their own action
with  closed dialogue  boxes (typically this will  just  be to  call
fld_close()). It is recommended that closer clicks should be treated
as a 'Cancel' rather than an 'OK'.

----------------------------------------------

void fld_draw(fldhandle, startobj, depth)
short fldhandle;
int startobj, int depth;

Redraw floating dialog.

'fldhandle' is the handle of the dialog
'startobj' is the object to start drawing from
'depth' is the depth to draw to

Notes:

This call should be used as a  replacement for an objc_draw after an
object's attributes have been changed by the program. Object redraw-
ing is handled by the library at all other times.

objc_draw() should *never* be used to redraw floating dialogs.

----------------------------------------------

int fld_getwin(fldhandle)
short fldhandle;

Find window handle for a given floating dialog.

Returns:    AES window handle
         OR NULL if invalid handle

'fldhandle' is the handle for the dialog.

Notes:

This call provides an easier way  to find the windowhandle of a dia-
log  than poking  around  in the  FLD structures  used internally by
FLDLIB.

----------------------------------------------

OBJECT *fld_getform(fldhandle)
short fldhandle;

Find object tree for a given floating dialog.

Returns:    Pointer to object tree
         OR NULL if invalid handle

'fldhandle' is the handle for the dialog.

Notes:

This call  provides an easier way to find the tree  used by a float-
ing dialog than poking around  in the FLD structures used internally
by FLDLIB.

----------------------------------------------

FLD *fld_getfld(fldhandle)
short fldhandle;

Find FLD structure for given handle

Returns:    Pointer to FLD structure
         OR NULL if invalid handle

'fldhandle' is the handle for the dialog.

Notes:

This call might be used to  implement functions not included as part
of the  library - for example, changing the object  tree for a given
dialog, and is also used for patching  in an addition redraw routine
(see below).

Changes to the contents of  the FLD structure (particularly the next
and fldhandle members) should be made with EXTREME CAUTION, as it is
possible  to crash the library by  doing this. The FLD  structure is
defined in FLDLIB.H.

----------------------------------------------

FLD *fld_findtype(type)
short type;

Find FLD structure for given floating dialog type.

Returns:    Pointer to FLD structure
         OR NULL if type not found

'type' is the type of the dialog.

Notes:

This call will help you is you wish to check whether a dialog is op-
en or not without tracking via fldhandles thoughout your program.

If there are two  or more open dialogs  with the same type, the  FLD 
structure for the first opened will be returned.

----------------------------------------------

FLD *fld_findform(form)
short form;

Find FLD structure for given object tree.

Returns:    Pointer to FLD structure
         OR NULL if object tree not found

'form' is the pointer to the object tree.

Notes:

This call will help you is you wish to check whether a dialog is op-
en or not without tracking via fldhandles thoughout your program.

----------------------------------------------

void fld_ability(progability)
int progability;

Set ability of application to handle more advanced FLDLIB features.

'progability' a bitmask of the ability of the application. Currently
              the only defined values are
              
              FLDA_CLOSE indicating that closer boxes should be ena-
                         bled.
              
              FLDA_ICON  indicating that iconify boxes should be en-
                         abled.
              
          and FLDA_NONE  indicating no extra  abilities.  This value
                         is a placeholder value. It is not currently
                         necessary  to  explicitly call  fld_ability
                         as it is the default.
                        
Notes:

FLDA_CLOSE   alters  the  behaviour  of  the  functions  fld_open(),
fld_do, fld_domulti() and  fld_event(). The documentation for  these
functions should be consulted, as  close box handling may need to be
added to your source.

FLDA_ICON does not require  any additional handling  in your source.
Iconification is completely handled by the library

This function is likely to be used in the future to enable other ad-
ditions to FLDLIB.

               Adding a customised dialog redraw routine
               -----------------------------------------
                            (Advanced users)

A technique that has been fairly widely used with modal dialog boxes
is to just draw graphics  other than those  available as GEM objects
straight over the  dialog. This will not work with windowed dialogs,
which may be pushed to the back and later require redrawing.

It should  be noted that to be totally solid, programs should imple-
ment  this  type of  graphic  via  G_USERDEF objects.  However,  the
G_USERDEF system  can be quite  difficult  to use, and hence  FLDLIB
provides an alternative method.

Each object  has an FLD structure associated,  which may be obtained
with fld_getfld(). The 'xredraw' member is a pointer to an addition-
al redraw routine for the windowed  dialog. Normally this is NULL (=
no additional  redraw),  but can  be set to a  function to be called
every time a redraw is required. This  is done in the following man-
ner.

  fld_getfld(fldhandle)->xredraw = custom_redraw;

Where custom_redraw is a function of type:

  int custom_redraw(int windowhandle, GRECT *rect)  {
    /* redraw code goes here */

    return 1;
  }

'windowhandle' will be irrelevent to custom redraw routines
'rect' is the clipping rectangle for the redraw

The redraw routine should always return 1, unless it wishes to abort
the redraw.  It will  be called once for every  rectangle that needs
redrawing.

Three external variables are set during redraws, and are:

  OBJECT *fld_tempform;   /* Pointer to the object tree being
                             drawn over */
  int fld_tempstart;      /* Start object for the redraw */
  int fld_tempdepth;      /* Depth of the redraw */

These are defined in fldlib.h.
