 2006.02.07

 Based on version 1.2 by Charles MacDonald

 Video init/exit code "borrowed" from DHS demosystem
 C2P stuff by Mikael Kalms


 [What the heck]

 SMS Plus is Sega Master System and Game Gear emulator. It was originally
 written for DOS, but the original author, Charles MacDonald, made it
 extremely easy to port to other platforms. What a nice guy, btw.

 This is a very basic port. No fancy stuff anywhere. It only works with
 VIDEL-compatible graphics; users with clones or graphicscards should
 try SMS-SDL instead (just convert the source files to unix format
 and compile!).

 Don't bug Charles MacDonald unless absolutely necessary. If you have
 any questions or comments regarding this port, please contact me.

 Important: I do not take responsibility for anything that might happen
 when you use this software. If it sets your pubes on fire or something,
 call the firebrigade - not me.


 [Features]

 - Emulation of Game Gear and Master System
 - Sound emulation (PSG only)
 - Joypad & Joystick support
 - 2-player support
 - Frameskip option

 [Requirements]

 - A F030 with a fast CPU (68060 preferred)

 [Compiling]

 You'll need a proper GCC setup.

 MacDonald's website and depack them in a suitable
 directory.

 Copy the 'atari' folder into this directory.
 
 cd to 'atari/', type make.

 [Known issues]
  - Needs a fast machine.
    On slow machines, try GameGear games in 16bpp.
  - 3D games flickers like hell. Try an even frameskip value.
    (or get a non-3D version of the game - they suck anyway)
  - Rasters currently requires 16-bit screen depth
  - Samples sound like total crap
  - Sound is transposed slightly
  - FM-sound is not emulated
  - Sprite collission won't work in some games (starwars)
  - Periodic noise sounds wrong (James Pond II and others)
  - Some games look really ugly, don't know why (Sonic Blast)
