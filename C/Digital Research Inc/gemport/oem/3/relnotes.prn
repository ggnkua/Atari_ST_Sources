                    GEM DOS (tm) 1.0 RELEASE NOTES



This document explains the latest changes to GEM DOS (tm) 1.0 on the
Lisa(tm).  It assumes you are familiar with the information
contained in the GEM DOS (tm) OEM package.

License Issues:
    A single copy license for the MINCE (tm) text editor has
    been purchased for you. Please fill out the owner registration
    card immediately and return it to Mark of the Unicorn.

General Suggestions:

    Use the Install.bat files to build the hard disk. The
    bootable disk #1 MUST BE INSTALLED FIRST. The other
    disks can be installed in any order.

    NOTE: Each diskette will display a "File not Found" 
          message for a file "INST????.BAT". This is an
          artifact of the way the diskettes were duplicated;
          it does not imply an error or oversight.



    To execute the GEM DESKTOP; enter C:\GEMVDI.PRG


Duplication:

    It is not expected that an OEM will actually duplicate
software in the Lisa disk format, We have provided a set of .bat
files that use the command line interpreter to format and
duplicate diskettes. If a suitable format program and disk bios
exists for your target machine, this type of approach should be
acceptable for limited duplication. The files with names in the
form BILD????.bat use the hard disk as a source and the floppy as
a destination. INST????.bat files use a floppy as a source and
the hard disk as a destination. *.prn files are used by both
types of .bat files for a list of filenames to be copied. The
DSKFMT.BAT file formats a floppy and is used frequently. Hard
disk initialization, user messages and abort proceedures, and
directory manipulation are illustrated. No provision is made for
serialization or data comparison between source and destination.

Documentation:
*  The GEM DOS (tm) User's Guide contains descriptions of the       
DISKCOPY and CHKDSK transient commands. These two commands are
not implemented in vsersion 1.0.

*   The C Language Programming Guide has a GEM DOS (tm) supplement        
containing relevant update materials.

*   The supplement to the Kermit manual contains implementation
specific material.


*   The Bios interface information is contained in the following

                            BIOS INTERFACE


System Initialization Sequence :

    1)    Disable interrupts if necessary.

    2)    Perform necessary chip and peripheral initialization to
          put the HW environment in a quiescent state.

    3)    Initialize TRAP #13 vector to the BIOS's handler address.

    4)    Initialize sector buffers similar to the following code:
              char secbuf[4][512];
              BCB bcbx[4];
              BCB *bufl[2];

              bcbx[0].b_link = &bcbx[1];
              bcbx[2].b_link = &bcbx[3];
              bcbx[0].b_bufdrv = -1;
              bcbx[1].b_bufdrv = -1;
              bcbx[2].b_bufdrv = -1;
              bcbx[3].b_bufdrv = -1;
              bcbx[0].b_bufr = &secbuf[0][0];
              bcbx[1].b_bufr = &secbuf[1][0];
              bcbx[2].b_bufr = &secbuf[2][0];
              bcbx[3].b_bufr = &secbuf[3][0];
              bufl[0] = &bcbx[0];           /* fat buffers */
              bufl[1] = &bcbx[2];           /* dir/data buffers */ 

    (The array of BCB pointers, bufl[], which has the linkable
    name _bufl, must be a global label. It will be linked with
    the GEM DOS (tm) object modules.)

    5)    Invoke osinit() (or '_osinit' from assembler).

    6)    Perform BDOS D_SetDrv(default_drive) via TRAP #1.

    7)    If CLI is to be executed normally (that is, loaded from disk
          and executed):


              Perform BDOS
              P_Exec(0,"command.prg","","path=default_path\0")
              via TRAP #1.

    Else, to execute a linked in CLI:


              Include the modules COMA.O and COMMAND.O when
              linking the system.


              Perform BDOS P_Exec(5,"","","") via TRAP #1, which
              returns the address of a partially initialized base
              page.




                                  -4-	




                    GEM DOS (tm) 1.0 RELEASE NOTES

                            BIOS INTERFACE


              Move the address of cli() (that is, _cli) to base page +
              p_tbase (8).

              Perform BDOS P_Exec(4,"","","path=default_path\0").

Linking the CLI with the system image allows new types of media to be 'INIT'ed
from the command line, provided that formatting has already been done.

N.B.
When the system is linked, the label _GSX_ENT will be undefined.  This
    does not affect the operation of the system.


    If the system is to be generated for 68010 (or similar) hardware, the
    module RWA10.O should be used instead of RWA.O.

05  Get/Set exception vector

    LONG      Get_Set_Vector(n, addr)
    WORD      n;                  /* vector number for operation    */
    LONG      addr;               /* address/parameter value        */

                        vector[n] = addr;

              return (temp);
    }

    Extended vectors

    0x101     Critical error handler

              It is the responsibility of the BIOS to invoke the routine at
              this vector whenever a disk related critical error occurs,
              such as write fault, drive not read, etc.

              It is the responsibility of the handler that installs itself
              to save d3-d7/a3-a7 if they are used.  The error number of the
              critical error is a WORD parameter on the stack.

                        To ignore the error, set D0.L to 0 and return.

                        To retry, set D0.L to 0x10000 and return.

                        To abort, move error parameter to D0 and sign extend
                        it to a LONG.

              If the target system is intended to support character based
              (that is, non-GEM related applications), it is the
              responsibility of the BIOS implementor to make the console
              I/O portion of the BIOS re-entrant from this handler
              so that user prompting can be done.

    0x102     Terminate handler

              It is the responsibility of the handler to determine whether
              it should allow the process termination to continue.
              To terminate, simply RTS. Otherwise, 'longjump' back
              into the main code of the process.

    NOTE:  If the BIOS supports logical drives A and B on a single
    physical drive, it should return both bits set if a floppy disk
    is present.
