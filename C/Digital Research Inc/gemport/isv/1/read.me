Two files on this disk are renamed replacements for
files included in the Alpha.  These are:

     AESBIND.A replaces CRYSIF.O.  AES interface as a searchable library.

     OPTIMIZE.O replaces CROPTIM.O AES optimize functions

The remaining files on this disk are just newer versions of the existing
files.

In addition, the file UMULDIV.S should be deleted from this disk.  It
is not only not needed, it contains junk.
