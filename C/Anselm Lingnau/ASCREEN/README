
README file for ASCREEN 3.2
===========================

What is ASCREEN?
----------------
ASCREEN 3.2 is a GEM-based DVI screen previewer for the Atari series
of computers. Its features include

*** SPEED: One of the fastest previewers available for the Atari.

*** CONVENIENCE: Depending on how much memory is available, formatted
pages are cached for later retrieval (You can cache about 8
normal-sized pages on a 1MB ST. With a 4MB ST or a TT, the sky's the
limit). Memory usage can be deliberately limited so other programs
won't be cramped.  While you are looking at one page, a unique
`cache-ahead' feature formats the next one. You can open as many
windows as GEM will let you have, and look at several pages or various
parts of the same page all at once. You can also shrink pages or even
double pages to check their overall layout. ASCREEN 3.2 can be
controlled by mouse or by keyboard, and many keyboard commands can be
changed to suit your preferences.

*** COMPATIBILITY: ASCREEN 3.2 is completely GEM-based and should be
able to take advantage of any graphics hardware that supports GEM. It
has been tested on various configurations ranging from an Atari 520ST
with a SM124 monitor to an Atari TT driving a TTM195 hi-res monochrome
display. No known dependencies on the TOS version exist (checked against
1.0, 1.02, 1.04, 2.06, 3.06).

ASCREEN 3.2 fits neatly into most implementations of TeX on the ST.
You can even go on using your native previewer's fonts since ASCREEN
lets you configure its resolution and font naming scheme. ASCREEN
supports graphics \special commands of Christoph Strunk's csTeX and
Stefan Lindner's CTeX for the ST as well as the Unix tpic \special
commands. ASCREEN can also handle packed font libraries in the FLIB
format of Eberhard Mattes's emTeX, to help saving disk space.

ASCREEN 3.2 can be called from the GEM desktop, from any command line
shell that can start GEM applications, or from leading TeX shells like
Christoph Strunk's `cTeX' or the `TeXshell' by Kiessling, Heidrich and
Maluschka.

ASCREEN 3.2 works together with multitasking GEM extensions like PAM's
MultiGEM or the new Atari MultiTOS. With MultiTOS or Winx 2.0, the
control elements of non-active windows are handled correctly. You can
even set up your TeX system so that ASCREEN will automatically
re-display the current DVI file after a TeX run.

*** CUSTOMIZABILITY: Defaults for most settings can be specified in a
configuration file. Any one of several configuration files can be
selected from the command line or loaded from the menu bar while the
program is running. The defaults may be overridden from the command
line, and there are dialog boxes available as well. At any instant, a
snapshot of the current settings may be saved to another configuration
file. Items that can be customized include:

	- path names for DVI files, fonts and graphics files
	- font resolution and naming
	- minimum page dimensions
	- memory management parameters: number of pages cached,
		size of font management arena
	- DVI buffering parameters
	- various switches controlling program behaviour

*** INTERNATIONALIZATION: ASCREEN 3.2 comes with German and English user
interfaces. Adding yet another language is as simple as editing one of
the enclosed resource files. You can even use ASCREEN in various
languages on the same computer: just assign the name of the appropriate
resource file to a special environment variable.

How much does it cost?
----------------------
Nothing, except for the price of a blank disk and whatever
transmission costs are involved in getting the program to you. You can
get and use ASCREEN 3.2 for free. You may also redistribute it if you
don't make any money off it or pretend that you wrote it.

ASCREEN 3.2 may be made available in BBS if retrieving it doesn't cost
more than the cost of transmission. It may not be incorporated into
`public domain software libraries' without my written consent.

If you like ASCREEN, I would appreciate a picture postcard of where
you live. Of course I accept other donations as well; my bank account
particulars are given at the end of the (German) manual.

How can I get ASCREEN?
----------------------
ASCREEN 3.2 is available for anonymous FTP from
ftp.math.uni-frankfurt.de [141.2.90.2], directory pub/atari.  There
are also other goodies available, such as pre-cooked FLIB files for
LaTeX or AMSFonts.

*Please note that this site is in Germany, Europe, and retrieve the
software only at off-peak times, that is, 1800-0800 hours CET (UT+0100),
or during the weekend.*

I will also snail-mail copies of ASCREEN if you send me a blank disk
and a self-addressed envelope. Be sure to include the appropriate
return postage. Ask for International Reply Coupons at your local post
office. You might need a bunch of those. If you already have an
ASCREEN you should tell me its version number; if I don't have a newer
one I will keep your disk safe and send it back when a new version is
released. 

There is an electronic mailing list for announcements, bug reports,
comments, questions and general discussion about ASCREEN; send mail to
`ascreen-request@math.uni-frankfurt.de' to subscribe or to find out
more.
