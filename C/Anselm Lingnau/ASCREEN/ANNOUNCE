
ANNOUNCEMENT --- ASCREEN 3.2
============================

I'm pleased to announce that the newest version of ASCREEN, the DVI
previewer for Atari computers, is now available for anonymous FTP.
Enhancements in this version include

- Fixes for various bugs in font handling, screen management and GEM
  support. In particular, the bothersome bug concerning slashes in IMG
  file names and the other bothersome bug concerning auto-repeat scroll
  arrows have been removed.
- Facing pages can be shrunk and displayed together. A unique
  `recto-verso mode' lets you page forward and back by two pages like in a
  book.
- Extended keyboard commands for shrinking pages, setting the shrink factor,
  and closing windows without having to use the mouse.
- Extended dialog boxes; many settings that required editing the setup file
  can now be performed from within the program.
- Better handling of various error conditions.
- Support for CSG level 2 graphics and tpic \specials (mostly).
- German manual included (sorry folks, German only)
- Besides an example (in C) for `remote control' of ASCREEN, the
  distribution contains `FontList', a program which lists the fonts
  used in a document. The source code for this program is included, too.

You may get and use ASCREEN for free. You may also redistribute the
program, as long as you don't make any money off it or pretend that you
wrote it.

ASCREEN 3.2 is available for anonymous FTP from
ftp.math.uni-frankfurt.de [141.2.90.2], directory pub/atari:

	ascr32.zoo	- software, examples, Readme file etc.
	ascr32dv.zoo	- DVI file for (German) user manual
	ascr32tx.zoo	- TeX source code for the manual

(The manual is quite big, and I have separated it from the main
distribution so people who don't read German don't have to fetch it
anyhow. There is a short English introduction in ENGINTRO.TXT.) Some
other goodies, e. g., ready-made FLIB files with the most important
LaTeX fonts and AMSFonts, may be retrieved from there as well.

*Please note that this site is in Germany, Europe, and retrieve the
software only at off-peak times, that is, 1800-0800 hours CET
(UT+0100), or during the weekend.*

There is a mailing list for announcements, bug reports, comments,
questions and general discussion about ASCREEN; send mail to
`ascreen-request@math.uni-frankfurt.de' to subscribe or to find out
more.
