* Kill_Bak *
        This little proggie is to batch kill *.bak files from all or part
of your hard disk. The usual disclaimers  apply! It has been tested on my
hard disk, but you use it on your  own  at your own risk. The program has
only been designed to take 10 levels  of directory structure, as GEM only
recommends eight (128 character path max. including filename).

        If you require any modifications,  drop  me  a line on either the
Holodeck BBS or Ad. Lib BBs.

* Usage *
        If you do not give it any parameters  (or rename it as a tos file
and use it from the  desktop)  it  will  delete  all *.bak files from the
whole of the default disk (usually the one it is on).

        If you wish to delete all *.bak files from a disk, pass the drive
letter as the only parameter (e.g. 'd','f:','a:','c').

        If you wish to delete all *.bak files from part of a disk, pass
the path of the directory at which deletion should start.
All sub-directories of the specified path will also be checked.
(e.g. 'c:\work','c:\work\' will both delete all *.bak files from c:\work
and any sub-directories of c:\work).

        For safety reasons, the program will stop if any file causes an
error on an attempted file deletion.

        This program will not work  with  multitos  (I think) as I didn't
want  to  think  about  attempting  to  delete  open  files.  It  is  not
recommended to run this program while  multi-tasking with file access. If
this  or  any  other  change  is   found   necessary,   contact   me   as
mentioned above. If anyone requires  any  other SMALLish utilities,  drop
me  a  note to say what you want.
