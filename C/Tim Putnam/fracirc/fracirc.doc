        *** Version 1.10, released on the 6th February, 1997 ***
        

***** For upgraders from previous versions *****
Please make sure to completely reinstall this
package and not to use any old DEFAULT.DAT 
files. The program now looks for FRACIRC.DAT
and the contents has changed dramatically.

                         <<< Documentation >>>

	This program is Shareware, and may be freely distributed (provided 
it is kept intact within the original, unaltered, zip file). If however 
you decide you find it useful, a contribution to make my efforts 
worthwhile will be appreciated. Please find details at the end of this

	1. Introduction
	===============
	
	It is about 10 months since I got my first demon internet account, 
and logged on for the very first time, using Oasis 1.35. Everything 
worked, and I eventually found my way to #atari on IRCnet. There the main 
buzz was something called STiK which I had seen given away on a previous 
STF (sob!) cover disk. I loaded all this up and got online with that, 
deciding that this was something I much preferred.

	IRC soon became my favourite net pastime. The only software for 
STiK back then however was a small kludged TOS program by Steve Adams 
(worship due). I had just bought Lattice C and was eager for something to 
try. Here, surely was the perfect opportunity. For the first time I could 
identify something which nobody else had yet done. A fully GEMed IRC client 
for use with STiK.
	In hindsight, an IRC client is /not/ the thing to use as your 
first C project :). However I think I've battled over most of the problems 
on the way. Some time later (ok, I'm lazy <g>) I think I've finally got 
the program to a point where people might find it useful. Provided I have 
a positive response from this first release (I hope there aren't /too/ 
many bugs!) then I will continue to develop this program.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2. Setting up Fracirc
	=====================
	

	When you received Fracirc it should have arrived in ZIP format. 
Having unzipped it, its a good idea to make sure all the files are in the 
same folder. Call it FRACIRC or something (why not?!).
	Your directory should then look like this:
	
		\FRACIRC\DOWNLOAD\    - A download folder for use with DCC
		\FRACIRC\FRACIRC.PRG  - The main program file
		\FRACIRC\FRACIRC.RSC  - The RSC file
		\FRACIRC\FRACIRC.DAT  - A default setup file
		\FRACIRC\FRACIRC.DOC  - This document
		\FRACIRC\COMMANDS.TXT - A list of commands implemented
				        in this version of Fracirc.
		\FRACIRC\NEW.TXT      - New features in this version.
		\FRACIRC\PLANNED.TXT  - Whats coming?
		\FRACIRC\FRACIRC.MCR  - Macro file
		
	When you have made sure that this is your setup, double click on 
FRACIRC.PRG to run the program. You will be presented with a plain window, 
and a menu bar, just like a normal GEM program (thats because it is!). 
Upon running, Fracirc will always try to load the setup file called 
FRACIRC.DAT in the same directory as the program. If this does not exist, 
or if it is the original one from the zip file, you will now want to 
configure Fracirc to your tastes. Go progressively down the Options menu 
in order to make the necessary changes. If you are unfamiliar with IRC 
then here is a quick rundown of what it all means :

Server settings :

	IRC Server - Here put the server you are going to be using. 
Usually one will have been suggested by your Internet Service Provider. If 
not a sample one to try is irc.demon.co.uk

	IRC Port - Every server has different ports to connect to. If you 
have the name of the server a port will almost certainly have been 
specified too. If not, then use 6667 with irc.demon.co.uk.

User settings :
	
	Alias - Everyone goes under another name on IRC. Here put what you 
want to be called (no spaces).
	Username - Reconfigure the defaults if you're not sure.
	Realname -      "       "     "      "    "     "   "
	Hostname -      "       "     "      "    "     "   "


Path settings :

	DCC Receive - This is the path where DCC files will be received 
to. If you cannot remember, or are too lazy to type, the path you wish to 
use, then click on the box. This will bring up a file selector. The path 
should be specified including a trailing \.
	Logfile - Specify a file to log any activity to (if you have it 
switched on that is).

Colour settings :

	In each of these various boxes, enter the colour number to specify 
what colour you wish the described things to come under. The set of 
coloured boxes above the the form indicate the number:colour.


	When all the above is to your satisfaction, go to the File menu, 
select Save Setup. If you wish this setup to be loaded everytime you run 
Fracirc then save it as FRACIRC.DAT in the same directory. Otherwise just 
save the file as whatever you want. To get the setup back you will have to 
use Load Setup from the same menu.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

	3. Getting connected
	====================
	
	You should have already got STiK setup in order to run Fracirc. If 
you do not, its beyond the scope of this documentation to tell you how. 
Refer elsewhere for help on this.

	Connect with STiK and select Connect from the Remote menu. Here 
there will be three boxes. Irc Server, Port, and alias. These relate to 
those options you entered previously in the options menu. If you wish to 
temporarily change these for one connection, then alter them here. 
Everytime you reconnect, they will default back to your original settings.
Select Okay to start the connection process. If the connection fails the 
reason should be reported to you. If you wish to abort at any stage then 
the Escape key will work. The Message Of The Day of the 
server that you have connected to should scroll up the screen, and you're 
in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	4. Use Online
	=============
	
	For details of IRC commands you can utilise please refer to the 
file COMMANDS.TXT included in this archive.

	To connect to a channel go to the channel (!!) menu and select 
open a channel. You will be presented with a dialogue in which you enter 
the name of the channel (preceded by a # still). Unlike a lot of IRC 
clients, Fracirc will not become confused if you fail to connect to the 
channel. It will only register a connection upon confirmation from the 
server.
	When you have connected to the channel the channel name will 
appear as the title of the current window. The info line displays details 
of your current alias, and the current channel.
	Fracirc allows a maximum of ten channels to be opened at once (if 
anyone finds a need for more, then mail me!). It also allows a maximum of 
six windows open (provided the system has that many free). In any window 
you can have up to ten channels, or any combination over different 
windows.
	To cycle channels, either use the menu option or use the commands 
shift+L&R arrow keys. This will cycle through all the channels open, topping 
different windows if necessary. You can also cycle windows, using the menu 
option or the shortcuts ctrl+L&R arrow keys. I think this gives you the 
easiest navigation possible through the program. If you can think of a 
better way of doing it, I'll be very interested to hear!
	Upon completion of your IRCing, use the the connect menu option 
"Disconnect", CTRL-Q, or the command "/quit","/bye", or "/exit".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	5. DCC file transfers
	=====================

	Fracirc has a maximum of ten DCC channels, each of which can 
either be sending or receiving a file.

	When someone sends you a file, an alert box will confirm with you 
whether you wish to receive that file or not. Clicking "Accept" will 
initiate the file transfer. All DCC file transfer information is updated 
in a window of its own (titled "DCC Operations"). If this is not 
already open it will be opened, and relevant information henceforth sent 
to there.
	If you wish to send a file, go to the DCC menu, and select 
Initiate send. You will then get a dialogue box in which you must enter 
the name and path of the file you wish to send. If you click on the box 
you will be presented with a file selector to make it easier. Click on 
Okay and the file will be sent (once more information going to the DCC 
window).
	To view the current DCC transfers use the command "/dcc" and you 
will be given a detailed list. If at any point you wish to abort any 
outstanding transfers then use the command "/reset" and all DCC channels 
will be reset.

	DCC chats
	=========
	
	DCC chatting is now possible! Use /dcc chat <name> to open a chat
to someone. This channel will then be opened into the DCC window. All non 
command messages typed in this window will be passed down the channel. Use 
/dcc close to close the chat.
	If someone initiates a DCC chat to you then you will be alerted 
and asked if you wish to accept.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	6. Future versions
	==================
	
	Please see PLANNED.TXT for some of the features coming up.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	 7. Support/Registration
	 =======================
	 
	 I hope you will find that even at this version, Fracirc has 
something to offer you. Never before on the atari has there been such a 
useable IRC client. Multitasking is not a problem as far as I know. It 
works perfectly with magic although I have had one or two difficulties 
with Geneva. If you find you like this program, and are hoping that I'm 
going to add the facilities mentioned in the previous section, then a 
small shareware contribution would be appreciated. This helps to show me 
not only that you have an interest in my program, but also the care and 
need for such a program. A œ5-œ10 registration fee is suggested, although 
further contributions are welcome. I have not crippled this version in 
any way (it may not be the same in future) but if you register you will 
get: 	Your own slightly personalised copy.
	An immediate update with future versions (minus cripples).
	
	Please send postal orders/cheques made payable to Tim Putnam to 
the following address:
	Tim Putnam (Fracirc), 	1 Mill Lane, Stratton, Dorchester, Dorset, 
				DT2 9RX.
	When posting, please include details of your home address, 
telephone number, email address and computer setup so I can supply you 
with further upgrades and have an idea about who my user group is.
				
	If you have any problems or comments about this program, I can be 
contacted at the email address : Timpy@roseivy.demon.co.uk, or am often to 
be found on #atari under the alias Fraccy.

Good luck!
