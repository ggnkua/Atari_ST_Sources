DOSFS Level 1 Version 1.02      Lewin A.R.W. Edwards (sysadm@zws.com)
=====================================================================

Abstract
========
DOSFS is a FAT-compatible filesystem intended for fairly low-end
embedded applications. It is not the leanest possible implementation
(the leanest FAT implementations operate in << 512 bytes of RAM, with
heavy restrictions). This code strikes a good balance between size
and functionality, with an emphasis on RAM footprint.

Intended target systems would be in the ballpark of 1K RAM, 4K ROM
or more.

Features:
* Supports FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 volumes
* Supports storage devices up to 2048Gbytes in size (LBA32)
* Supports devices with or without MBRs (hard disks vs. floppy disks
  or ZIP drives formatted as "big floppies")
* Supports multiple partitions on disks with MBRs
* Supports subdirectories
* Can be operated with a single global 512-byte sector buffer
* Fully reentrant code (assuming the underlying physical device driver
  is reentrant and global sector buffers are not used). There are no
  global variables in the filesystem
* Does not perform any memory allocation
* Partial support for random-access files

Applications:
* Firmware upgrades
* Failsafe IPL
* Media playback
* Data logging
* Configuration storage

User-Supplied Functions
=======================
You must provide functions to read sectors into memory and write
them back to the target media. The demo suite includes an emulation
module that reads/writes a disk image file (#define HOSTVER pulls
in hostemu.h which wraps the prototypes for these functions).
There are various tools for UNIX, DOS, Windows et al, to create
images from storage media; my preferred utility is dd.

The functions you must supply in your embedded app are:

DFS_ReadSector(unit,buffer,sector,count)
DFS_WriteSector(unit,buffer,sector,count)

These two functions read and write, respectively, "count" sectors of
size SECTOR_SIZE (512 bytes; see below) from/to physical sector
#"sector" of device "unit", to/from the scratch buffer "buffer". They
should return 0 for success or nonzero for failure. In the current
implementation of DOSFS, count will always be 1.

The "unit" argument is designed to permit implementation of multiple
storage devices, for example multiple media slots on a single device,
or to differentiate between master and slave devices on an ATAPI bus.
		 
This code is designed for 512-byte sectors. Although the sector size
is a #define, you should not tinker with it because the vast majority
of FAT filesystems use 512-byte sectors, and the DOSFS code doesn't
support runtime determination of sector size. This will not affect the
vast majority of users.

Example Code
============
Refer to the tests in main.c to see how to call DOSFS functions.
(These tests are all commented out). Note that the only two files
you need to add to your project are dosfs.c and dosfs.h.


Mounting Volumes
================
--If the device has a partition table (practically all removable flash
  media are formatted this way), call DFS_GetPtnStart to get the
  starting sector# of the desired partition. You can optionally also
  retrieve the active state, partition type byte and partition size
  in this step. The reason this step is broken out separately is so
  you can support devices that are formatted like a floppy disk, i.e.
  the volume starts directly at physical sector 0 of the media.

--Call DFS_GetVolInfo to read filesystem info into a VOLINFO structure.
  DFS_GetVolInfo needs to know the unit number and partition starting
  sector (as returned by DFS_GetPtnStart, or 0 if this is a "floppy-
  format" volume without an MBR).

From this point on, the VOLINFO structure is all you'll need - you can
forget the unit and partition start sector numbers.

Enumerating Directory Contents
==============================
--Call DFS_Opendir and supply a path, populated VOLINFO and a
  DIRINFO structure to receive the results. Note - you must PREPOPULATE
  the DIRINFO.scratch field with a pointer to a sector scratch buffer.
  This buffer must remain unmolested while you have the directory open
  for searching.
--Call DFS_GetNext to receive the DIRENT contents for the next directory
  item. This function returns DFS_OK for no error, and DFS_EOF if there
  are no more entries in the directory being searched.
  Before using the DIRENT, check the first character of the name. If it
  is NULL, then this is an unusable entry - call DFS_GetNext again to
  keep searching. LFN directory entries are automatically tagged this way
  so your application will not be pestered by them.

  Note: A designed side-effect of this code is that when you locate the
  file of interest, the DIRINFO.currentcluster, DIRINFO.currentsector
  and DIRINFO.currententry-1 fields will identify the directory entry of
  interest.

Reading a File
==============
--Call DFS_OpenFile with mode = DFS_READ and supply a path and the relevant
  VOLINFO structure. DFS_OpenFile will populate a FILEINFO that can be used
  to refer to the file.
--Optionally call DFS_Seek to set the file pointer. If you attempt to set
  the file pointer past the end of file, the file will NOT be extended. Check
  the FILEINFO.pointer value after DFS_Seek to verify that the pointer is
  where you expect it to be.
--Observe that functionality similar to the "whence" parameter of fseek() can
  be obtained by using simple arithmetic on the FILEINFO.pointer and
  FILEINFO.filelen members.
--Call DFS_ReadFile with the FILEINFO you obtained from OpenFile, and a
  pointer to a buffer plus the desired number of bytes to read, and a
  pointer to a sector-sized scratch buffer. The reason a scratch sector is
  required is because the underlying sector read function doesn't know
  about partial reads.
--Note that a file opened for reading cannot be written. If you need r/w
  access, open with mode = DFS_WRITE (see below).

Writing a file
==============
--Call DFS_OpenFile with mode = DFS_WRITE and supply a path and the relevant
  VOLINFO structure. DFS_OpenFile will populate a FILEINFO that can be used to
  refer to the file.
--Optionally call DFS_Seek to set the file pointer. Refer to the notes on
  this topic in the section on reading files, above.
--Call DFS_WriteFile with the FILEINFO you obtained from OpenFile, and a
  pointer to the source buffer, and a pointer to a sector-sized scratch
  buffer.
--Note that a file open for writing can also be read.
--Files are created automatically if they do not exist. Subdirectories are
  NOT automatically created.
--If you open an existing file for writing, the file pointer will start at
  the beginning of the data; if you want to append, seek to the end before
  writing new data.
--If you perform random-access writes to a file, the length will NOT change
  unless you exceed the file's original length. There is currently no
  function to truncate a file at the current pointer position.
--On-disk consistency is guaranteed when DFS_WriteFile exits, unless your
  physical layer has a writeback cache in it.

Deleting a file
===============
--Call DFS_UnlinkFile
--WARNING: This call will delete a subdirectory (correctly) but will NOT
  first recurse the directory to delete the contents - so you will end up
  with lost clusters.

Notes
=====
Some platforms may require explicit pragmas or attributes to the structures
and unions. For example, arm-gcc will require __attribute__ ((__packed__))
otherwise it will try to be "smart" and place the uint8_t members on 4-byte
boundaries. There is no truly elegant compiler-independent method to get
around this sort of problem.

The code assumes either a von Neumann architecture, or a compiler that
is smart enough to understand where your pointers are aimed and emit
the right kind of memory read and write instructions. The implications
of this statement depend on your target processor and the compiler you
are using. Be very careful not to straddle bank boundaries on bank-
switched memory systems.

Physical 32-bit sector numbers are used throughout. Therefore, the
CHS geometry (if any) of the storage media is not known to DOSFS. Your
sector r/w functions may need to query the CHS geometry and perform
mapping.

File timestamps set by DOSFS are always 1:01:00am on Jan 1, 2006. If
your system has a concept of real time, you can enhance this.

FILEINFO structures contain a pointer to the corresponding VOLINFO
used to open the file, mainly in order to avoid mixups but also to
obviate the need for an extra parameter to every file read/write. DOSFS
assumes that the VOLINFO won't move around. If you need to move or
destroy VOLINFOs pertaining to open files, you'll have to fix up the
pointer in the FILEINFO structure yourself.

The subdirectory delimiter is a forward slash ( '/' ) by default. The
reason for this is to avoid the common programming error of forgetting
that backslash is an escape character in C strings; i.e. "\MYDIR\FILE"
is NOT what you want; "\\MYDIR\\FILE" is what you wanted to type. If you
are porting DOS code into an embedded environment, feel free to change
this #define.

DOSFS does not have a concept of "current directory". A current directory
is owned by a process, and a process is an operating system concept.
DOSFS is a filesystem library, not an operating system. Therefore, any
path you provide to a DOSFS call is assumed to be relative to the root of
the volume.

There is no call to close a file or directory that is open for reading or
writing. You can simply destroy or reuse the data structures allocated for
that operation; there is no internal state in DOSFS so no cleanup is
necessary. Similarly, there is no call to close a file that is open for
writing. (Observe that dosfs.c has no global variables. All state information
is stored in data structures provided by the caller).

MAX_PATH is defined as 64. MS-type DOS filesystems support 128 characters
or more in paths. You can increase this define, but it may GREATLY
increase memory requirements.

VFAT long filenames are not supported. There is a certain amount of
patent controversy about them, but more importantly they don't really
belong in the scope of a "minimalist embedded filesystem".

Improving Performance
=====================
Read performance is fairly good, but can be improved by implementing read
caching on the FAT (see below) and, depending on your hardware platform,
possibly by implementing multi-sector reads.

Write performance may benefit ENORMOUSLY from platform-specific
optimization, especially if you are working with a flash media type that
has a large erase block size. While it is not possible to offer detailed
platform-independent advice, my general advice is to implement writeback
caching on the FAT area. One method for doing this would be to have a
cache system that lives in the DFS_ReadSector/WriteSector functions (on
top of the physical sector r/w functions) and is initially switched off.
Once you have called DFS_GetVolInfo, you then extract the VOLINFO.fat1
and VOLINFO.rootdir parameters and pass them to your caching layer.
Sectors >= fat1 and < rootdir should be cached. The cache strategy is
determined by the physical storage medium underlying the filesystem.

CACHING HINT:
Observe that there will be numerous read-modify-write operations in the
region from VOLINFO.fat1 through VOLINFO.fat1+VOLINFO.secperfat-1, but
in the region from VOLINFO.fat1+VOLINFO.secperfat through VOLINFO.rootdir
there will ONLY be write operations.

Platform Compatibility
======================
DOSFS was derived from code originally written for ARM7TDMI but
designed to be portable. It has been tested on AVR (using avrgcc),
MSP430 (using Rowley's CrossWorks) and PPC603e (using gcc); the host
test suite has also been validated on x86 using gcc under both Cygwin
and 32-bit Fedora Core 4 Linux.

TODO list
=========
* Add function to create subdirectory
* Make DFS_UnlinkFile recognize non-empty subdirectories
* Support "fast write" files where the FAT is not updated, for
  logging applications where latency is important.

Test cases for V1.02
