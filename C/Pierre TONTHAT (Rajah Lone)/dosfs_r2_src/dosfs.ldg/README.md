# dosfs.ldg

Library using the LDG system and the dosfs functions, only for floppy disks images (hard disk support is removed), taken from ggnkuaâ€™s [Jacknife Total Commander plugin](https://github.com/ggnkua/Jacknife/), and modified a little to rename files/folders (and volume name if present in the FAT).

Used by: KK Commander to handle ST and MSA floppy disks images. 

Other programs can use it, please read KKcmd GFA sources (dfs_ functions) as exemple.
