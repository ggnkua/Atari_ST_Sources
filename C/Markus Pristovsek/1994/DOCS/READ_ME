Ok, here is the long awaited:

            english very short manual for DVI 2.20
            ======================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Needings
   ~~~~~~~~

There are at least some things you will probably need to install DVI. None 
of them is absolute neccessary, I know of people using DVI without, altough 
I could not figure out, why this still makes sences.

1.)   An Atari ST or compatible (i.e. STE, TT, Falcon, Medusa, ...)
      (Else place your cup on the disk or make a nice lamp of it!)

2.)   At least 1 MB and a harddisk.

3.)   You will need PK-fonts, organized in a certain structure. This is 
      usally part of 4.). You can also pack all you fonts in an emTeX-Flib!

4.)   A TeX-System and a Metafont is a good company to DVI (or the other way 
      round). I highly recommend Lindner-Tex: Fast, reliable and a nice 
      GEM-Metafont. (Shareware)

5.)   A good idea is a printer (but really not neccessary).

6.)   Another very nice thing is an email-adress. The author's one is
            prissi@marie.physik.tu-berlin.de
      where to complain, please. (This is Germany, so even email may take 
      up to two days, depends on how often the mails are converted.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   How to do
   ~~~~~~~~~

The installation is simple (if you compare it to your last tax declaration). 
It consist of three steps which should be performed in chronological order 
(but must not).

First, prepare a pot of tea to relax.

Second, get a good friend with vast knowlegde to help. (My email-adress will 
do it to in emergency. But the feedback would not be very fast.)

Third and most important step: Install DVI. If it crashes after beiing 
doubleklicked, then go back to step 2 and complain (check your system 
before!)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Step three in detail
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy all the files where you want them to be. (Should not be a problem.) Make 
sure that DVI_ENG.RSC is renamed to DVI.RSC and is put either in your 
resource-folder (if you have one) or in the same directory like DVI.APP. It is 
also a good idea to rename LINDNER.CNF (or STRUNK.CNF) to DVI.CNF and put it 
also in this directory.

Then run DVI. It will load its default parameters from DVI.CNF. These you 
must change. First you change the Settings.

If you own a color monitor with 600*200, you shold swith color on. But more 
important is the selection of the TeX-system, that means how your fonts are 
organized. CS-TeX are all the TeXs that are freeware and not Lindner. CS-TeX 
= Strunk-TeX! PasTeX is from the Amiga. I think emTeX on the PC uses the same 
font organisation sheme like CS-TeX. The rest should be Ok.

Then go to Borders and set the Resolution in dpi your fonts have been 
gernerated.

Wasn't difficult? Then go to Paths.

Here are all the important paths are to be set. If you own Lindner-TeX and 
your TeX is on E: then you are lucky: Nothing to change. BUT if not:

The important path is the font path. It consist of two parts. The general one 
which is the same for all different devices and the special one for the 
device, which is now set up (the screen, I presume). For CS-Tex this is 
"fonts"! For Lindner-TeX, here only the ending belongs: "scr"!

The font-path is "E:\TeX\PRTFONTS" for Lindner-TeX and "E:\TeX\FONTS" for 
CS-TeX. Beware, the must not be an "\" at the end of the paths!

Now, change the rest and save it under DVI.CNF. And after this exhausting 
hour you can save the time by the fast preview you are getting now.

If you have been not rewarded by the procedure: Go back to step 2 and try 
again...

Hope this helps,
