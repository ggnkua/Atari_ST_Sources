
		-------------------------------------------------------
		History and Buggs fixed about The Installer/UnInstaller
		-------------------------------------------------------
		
		
		
Release 1.0:	* It was the very first program release.

Release 1.1:	* A alert box always occured at the end of installation
		with the old TOS 2.0:
		
		"The aes cannot support the icons desktop"
		
		This message now will appear only if icons desktop are required
		into the install.dat script.
		
		* In some case, a bus error occured when the first dialog box was
		closed just before to opening the enter path dialog box.
		I hope this bugg really fixed (!)
