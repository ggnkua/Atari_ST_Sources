
          2.1  )s0s3BThis Manual

          This manual covers the basic features for the Frankenstein
          cross assemblers.  The specific features for a given
          target architecture will be covered in the appendix for
          that cross-assembler.

          2.2  )s0s3BNotation

          Items enclosed in [] are optional. The "[]" are not
          entered in the source statement or command line, and are
          just a notation.


          name [-o binary] [-l listing] [-s symbols] [-d] input

          The optional operands on the command line can be in any
          order.

          3.1  )s0s3BInput File

          The input file must appear after the optional entries on
          the command line.  Only one input file is used with this
          version. If the file name is a single minus sign, the
          standard input is used.

          3.2  )s0s3BListing File

               -l filename

          An annotated listing will only be produced if an optional
          list file is provided, otherwise the error messages and
          summary will be output to the console.  There is no
          required suffix or default extension for the file name.


               -h filename or
               -o filename

          The binary output will only be produced if the optional
          file is provided.  See the section in the description of
          the output files for the format of the data records.  If
          any errors occur, the hex output file is either not
          created or is deleted depending on whether the error
          occurred in the input or output phases of processing.
          There is no required suffix or default extension for the
          file name.

          3.4  )s0s3BSymbol Listing File

               -s filename

          The symbol table is dumped with one entry per line for
          whatever use is desired, normally with the sort utility to
          produce symbol listings in a different order that the one
          provided.  See the section on the output files for a
          description of the format.  There is no required suffix or
          default extension for the file name.


          The -d debug option

             - Saves the intermediate file in the /usr/tmp directory

             - Calls the abort() system call to produce a "core"
               file


               assembler name or
               -p string

          Some of these assemblers support related families of
          processors, and can be limited to specific subsets of the
          total instructions by sending the processor number or name
          as an operand.  The operand is scanned for unique
          substrings which identify the target processor.  The
          operand can be either the name of the executable, or the
          operand of the -p option, with the operand of the -p
          having precedence.  The name of the executable may not
          available in some operating systems.  The CPU pseudo-
          operation has precedence over both the name scan and the
          -p operand [see the appendix for the specific processor].


          The source input is a text file a with one statement per
          line.  Adjacent symbols must be separated by spaces or
          tabs or special characters such as operators or
          parenthesis.

          4.1  )s0s3BInput Lines

          Source lines consist of up to four parts

               [Label] [Opcode [Operands] ] [; comments]

          Labels    A symbol that starts in the first column of the
                    line is a label. A label is used as the defining
                    instance of a symbol, the place where it is
                    given a value, normally the address of the
                    location in memory where the data generated by
                    the rest of the statement is placed.  Labels are
                    optional for target machine instructions
                    statements.  Label are required on some pseudo-
                    operations, and are not allowed on others.

          Opcode    The first symbol in a line that doesn't start in
                    column 1 is treated as an opcode, all symbols
                    after that are treated as symbol references.
                    Opcodes are treated as a separate set of
                    symbols, so a label can have the same character
                    string as an opcode. Opcodes are converted to
                    uppercase for comparison, so case is not
                    significant.

          Operands  The rest of the line is the operands associated
                    with the opcode.  These are expressions, symbol
                    references, or other syntactic elements
                    determined by the specific operation.

          Comments  Comments start with a ';', anything on a line
                    after a semicolon is ignored.  Lines that
                    consist of only a comment are treated as empty
                    lines.

          4.2.1  )s1SSymbols  Symbols are strings of characters.  The
          first of which is one of the following.

               A-Z a-z ! & ^ _ ~

          The rest of the string consists of zero or more of the
          following.

               0-9 A-Z a-z ! & ^ _ ~

          There is no length limit to symbols, all characters are


          4.3.1  )s1SSymbols  A symbol reference is the name of an item


          The End statement terminates the processing of the current
          file.  For an include file, the file is closed and input
          resumes in the file that contained the include statement.
          For the main file, processing shifts to the following
          passes of the assembly.  The end statement is optional, as
          the end of file condition is treated in the same fashion.
          If the optional label is present, The symbol specified is
          used as the execution start address that is output in the
          binary file. The symbol must be used as a label somewhere
          else in the file.  When more than one start address is

          The include statement shifts input from the current file
          to the file specified. Input resumes from the file
          containing the include statement when the end of file or
          the End statement is reached in the included file.
          Includes can be nested up to the limits of the include
          file stack, currently a limit of 20 deep, or the limits of
          the operating system, whichever comes first.  Includes can
          be recursive, i.e., a file can include itself.  If a file
          cannot be opened, either do to an bad filename or a lack
          of system resources, an error is issued.

          for the existence of a symbol than to rely on the
          noncomputability of an expression.

          IF statements can be nested to a depth determined by a

          ignored.  If the IF expression failed, the statements
          between the ELSE and the ENDI are assembled.  Labels are
