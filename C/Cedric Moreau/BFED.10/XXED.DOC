	XXED copyright Jim Charlton 1989.  XXED is freely distributable
provided that this file is distributed with the source and executable
code.  No-one may charge a fee for the executable or source code, nor for
distribution of this code.

	Version 1.2 is the third version of this program and all reports of 
problems, bugs or suggestions for improvements should be forwarded to the
address given above.

	No garantees, written or implied are made as to the suitability of
this program for any particular purpose.  Anyone who uses it, does so at
their own risk.

	The source code was compiled using Megamax Laser C version 2.0.  The
program was tested primarily on a 1040ST (Nov 1985 ROMS), monochrome and
has not been extensively tested in colour, although it should work in
colour.

	The file FNCTLST.DOC contains a list of all of the functions defined
in the source code with very brief descriptions of what they do.  While
the source code is not extensively documented, it should be readable by
an experience C programmer.  The basic program structure is modelled after
the example code that comes with the Laser C compiler.  Each file has its
own window and workspace.  A linked list is used to keep track of the
open windows.  Each window has a file buffer which is a linked list of 
blocks.  Using linked lists makes memory management easier and speeds
up inserts and deletes.

	The following very brief instructions should suffice to enable you to
use the program.

Features:
	1.	Can create and edit files of any format.
	2.	Can insert or replace bytes using hexadecimal or ascii input.
	3.	Displays simultaneously in hex and ascii.
	4.	Can cut, copy, paste and erase.
	5.	Can search or search/replace on hex or ascii strings.
	6.	Full GEM interface.  Open up to 7 files in individual windows.
	
Instructions:
	Start the program and inspect the menu entries.  Under file you can
open an existing file or start editing a new file.  When you open a file,
a copy of the file is made in ram which can be edited.  This program is 
not a disk editor, and does not change the copy of the file on the disk
until you specifically save the file.  Having opened a file, you can edit
in hexadecimal or ascii mode.  The input mode is switched by clicking the
mouse in the hex or ascii display area.  You can either insert or replace
bytes.  The insert/replace mode is toggled with the insert key or the edit
menu.  Selected text can be marked using the cursor and the mark menu or
by dragging the mouse in either the hex or ascii display area (Only the
hex display is marked).  The marked area can be copied or cut to a
cutbuffer, or erased using the edit menu.  Text which has been copied or
cut to the cutbuffer can be pasted into the file at the cursor position
using the paste command in the edit menu.  The paste function will either
insert at the cursor, or overwrite beginning at the cursor, depending
on whether you are in insert or replace mode.  Insert or replace mode
can be chosen by the edit menu and is toggled by the insert key.
You can search forwards and backwards for ascii strings from the search
menu.  You can also search and replace from the search menu.  You can use
the cutbuffer as either the search or replace pattern.  In this way you
can also search or search/replace on hex strings (even those containing
NULL (hex 00) charlacters).
  The info menu provides the length of the file and the position of the 
cursor in the file.  The print option under the file menu will 
print the file in the active window or the marked text (if any) in the
active window.  Pressing any key during printing will abort printing.
