
SUNCLOCK for the ATARI-ST.
I was just wondering if it could run on an Atari ST. Tried to use
simple GEM-calls, so no hacking for speed is done.

Original readme:


Sunclock is a SunView program  that  displays  a  map  of  the  Earth,
showing  the  portion  illuminated  by  the  Sun  at the current time,
properly corrected for the season.  The  program  initially  comes  up
iconic  (126x63)  and can be opened into a larger (640x320) pixel map.

A SunView menu allows animated displays that show the passage  of  day
and  night, the changes in the seasons, and even the precession of the
equinoxes as year follows year.

I saw a program like this running under NeWS, and couldn't sleep until
I had one for my SunView screen.  It seems to work on Sun  3,  4,  and
386i  architectures,  on any SunView later than 3.5.  It's been tested
most recently on a Sun 3/260 running SunOS 4.0.3.

Enjoy!
