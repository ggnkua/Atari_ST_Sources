- Atari version:
  Gem routines updated for gemlib-0.40
  Tool to build DSP object file

-------------------------------- 0.27 -----------------------------------

- Document the '@filename' parameter, present in Doom from the beginning,
  which allows you to store parameters in a file. I did not know that
  it was present in the source !

- Atari version:

  Modified includes files. Mint specific includes are now <mint/*.h>

-------------------------------- 0.26 -----------------------------------

- Atari version:
  sting.h missing in previous version, added.
  Source modified to be 68000 compilable, and can use c2p 4 bits in
  320x200x4 bits, should run on any ST with a 100Mhz processor and enough
  memory :-)
  Thanks to Xavier Joubert for help in debugging and testing
  I don't have time to test it extensively, so it is an exercise left to
  the reader...

-------------------------------- 0.25 -----------------------------------

- Atari version:
  Added Sting support for network and optimizations from Ronald Andersson
  (Thanks!)
  Use '-network [unix,sting]` to choose your favorite IP stack. 'unix' is
  the MintNet sockets on Atari.

-------------------------------- 0.24 -----------------------------------

- Modified to be cross-compilable for target m68k-atari-mint
  Just edit the makefile and put cross=y. Some other adjustments may be
  necessary (CROSSBINDIR_IS_y value is the path to cross-compilation tools).
  The new Atari executable is now built with gcc-2.8.1 .

- Atari version:
  Added network support (TCP/IP via MintNet), not tested

-------------------------------- 0.23 -----------------------------------

- Atari version:
  Corrected a bug in Xbios routine for 8 bits mode.

-------------------------------- 0.22 -----------------------------------

- Atari version:
  Corrected a bug in the c2p routine. It was modified to c2p in a screen
  wider than 320 pixels, and was buggy. So it was not working on TT.

-------------------------------- 0.21 -----------------------------------

- After having a look in ADoom sources (Amiga Doom port from Peter McGavin),
  I found that there were still not corrected bugs:

  src/dstrings.c:
	missing commas for end of the game messages (may cause crash when
	you quit the game).
  src/info.c,include/info.h:
	last element of sprname array is not NULL (tested in r_things.c)
  src/st_stuff.c:
	corrected IDCLEVxx cheat code for commercial WAD
  src/hu_stuff.c,src/wi_stuff.c:
	corrected language test: if (french) -> if (language==french)

- Separated string version in ./src/i_version.c
- Added zoom routine
- Added 32 bits support
- Tics are calculated now after complete redraw of screen:
  So now, the time taken to do the final display (copy,double buffer,zoom) is
  taken into account.

- Linux version:
	Svgalib:
	  '-zoomscreen'	for fullscreen mode
	  '-videomode <n>' to choose a video mode
	X11:
	  added program name in window title.
	  now window resize works with the zoom routine.

- Atari version:
	Added bios reading keys
	Xbios
	  '-zoomscreen'	for fullscreen mode
	  '-videomode <n>' to choose a video mode on Falcon.
	Vdi:
	  '-zoomscreen'	for fullscreen mode
	  '-novavdi' to force 15 bits in 16 bits mode
	  modified by Xavier Joubert:
	    - save/restore palette in 256 colours mode.
	    - black border around displayed zone. 
	    - test if AES is present or not.	

-------------------------------- 0.20 -----------------------------------

- Put original documentations files from linuxdoom sources in ./doc
  Added 'Copying': GNU GPL text file (this is the new license).

- Sound samples are now cached, so only used sounds stay in memory
  (Should now work on 4Mb Atari machines).

- Dynamic system routines
  '-sound','-video','-music','-keyboard','-joystick,'-joypad','-mouse'
  can select your preferred routine. Missing features on your system are
  automatically set 'off'. Now you can easily add new routines.

  Atari version:
	-keyboard <param>	param =	ikbd,off
	-mouse <param>		param = ikbd,off
	-joystick <param>	param = ikbd,off
	-joypad <param>		param = on,off
	-sound <param>		param = dma8,sndserver,off
	-video <param>		param = xbios,vdi,off

	ikbd:		Ikbd-6301 interrupt routines for Atari Falcon/TT.
	dma8:		Timer A sound interrupt routine for Atari Falcon/TT.
	sndserver:	The sound server in a multitasking OS.
	joypad on:	Use joypad ports on Atari Falcon.
	xbios:		Xbios display on Atari Falcon/TT.
	vdi:		VDI display for all Atari and clones.
			Use '-nofastblit' to allocate VDI buffers in ST-Ram
			instead of Fast-Ram.

  Linux version:
	-keyboard <param>	param =	svgalib,x11,off
	-mouse <param>		param =	svgalib,x11,off
	-sound <param>		param = audio,sndserver,off
	-video <param>		param = svgalib,x11,off

	svgalib:	Svgalib routines for Linux/x86
	x11:		X11 routines for Linux
	audio:		Linux audio device routine
	sndserver:	Use the sound server

-------------------------------- 0.15 -----------------------------------

- Corrected bugs in 24 bits mode
- Moved assembly m68k sources to ./src/m68k

Atari version:
  - Added VDI display routine from Johan Klockars
    Use '-pixelinv' to use byte reversed pixels in TrueColour.

-------------------------------- 0.14 -----------------------------------

- Changed include <values.h> in m_bbox.h by include "doomtype.h"
  The file values.h may not be available on all systems.

Atari version:
  - Corrected sound mixing bug. Sound is clear now.
  - Corrected interrupts bug (using the mouse could hang everything).
  - Added pro-controller joypad keys (X,Y,Z,L,R)

-------------------------------- 0.13 -----------------------------------

- Changed define -DBLBUFFER in boolean variable dblbuffer

Atari version:
  - Use '-video-8' to force 8 bits mode on Falcon.
  - Corrected a bug in joypad routine (reported by users)
  - Sound with 8 bits DMA (TT and Falcon) (required by users)
    On a standard Falcon, mixing 8 voices take to much time, and the
    keyboard routine can lose control, because the sound routine as a
    higher interrupt level. Avoid using mouse: it generates too many
    keyboard interrupts. 

Svgalib version:
  - use '-video-8' to force 320x240 double buffer mode (Mode X).

-------------------------------- 0.12 -----------------------------------

Atari version:
  - Rewritten keyboard routine
    mouse,joystick and joypad (on Falcon) are usable to play.
  - Removed bogus linux sound routine (slow down under TOS (2x slower !)).

-------------------------------- 0.11 -----------------------------------

Atari version:
  - Falcon version can use 8 bitplanes mode : '-falcon8' switch
  - Should now work on Atari TT in 320x480x8 bits mode (not tested)

-------------------------------- 0.10 -----------------------------------

- Wiping screens now works in double buffer.

Svgalib version:
  - Now can double-buffer in 320x240 mode X style, if compiled for.
    Switchs -svga[15,16,24] don't work in this mode !

-------------------------------- 0.09 -----------------------------------

- Now display tics with '-devparm'
  (one tic = 1/35 sec.)
- If $HOME is defined, configuration and games are saved in "$HOME/.doom/"
  else in "./"

Svgalib version:
  - You can use [-svga15,-svga16,-svga24] to enable 320x200x[15,16,24 bits]
    mode if available (not tested).

Atari version:
  - more ASM routs to get (a bit) faster

-------------------------------- 0.08 -----------------------------------

Linux/x86/PC and [Mint,Tos]/m68k/F30 common sources 
  - Back to C only for this version
  - Some ASM routs for Atari version
  - No more framerate displayed

-------------------------------- 0.07 -----------------------------------

Linux version:
  - Bug in Makefile: Math library was not linked in Svgalib version

-------------------------------- 0.06 -----------------------------------
	
- Recalculated light shading : looks better now

Atari version:
  - VBL rate displayed only if '-devparm' present
  - Crash sometimes when exiting (because of non present sound code):
    this should be ok now
  - Network library removed (was not used) : smaller binary

-------------------------------- 0.05 -----------------------------------
	
Atari version:
  - In VGA mode (320x240), screen is now correctly used. This could
    have provided some bugs.

-------------------------------- 0.04 -----------------------------------

- The sky texture is now correct in Ultimate DOOM.
- Switchs have now their correct texture when used (Ultimate DOOM).

-------------------------------- 0.03 -----------------------------------

- The status bar is better refreshed.
	
Atari version:
  - Modified to work on VGA: 320x200 display in a 320x240 screen.

-------------------------------- 0.02 -----------------------------------
	
- In invulnerability mode, palette is correct. It was a bug in original
  DOOM sources.
- Palettes have been recalculated for TrueColor mode: light shading is
  nicer (dark green is really dark green, and not dark grey like in 256
  colour mode).

Atari version:
  - Configuration is saved in the file "doom.cfg" automatically created
    when you run DOOM.
  - SHIFT key for running works now.

-------------------------------- 0.01 -----------------------------------

- Display is now correct in low detail.
- Demos management is done for old IWADs.
- Dots are correctly displayed when started (call of R_Init function).

Atari version:
  - Internal assembler manager for keyboard, mouse, joystick, 35hz timer.
  - Display 256 colors -> True Color, then directly in True Color, and
    then double-buffer.
