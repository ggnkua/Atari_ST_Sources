NAME
     lpflush - clears the /dev/lp buffer


SYNOPSIS
     lpflush


DESCRIPTION
     lpflush will discard all data stored in the /dev/lp  buffer.  It  can  be
     used  to  abort  printing  when  things  are going very wrong. Of course,
     lpflush won't clear the data stored in the printer's internal buffer, but
     this  one is usually small enough. You may need to send a reset string to
     the printer, especially if you're printing graphics.
