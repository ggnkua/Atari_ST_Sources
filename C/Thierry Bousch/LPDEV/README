Dear MiNT-users,

here is an installable device driver for the Centronics port.  Just
execute the program "lpdev.ttp" (better yet, put it in you mint.cnf
file) and it will install the /dev/lp device. 

This driver is interrupt-driven (there are no busy loops) and therefore
shouldn't hog the processor too much.  Top reveals that the command

	cat file > /dev/lp

takes less than 1% of CPU time (when other tasks are running, of
course).  The command "cp file /dev/lp" would be less efficient, because
cp copies one byte at a time, while cat copies large chunks of data.

The device uses a 24-kbyte circular buffer.  This can be modified by
altering the BUFSIZE variable in lpdev.c.  Please choose an even size,
otherwise the bit-copies won't be word-aligned and it will be much
slower. 

I have also included a small utility called "lpflush.ttp" to clear the
/dev/lp queue, so everything should be ready for use. Read the man pages
for more information.

Enjoy,
