Operation
---------
This module reads GEM images with between 1 and 8 bitplanes and 
displays the image provided the video hardware is available.
ThingIMG looks for an editable ASCII file called THINGIMG.INF in the 
user Home directory which understands the following keywords:

Cachetyp=[off|readonly|on]
CacheDir=[path, where the cache files are saved]

The cache enables images in device dependent format to be created 
which accelerated the loading process, especially with large images.

[off] switches this function off
[readonly] allows images already in the cache-directory to be used but 
no new images will be created.
[on] allows new images to be created as required.
If no THINGIMG.INF is found the cache will not be available.
