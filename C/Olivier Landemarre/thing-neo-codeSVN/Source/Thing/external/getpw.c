/*Subject:  v08i080:  Public-domain getpw*(3) routinesNewsgroups: mod.sourcesApproved: mirror!rsSubmitted by: emoryu1!emoryu2!arnold (Arnold D. Robbins)Mod.sources: Volume 8, Issue 80Archive-name: getpwHere is public domain re-implementation of the getpwent(3) routines. I havenot included a manual page, since every Unix system has one. I also haven'teven bothered to include a <pwd.h> file; you should be able to use the oneon your system.There is one additional routine:      setpwfile (file)      char *file;which will cause the routines to find password records from a file besides/etc/passwd.  This is useful should you need to use saved password files,for instance in doing Unix accounting, where you wish to keep info around onold accounts, but take the old accounts out of the live password file.(Can you guess why I just whipped these up?)To switch files, call setpwfile as the very first thing, or call endpwent(),then setpwfile ("/some/file").Anyway, I hope this is useful to somene out there.Arnold Robbinsarnold@emoryu1.{CSNET, UUCP, ARPA, BITNET}*//* minorly customized by ERS for the MiNT library *//****************************************************************//* Module name:   getpw.c                                       *//* Library name:  mintlibs for Atari ST                         *//* Author:        Hildo Biersma (boender@dutiws.twi.tudelft.nl) *//* Date:          January 29, 1993                              *//* Revision:      1 (add password aging, add System V routines, *//*                   include three man pages, add example code) *//****************************************************************//*NAME    getpw - get name from UIDSYNOPSIS    #include <pwd.h>    int getpw(int uid, char *buf);DESCRIPTION    getpw searches the password file for a user id number that    equals uid, copies the line of the password file in which uid    was found into the array pointed to by buf, and returns 0.    getpw returns non-zero if uid cannot be found.    This routine is included only for compatibility with old UN*X    systems and should not be used in any new programs; see    getpwent for routines to use instead.FILES    /etc/passwdSEE ALSO    getpwentAUTHOR    Hildo Biersma, with the help of a UN*X System V man page.*//*NAME    getpwent, getpwuid, getpwnam, setpwent, endpwent,    fgetpwent, setpwfile - get password file entrySYNOPSIS    #include <stdio.h>  // Only needed for fgetpwent    #include <pwd.h>    struct passwd *getpwent(void);    struct passwd *getpwuid(int uid);    struct passwd *getpwnam(const char *name);    void setpwent(void);    void endpwent(void);    struct passwd *fgetpwent(FILE *f);    void setpwfile(const char *name);DESCRIPTION    getpwent, getpwuid and getpwnam each returns a pointer to an    object containing the broken-out fields of a line in the    /etc/passwd file.    Each line in the file contains a "passwd" structure, declared    in the <pwd.h> header file. For the definition of this structure    and the meaning of the fields, see the <pwd.h> header file.    getpwent when first called returns a pointer to the first    passwd structure in the file; thereafter, it returns a pointer    to the next passwd structure in the file; so successive calls    can be used to search the entire file.    getpwuid searches from the beginning of the file until a    numerical user ID is found matching uid is found and returns    a pointer to the particular structure in which it was found.    Thus, it cannot be found to search for several users having    duplicate numerical user IDs.    getpwnam searches from the beginning of the file until a    login name matching name is found and returns a pointer to    the particular structure in which it was found.    If an EOF or an error is encountered on reading, getpwent,    getpwuid and getpwnam return a NULL pointer.    A call to setpwent has the effect of rewinding the password    file to allow repeated searches.    endpwent may be called to close the password file when    processing is complete.    fgetpwent returns a pointer to the next passwd structure in    the stream f, which matches the format of /etc/passwd.    setpwfile will set the password file to be read from by all    the above routines except fgetpwent.   FILES    /etc/passwdSEE ALSO    getlogin, getgrent, putpwentNOTES    All information is contained in a static area, so it must    be copied if it is to be saved.    Password aging is supported.    In order not to suffer from possible future changes in the    format of the passwd file or in the passwd structure,    these routines should always be used for reading from file,    while putpwent should always be used for writing to file.    These routines expect the passwd file to be of type text,    and can therefore read both DOS and UN*X format files.AUTHORS    Arnold D. Robbins - original version    Eric Smith        - adapted for the mintlibs    Hildo Biersma     - included System V routines and password aging*//*PASSWORD AGINGDESCRIPTION    Password aging is in effect for a particular user if his    encrypted password in the password file is followed by a    comma and a non-null string of characters from the     alphabet (., /, 0-9, A-Z, a-z) also used for the encrypted    password. (Such a string must be introduced in the first    place by the super-user.)    The first character of the age, M say, denotes the maximum    number of weeks for which a password is valid. A user who    attempts to login after his password has expired should be    forced to supply a new one. The next character, N say,    denotes the minimum number of weeks which must expire    before the password may be changed. The remaining characters    define the week (counted from the beginning of 1970) when    the password was last changed. (A null string is equivalent    to zero.) M and N have numerical values in the range 0-63    that correspond to the 64-character alphabet mentioned    above (i.e., / = 1 week; z = 63 weeks). If M = N = 0    (derived from the string . or ..) the user should be forced    to change his password the next time he logs in (and the    "age" should disappear from his entry in the password file).    If N > M (signified, e.g., by the string /.) only the    super-user should be able to change the password.SEE ALSO    a64l, getpwent, putpwentNOTE    The compliance with password aging in MiNT is a joke, since    users are not forced to login. Also, the current login program    supplied in init(1) does not support password aging. This may    change in the future.*//*  FIXME:  - test *thoroughly*  - write example code for modifying passwd files, include below*/      #include <stdio.h>/*#include <pwd.h>#include <unistd.h>*/#include <string.h>#include <stdlib.h>/*#include <types.h>*/#include "pwd.h"typedef _UID_T uid_t; /* user id type*/static char const *pwdfile = "U:/etc/passwd"; /* default passwd file */static FILE *fp = NULL;static struct passwd curentry;    /* static data to return */static int nextent __PROTO((FILE *fp));/* Get name from uid */int getpw(int uid, char *buf){  FILE *pw;  char line[256]; /* Assume this will always be enough */  char *ptr;  if ((pw = fopen("U:/etc/passwd", "r")) == NULL)    return(-1); /* Failure: file could not be opened */  line[255] = 0x00;  while (!feof(pw))  {    fgets(line, 255, pw);    if ((ptr = strchr(line, ':')) != NULL) /* Password field found */      if ((ptr = strchr(ptr + 1, ':')) != NULL) /* UID field found */        if (atoi(ptr + 1) == uid)        {          strcpy(buf, line);          return(0); /* Success */        }  }  return(-1); /* Failure */} /* End of getpw() *//* Set the name of the passwd file */void setpwfile(char *cp){  endpwent();  if (cp != NULL)    pwdfile = cp;} /* End of setpwfile() *//* Rewind the passwd file */void setpwent(){  if (fp != NULL)    rewind(fp);  else if ((fp = fopen (pwdfile, "r")) == NULL)  {#ifdef VERBOSE    fprintf (stderr, "setpwent: %s non-existant or unreadable.\n", pwdfile);#endif  }} /* End of setpwent() *//* End passwd file processing */void endpwent(){  if (fp != NULL)  {    fclose (fp);    fp = NULL;  }} /* End of endpwent() *//* Get the next passwd entry from the passwd file */struct passwd *getpwent(){  if (fp == NULL)  {    setpwent();    if (fp == NULL)      return(NULL);  }  if (nextent(fp) == 0)    return(NULL);  else    return(&curentry);} /* End of getpwent() *//* Get first passwd entry from file with pw_uid matching uid */#ifdef __STDC__struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t uid)#elsestruct passwd *getpwuid(uid)uid_t uid;#endif{  setpwent();  while (nextent(fp) != 0)    if (curentry.pw_uid == uid) {      endpwent();      return(&curentry);    }  endpwent();  return(NULL);} /* End of getpwuid() *//* Get first passwd entry from file with pw_name matching name */struct passwd *getpwnam(const char *name){  setpwent();  while (nextent(fp) != 0)    if (strcmp(curentry.pw_name, name) == 0) {      endpwent();      return(&curentry);    }  endpwent();  return(NULL);} /* End of getpwnam() *//* Read the next password structure from a given file */struct passwd *fgetpwent(FILE *f){  if (f == NULL)    return(NULL); /* Failure */  if (nextent(f) != 0)    return(&curentry); /* Success */  return(NULL); /* Failure */} /* End of fgetpwent() */#if defined(atarist) || defined(__SOZOBON__)static char savbuf[256];  /* BUFSIZ seems bigger than necessary! */#elsestatic char savbuf[BUFSIZ];#endif/* Static function getting next entry from passwd file */    static int nextent(FILE *fp){  char *cp;  if (fp == NULL)  {    setpwent();    if (fp == NULL)      return(0);  }  while (fgets(savbuf, (int)sizeof(savbuf), fp) != NULL)  {    curentry.pw_age = NULL;    for (cp = savbuf; ((*cp != 0x00) && (*cp != ':')); cp++)      ;    curentry.pw_name = savbuf;    *cp++ = 0x00;    curentry.pw_passwd = cp;    for (; ((*cp != 0x00) && (*cp != ':')); cp++)      if ((*cp == ',') && (curentry.pw_age == NULL))      {        /* Password age field found */        *cp++ = 0x00;        curentry.pw_age = cp;      }    *cp++ = 0x00;    curentry.pw_uid = atoi(cp);    for (; ((*cp != 0x00) && (*cp != ':')); cp++)      ;    *cp++ = 0x00;    curentry.pw_gid = atoi(cp);    for (; ((*cp != 0x00) && (*cp != ':')); cp++)      ;    *cp++ = 0x00;    curentry.pw_gecos = cp;    curentry.pw_comment = cp;    for (; ((*cp != 0x00) && (*cp != ':')); cp++)      ;    *cp++ = 0x00;    curentry.pw_dir = cp;    for (; ((*cp != 0x00) && (*cp != ':')); cp++)      if (*cp == '\\')	*cp = '/';    *cp++ = 0x00;    curentry.pw_shell = cp;    for (; ((*cp != 0x00) && (*cp != ':') && (*cp != '\n')); cp++)      if (*cp == '\\')	*cp = '/';    *cp = 0x00;    if (curentry.pw_age == NULL)      curentry.pw_age = cp; /* Don't return NULL, return a null string */    return(1);  }  return(0);} /* End of nextent() *//* Old test program removed - Hildo Biersma */#ifdef EXAMPLE/*EXAMPLE PROGRAMDESCRIPTION    Read all lines from the password file and print all users    with password aging info.
