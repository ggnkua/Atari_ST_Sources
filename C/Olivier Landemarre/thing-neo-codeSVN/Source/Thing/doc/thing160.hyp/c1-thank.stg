I'd like to thank some people without whose assistance, suggestions, 
support etc. the implementation of Thing would not have turned out so 
nicely (in alphabetical order):

  @{U}Thomas Binder@{u}
    ForTOS2GEM and his helpful tips and suggestions with MiNT and MinixFS 
    and ongoing Thing development beyond v1.0.

  @{U}Stefan Brusch@{u}
    For his outstanding UUCP software, without which the combined beta
    testing effort over the Internet would have been a lot more hassle!

  @{U}Volker BurggrÑf@{u}
    For his assistance 'transferring' files between Augsburg and Oldenburg 
    and beta testing.
 
  @{U}@Joe Connor - InterActive@{u}
    For this English translation and support for English Thing users via 
    InterActive.

  @{U}Thomas KÅnneth@{u}
    For making available the XIMG loading routines for displaying coloured 
    background images

  @{U}Erik Meltzer@{u}
    For the production of a TeX handbook and helpful TeX & LaTeX tips.
 
  @{U}Hartwig zur Nieden@{u}
    For his helpful information about the AV Protocol and the excellent 
    file search tool ParaFin which works outstandingly well with Thing.

  @{U}Thomas Schulze@{u}
    For the MiNT/MultiTOS documentation in @{"ST-Guide" LINK "ST-GUIDE.HYP"} format and the 
    'Dcheneva' fonts for Thing.

  @{U}Holger Weets@{u}
    For his genial @{"ST-Guide" LINK "ST-GUIDE.HYP"} hypertext system and PacShell which since
    v2.58 supports the AV Protocol and Drag&Drop allowing it to work 
    superbly together with Thing.
 
    Holger is also one of those 'pernickety' beta testers with a natural 
    instinct to find new bugs and remember all the things I 'forget'!

I'd also like to thank all the other beta testers and every registered 
user, happily already too numerous to mention by name, for your patience, 
suggestions and the faith you have expressed in my work!


@{B}By Thomas Binder:@{b}

I too would naturally like to thank a number of people who are or were 
helping me to drive further development of Thing forward (like Arno also 
in alphabetical order):

  @{U}Arno Welzel@{u}
    Most especially for Thing and his trust in transferring further 
    development of Thing to me.

  @{U}Mario Becroft@{u}
    For his parameters substitution function, which has at last made it 
    into Thing.

  @{U}Joe Connor - InterActive@{u}
    For continuing the translation into English and the support for the
    shareware version of Thing provided in England and other countries.

  @{U}Jens Hiescher@{u}
    For the MultiTOS-compatible operating system N.AES for MiNT.

  @{U}Dirk Klemmt@{u}
    For the new 3D-look and his help, specially at the ATARI-Messe 1997 
    and for the optimistion of the Thing code.

  @{U}J.Kock@{u}
     For undertaking the registration process in Sweden.

  @{U}Thomas KÅnneth@{u}
    For the XIMG loading module ThingImg.

  @{U}Andreas Kromke@{u}
    For MagiC and his comments in Atari.Soft, where I often don't know 
    whether I should just laugh or really get annoyed ...

  @{U}Rainer Mannigel@{u}
    For the continued development of N.AES.

  @{U}Milan Computersysteme GbR@{u}
     (and naturally also all others participating directly or indirectly 
     in developing the Milan computer) for the Milan, and for the decision 
     to use Thing (even if under the name Ming, which you can blame me for) 
     as the desktop for the computer.

  @{U}Peter West (TransAction)@{u}
    For the translation of ThingIcn 1.10 and Thing 1.2x into English (based 
    on work by Joe Connor for previous versions).

  @{U}Woller Systeme@{u}
    For the continued commercial distribution of N.AES


@{B}By Olivier Landemarre:@{b}

I would like to thank all the people originally involved in this project
and those who helped me restart the development of the Thing.

The release of the Thing desktop as open source was a gift to the Atari
community of a highly appreciated software that apart setting a 'graphic
shell' standard for the platform, was of inspiration for other projects.

  @{U}Arno Welzel@{u}
   For creating Thing, likely the best free desktop available on the 
   TOS platform. By releasing it as FreeWare and open source, allowed 
   new developers to further improve the code and add new features to 
   the benefit of all the users.
   
  @{U}Thomas Binder@{u}
   For the development of Thing beyond v1.0 and for distributing several
   shareware versions all well received by the Atari ST community. 

  @{U}Atari Computer Project Team@{u}
   The driving role of the ACP Team for the release of Thing as freeware 
   and the preservation of the source code was fundamental. Without they 
   committment the Thing desktop sources might have been lost.

  @{U}Dirk Klemmt@{u}
    For further development within the framework of the ACP initiative.
  
  @{U}Gerhard Stroll@{u}
    For further development within the framework of the ACP initiative.
    His work in merging the various versions of the code was fundamental
    for the restart of project.
    
  @{U}Mikro@{u}
    For the preservation of the Thing source code at GitHub, after the
    demise of the atariforge repository.
    
  @{U}Ldv@{u}
    For updating the RSCs files, the thing.hyp guide, for creating the 
    new 256 colours icon sets 'Thing Neo' with their fresh and modern 
    look and for beta testing.
