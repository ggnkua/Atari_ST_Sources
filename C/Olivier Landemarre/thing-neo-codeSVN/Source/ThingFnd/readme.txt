Important notes for the (second) ThingFnd-beta 0.10 dated 99/06/24:

This is an INOFFICIAL BETAVERSION of ThingFnd which may on NO ACCOUNT 
be spread without my explicit permission; if you don't respect that, 
you'll be sentenced to at least 4 hours MS-Windows 95 (or even 98) on a 
486-33 with 8 MB RAM!

Changes:

- Workaround for a problem with N.AES (does send WM_UNTOP when hiding 
  an application, but does not send WM_ONTOP upon un-hiding) that 
  caused the dialog to "freeze"
- Trying to abort a search when "grepping" for a pattern in large files 
  should react more quickly now (though this means a little drop in 
  search speed)
- The item titles in the resulting Thing group now also contain the 
  pathname - shortened in "..."-style, if necessary. Should this be 
  optional?
- Understands three command line options which preselect checkboxes:
  -v: enable "verbose" status display
  -l: follow symbolic links
  -d: also find directories
  -c: filename matching is case sensitive
  As before, when passing folders on the command line, the first one 
  will be used as the search path. Passing drives (e.g. C:\) will 
  create corresponding entries in the drives field.

I couldn't reproduce the problem reported by Mario Becroft that upon 
moving the status window under N.AES, parts of the edit fields (?) 
appear in it. I tried it with and without realtime moving.

Thank you for your attention!
