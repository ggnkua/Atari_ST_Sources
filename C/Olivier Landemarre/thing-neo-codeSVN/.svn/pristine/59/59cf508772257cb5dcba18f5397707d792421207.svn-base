By default the Desktop displays icons for the drives, trash, printer and
clipboard. The desktop can optionally include file, folder and program
icons as desired.

The maximum number of drive icons is 26 (A-Z) with 3 icons for the
trash, printer and clipboard and a further 63 icons available for files,
folders and programs.

The desktop background colour and the fill pattern are set in the 
@{"Desktop Configuration" LINK "%mcf0"} panel accessed via the 'Extra->Configuration'
menu item.

Thing includes a selection of icons for use on the desktop and in the 
directory windows. To save space on the desktop, you can delete the 
whole label of the desktop icons. To do this, select the desired icon 
and choose 'Show Info...' in the 'File' menu.

On the following pages the details of the objects are described.

@image filesys.img 1
      By using the @{"Mount Devices" LINK "%mdrive"} option in the 'Extra' menu, Thing 
      installs @{"icons" LINK "Icons"} for all available drives between A: and Z:. The icon 
      type can be changed by adding "IDRV" entries to the file @{"ICONS.INF" LINK "%DateiformateIC"}.

In the Thing icon manager select the 'Device' option for drive icons.
On the desktop a double-click (or single-click then 'File' >'Open') on
a drive icon opens a new directory window displaying the  contents of 
the selected drive. This can also be done by pressing Alternate together
with the key corresponding to the drive letter.

If icons for any installed GEMDOS drives are not currently displayed 
on the desktop, select 'Extra' > @{"Mount Devices" LINK "%mdrive"} and they will be 
installed automatically.

@image trash.img 1
      The trashcan is always installed on the @{"desktop" LINK "Desktop"} and any objects 
      dragged to the trashcan are deleted. Alternatively objects can 
      be selected then deleted using the 'Edit' > 'Delete...' option or 
via the keyboard shortcut  Shift  +  Delete  (or just  Delete , if the 
option ''Delete' using [Delete] key functions' is selected (crossed) in 
the 'Configuration' > 'System' dialog.
 
The icon type is fixed but the text label can be edited (or removed). To 
do this select (highlight) the trashcan then select 'File' > 'Show Info...' 
to display the 'Info' dialog and press  Esc  to clear the 'Label' editable 
field.

 Icon in ICONS.RSC: "CLIPBOARD"
 AV object type:    VA_OB_CLIPBOARD (3)

@image clipbrd.img 1
      The clipboard is always installed on the desktop and represents the
      GEM clipboard. The icon type is fixed but the text label can be
      edited by selecting the icon then calling the 'Show Info...' option
in the 'File' menu. Objects dragged to the clipboard are copied to the
clipboard path set in 'Info about clipboard' dialog and renamed 'SCRAP'.
The file extender remains unchanged.

Examples: 'README.TXT'   copied to the clipboard is renamed 'SCRAP.TXT'
          'RESOURCE.RSC' copied to the clipboard is renamed 'SCRAP.RSC'
          'PROGRAM.PRG   copied to the clipboard is renamed 'SCRAP.PRG'

Dragging the Clipboard to the trash can deletes all file in the clipboard
path whose names fit the mask 'SCRAP.*'.

If the clipboard path is not set, for example immediately after
installation, Thing looks for the environmental variables 'CLIPBRD' or
'SCRAPDIR' to set the pth. If these variables cannot be found the clipboard
path is set to '\CLIPBRD' in the root of the boot drive.

      calling the 'Show Info' option in the 'File' menu. This icon is used
to pass file/s to the application installed to handle print operations.

      A file may be displayed in a directory window or installed on the
      desktop. Under MiNT and MagiC!3 devices in the directory 'U:\dev\'
      are specially handled.

The filename and attributes for file icons in directory windows may be
edited by selecting the icon then calling 'Show Info...' option in the
'File' menu. The icon text for files installed on the desktop may be edited
(aliased) by selecting the icon then calling the 'Show Info' option in
the 'File' menu.

Thing can open, show or print files where appropriate applications have
been installed to process the file.

      A folder may be displayed in a directory window or installed on the
      desktop.

The folder name for folder icons in directory windows may be edited by
selecting the icon then calling the 'Show Info...' option in the 'File'
menu. The icon text for folders installed on the desktop may be edited
(aliased) by selecting the icon on the desktop then calling 'Show Info...'
option in the 'File' menu.

By default, folders on the desktop or in group windows are opened in
'relative' mode. This means, the 'root' is the folder itself and not the
drive where the folder is located.

@image appl.img 1
      Thing treats every object with the file extension PRG, APP, TOS, TTP
      or ACC as an executable program. The case of the extender is ignored
      so 'APP' and 'app' are considered the same.

Depending on the setting in the 'Setup' dialog, applications with the
extender PRX or ACX are considered the same as PRG or ACC. Optionally you
can use CPX modules (CPX, CPZ, EPX, EPZ) also as programs, if 'Space' from
Christian Grunenberg is installed.

The important difference between file and program icons is that files,
folders and drive objects dragged onto program icons are passed as
parameters to the program. Programs can be installed as applications under
Thing via the 'Applications...' option in the 'Extra' menu.

      Double clicking on a 'parent' icon moves up to the directory tree to
      display the parent directory. The 'parent' icon isn't a real object
      but is useful to have around. It provides a quick way to move/copy
objects to the 'parent' directory without opening another window. Unlike
real folders 'parent' icons cannot be moved, they're ignored during
move/copy operations even if selected.

      MiNT (and MagiC Mac) may include BIOS devices in the 'U:\dev\'

      files to the device via Drag&drop.

      Only use this option if you know what you're doing!

      files to 'ikbd'!

@image group.img 1
        Object groups are actually just 'normal' ASCII text files with the 
        GRP file extender which, like files, can be accommodated in 
        directories as well as on the desktop and other object groups.
These list the path and filename of the original objects contained in the 
group along with an optional alias name.

However such @{"group files" LINK "%DateiformateGRP"} are handled by Thing in a special way: If a group 
file is opened, Thing opens a 'group window' containing aliases to the 
'real' objects. Copy, Move and Delete operations can be performed on 
aliases just like on normal objects but the original objects remain 
unaffected.

If you have to continue using Kobold 2, change the 
line 'OKBD 0' to 'OKBD 1' in THING.INF with a text
editor (or insert it if it's not present).
Thing will then (hopefully) use Kobold-2 compatible
jobs. This setting isn't lost on saving THING.INF.

If, due to the lack of a suitable icon editor, you want
to edit the icons using 'IconCons' from the Ease desktop, 
rename the icon to _CLIPBRD, because the program only 
supports a maximum of eight characters for labels. Thing 
looks for _CLIPBRD if CLIPBOARD is not available.

Symbolic links are usually called 'aliases'

the influence of the MacOS since MagiC Mac),
though they have little or nothing in common

instance.

@pnode "%arno"
Unfortunately it would appear also that this had led to 
Arno not reacting at all to moneys sent to him in error,
so that he neither passes on the money to me nor informs 
the sender about his mistake.

As I can't keep on chasing missing resgitrations and Arno 
resists all reproaches, I want to point out clearly here 
that from now on I will no longer do anything about this 
but insist on correct (repeat) transfer of the money due.
