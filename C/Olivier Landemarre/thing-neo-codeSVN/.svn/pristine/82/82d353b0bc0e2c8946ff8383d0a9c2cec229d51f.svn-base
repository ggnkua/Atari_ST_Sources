Object groups                                                         Thing

Object groups help avoid the chaos which results if all the frequently 
used files, folders and programs are placed directly on the @{"desktop" LINK "%DesktopA"}.
Furthermore the desktop is frequently covered by some windows and so not 
directly accessible.

A Thing object group contains 'alias' objects, each of which represent 
a 'real' object. This provides a convenient way to group frequently 
used objects (files, folders and programs) together in a 'themed' group 
window irrespective of the location of the original objects and without 
the clutter of ancillary objects.

For example, a 'Comms' group could contain a terminal program, archive 
manager, upload directory and BBS filelist without the usual clutter of 
other folders, text, resource and configuration files!

New objects can be added to group windows via Drag&Drop from other Thing 
or group windows and re-ordered as desired. Holding down the  Control  key 
during a Drag&Drop operation moves the alias object instead of copying it 
(analogous to normal Copy/Move operations).

As with directory windows, group objects are positioned automatically and 
can be displayed as icons or text.

Each object group is saved as an individual group file with a '.GRP' 
extender together with the following information:

  ù Descriptive title
  ù Position and size
  ù Display mode (icons or text)
  ù Font for text mode

The contents of the group window are saved using a similar format to
the other Thing configuration files:

  ù Blank lines and lines with a leading '#' are ignored
  ù Every valid entry includes a 4 character token at the line start


      Thing from version 1.20 on supports a number of new group options 
      with which the format has been extended. After opening an old group 
      file, therefore, there will be an indication that the group has been 
      altered. If one now saves it (which will be done automatically if 
      the corresponding option has been set), the group file will be 
      extended automatically, though in such a way that it can continue 
      to be used without problems by older Thing versions.
