Thing recognises certain programs as executable. Optionally other files 
can be treated as executable according to the options set in the 
'Configuration' > 'System' dialog.

  @{U}GEM Programs@{u}

    All files with the following extenders:
    PRG, APP, GTP and (optionally) PRX, APX.

    GEM Programs can either be started normally or via a VA_START 
    command line under a multitasking environment.

    Programs with the GTP extender will request input on a command line if 
    the program is started without parameters (e.g. without Drag&Drop of 
    files to the program icon).

  @{0U}Desk Accessories@{0}

    All files with the ACC and (optionally) ACX extender.
    
    Under Thing desk accessories are only 'awakened' with VA_START or 
    (optionally) AC_OPEN. If an accessory isn't active as yet it will be 
    treated as a normal GEM program; a safety alert is displayed 
    (optionally) to remind you not all accessories can tolerate being 
    launched as programs.
 
    Under OSs that permit subsequent installation of desk accessories 
    (e.g. MagiC from Version 4 up and N.AES) a non-active accessory will 
    be installed as such and called.
	
  @{0U}TOS Programs@{0}

    All files with the TOS or TTP file extender. Under MiNT even files 
    without a special extender but with the 'x' flag set are treated as 
    TTPs.

    Output from TOS programs will be displayed in the @{"Console window" LINK "%EinfhrungCON"}
    installed on your system, TOSWIN2 (MyAES, XaAES and N.AES 2), tw100 
    (N.AES 1.x), MINIWIN (MultiTOS), VT52 (Magic), MINIWIN (MultiTOS) or
    TOS2GEM (generally included in Thing archives). 
    
    In contrast to GEM programs no parameter passing via VA_START is 
    possible. TTP/GTP programs display a parameter dialog as required.

  @{0U}CPX Module (optional)@{0}

    If Freedom 2 or the 'alternative control panel' Space by Christian 
    Grunenberg is installed it's possible to run programs with the CPX, 
    EPX and (optionally) CPZ and EPZ extenders as normal GEM programs.

    The crucial difference Freedom 2 and Space offer is the ability to 
    run CPX modules in @{0I}parallel@{0} to Thing even under Single-TOS!

Programs can be started either by a double-click on the program file 
(or single-click and 'File' > 'Open...') and via Drag&Drop where a file 
is dragged onto a program icon.

The real advantage of a desktop is the ability to link file extender/s 
with specific applications, so that a double-click on a file launches 
a program capable of handling it. For example double-clicking on an image 
could launch a graphics application that automatically loads the image. 
In Thing, this process is described as 'Opening'.

Thing offers additional 'Show' and 'Print' functions, for which given 
programs can be installed as well. In Thing there is no such thing as 
'the viewing program' or 'the printing program'; one can specify exactly 
which programs are to be used to Show or Print given file-types.
 
Allowing more than one application to be installed for each file-type 
opens up some useful possibilities. For example a DVI driver could be 
installed to Print and Show all DVI files, with IdeaList installed to 
Print all remaining files.

If a file is opened with a double-click, Thing first checks to see whether 
there is an application installed for opening this file-type. If there is, 
then it will be started with the file passed as an argument. If not, a 
check is now made to see if there is an application with which the file 
can be shown. It there is one, it will be started. If Thing cannot find 
any appropriate application, it will bring up a corresponding alert. 
Search for a suitable application is dispensed with, of course, if the 
double-clicked file is executable.

If either of the two checks finds more than one suitable application, a 
dialog appears for selecting the one required.

If, however, one opens a file with  Control  + double-click, Thing will 
only look for an application with which one can Show the file. This 
permits one to take a quick look at a resource file, for instance, without 
having to call up Interface or ResourceMaster first.

With a universal viewer that can show virtually anything (e.g. Look'n See) 
one must enter '*' in the 'Show' list, @{0I}not@{0} the 'Open' list, as otherwise
all executable programs will also be passed to the viewer!

Each application can be individually assigned certain properties, 
including:

  @{0U}Which file-types is a program installed for?@{0}

    Here one or more file-types, including wildcards, can be entered for 
    each of the functions 'Open', 'Show' and 'Print'.
    For example a text editor may have the entry 'txt,*.doc' for the 
    'Open' function or '*' for the 'Show' function as the default viewer.
 
    Always remember that Thing uses 'real' wildcards! So '*.*' does not 
    have the same effect as '*'!  @{"Further details" LINK "%mmask" 20}.

  @{0U}Type of program (dependent on filename)@{0}

    This determines how the program is run.

  @{0U}An unambiguous title@{0}

    If no title is specified then the program's filename is used by 
    default. But you can also assign any of your own titles which will 
    then appear in the list of all installed applications, and this is
    automatically used as a label for desktop or group icons if the 
    program is placed on the desktop from a directory window.
    Any combination of upper and lower case text up to 32 characters in 
    length can be used.

  @{0U}Shortcut (optional)@{0}

    In contrast to files and folders, programs can also make use of
     Alternate  shortcuts which not only launch the program but 
    (optionally) pass all selected objects as a command line.

  @{0U}Start directory@{0}

    Normally a program considers its own directory as the start directory. 
    Sometimes it's more useful if the directory passed in the command line 
    is considered the start directory, or alternatively the topped 
    directory window. Thing offers all three options.

Many other options are provided, which means you can customise Thing to 
your exact requirements.

Besides the actually installed applications, Thing also uses a 'default 
application' that regulates the procedure to be used with uninstalled 
programs. Here, naturally, only very few properties can be changed (thus 
there is no point in assigning file-types, for instance). Some of the
non-selectable options of the default application can be set also in 
@{"'Extra' > 'Configuration...'" LINK "%mconf"}.

@line 1 75 0 0 7
@autorefon

If you've used the Gemini replacement desktop, you will know the advantages 
of its integrated 'Mupfel' shell:

 1. The shell doesn't have to be loaded specially and is always available.
 
 2. @{"Objects" LINK "%DesktopO"} can be dragged to Mupfel scripts, making them available as 
    command line parameters.
 
 3. Mupfel scripts can be assigned to an application to open certain 
    file-types.

In Thing, every shell must be started as a program after loading. This 
may initially seem to be a disadvantage but it is more flexible because 
you can choose any shell you like -- so you are not dependent on my 
programming skills ;-)
 
Even when started as a program it's still possible to drag objects to 
scripts or to install scripts as an application! This is described below:

@{0U}Installing a shell@{0}

First of all Thing has to be told which application is responsible for 
dealing with the script. Install the shell program of your choice in the 
'Extra' -> 'Applications...' dialog under the 'General' tab and enter the 
script file-type (e.g '*.mup') in the 'Is used to Open:' field under the 
'Files' tab. So that one may also drag objects to the scripts, the 'Use
Drag&Drop' option must be set (crossed).

@{0U}Drag&Drop@{0}

In this connection Drag&Drop means that any script can have a file, folder 
or program dragged to it which will be passed to the shell along with 
the name of the script as command line parameters. For example:

If the file 'F:\INCOMING\ALICE.LZH' is Drag&Dropped to the script 
'D:\TOOLS\UNPACK.MUP' the following command line would be generated:

  'D:\TOOLS\UNPACK.MUP F:\INCOMING\ALICE.LZH'

Internally the script only uses the second parameter:
'F:\INCOMING\ALICE.LZH'

@{0U}Installing a script as an application@{0}

Once a shell is installed then naturally scripts for the shell can be 
installed as applications -- just like in Gemini ;-).

The start directory, default parameters, options and environment are at 
present taken from the corresponding installed application -- although 
this may change in a future Thing release.

You're not restricted a single shell! For example it is perfectly possible 
to install Mupfel, MCMD and GAWK simultaneously and so use *.mup, *.bat 
and *.awk files as programs!
