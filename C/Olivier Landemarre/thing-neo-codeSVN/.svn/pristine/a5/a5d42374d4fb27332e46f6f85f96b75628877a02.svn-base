Introduction, Note by the project coordinator                         Thing

Thank you for installing Thing 1.60 'Thing Neo'. The development of this
new release of the Thing desktop took one year of coding and testing
of a software that in the 90th of the last century gained a widespread 
popularity among the Atari ST community and still today has a large base
of loyal users. 

This new version of Thing, is based on the 'Gerhard branch' available at
GitHub. Altough my original plan was to perform just a quick 'clean up' 
of the source code to be able to compile Thing in Pure C and GCC without 
the need of old or unsupported libraries, the project soon turned into 
a major overhaul of Thing to fix bugs, overcome old limitations and 
add new features.

As you might imagine, it was a challenging experience to jump into a 
program who was officially distributed the last time more than 20 years
ago, and that was originally coded the 'old way' without the help of 
today developer platforms thus without a clear track of what was changed
and why.

I would like also to warmly thank all the coders who helped the transition
of the Thing sources to the new millennium by merging and clean up the 
various sources available at the time it was released as 'open source' 
more than 10 years ago, added experimental new features, and granted its 
preservation on online platforms for software development. Their work was
fundamental for a quick and (almost) smooth restart of the development
of this famed desktop.

Altough this new version of Thing was extensively tested and proven stable
in a normal day-by-day usage on several up-to-date FreeMiNT platforms 
(also in protected mode), there is no guarantee it will run flawless on 
all FreeMiNT configurations or other TOS based operating systems.

@{B}DISCLAIMER@{b}
USE THIS SOFTWARE AND THE INCLUDED DOCUMENTATION AT YOUR OWN RISK, 
NO GUARANTEE IS GIVEN.

DUE TO INCREASED HW REQUIREMENTS, LEGACY M68000 CPUS ARE NOT SUPPORTED.

The first german version of the Thing desktop was released by Arno Welzel
in december 1994. Since then, many additional features and improvements
where introduced often on users request. The big number of registered
users and articles in 'ST-Computer', 'Atari World' and 'ST Format' 
motivated Arno Welzel to continue the development of Thing ;-)

In 1996, Thomas Binder took over the development of Thing, releasing 
four additional versions, up to the most popular Thing 1.27.   

Thanks to Interactive UK, a full English translation was soon available. 

Thing at that time was still shareware, and a registration key was needed
to unlock all the features of the full version. However, unregistered 
copies could already run with minimal limitations.

Version 1.27, published in 1998, was the last "official" shareware version
distributed by the orginal authors. altough a few later builds (v.1.29 
and v.1.30) were sent to testers and a few users.

In 2012 the Thing desktop was released as FreeWare - Open source under a 
GNU LGPL3 licence. This release was sponsored and supported by the ACP 
initiative, as the Thing Authors were involved in the development of the
FireBee computer from its early days. The authors agreed not only to 
freeing the binary but also to release Thing as open source. 

A public key and registration details valid for Thing versions 1.27 and 
1.29 were published at the Atari Computer Project (ACP) web page (now 
firebee.org). In addition, at Arno's Thing web page on GitHub, are 
available the archive and a public key of version 1.09.

Since 2012, registered copies of the Thing desktop versions 1.27 and 1.29
were included in the FreeMiNT distributions for the FireBee computer.

After Thing was released as open source, a few developers merged all 
sources available at that time (versions 1.27, 1.27b, 1.29 and 1.30) to 
produce a free version of the desktop. 

Their work brought to the (unreleased) version 1.50(beta) that, among
others new features and fixes, introduced multi language support.

The full source code, initially hosted at the ACP CVS repository on
Atariforge, it is now preserved on GitHub.

In 2023, Olivier Landemarre created on Sourceforge his own branch to
further develop the Thing desktop. His work led to the release of the 
new version 1.60 of Thing, codenamed 'Thing Neo'. 

Oliver main goal was to give to the Thing desktop a 'fresh up' and to
improve Thing integration on 'high-end' FreeMiNT based platforms.
 
Thing is now compiled for a 68020 CPU and will run on all TOS/EMUTOS
platforms equipped with a 68020->68080 CPU. 

Due to higher system requirements, Thing 1.60 is not compatible with
legacy 68000 Atari ST computers.

Version 1.60 is the first official distribution of this desktop since
the release of Thing 1.27.


@autorefoff
@{U}Summary of new/improved features and changes in Thing 1.60@{u}: 

- Thing is now compiled for a 68020 CPU. Legacy M68000 CPU are not 
  supported;     
- runs on all TOS/EmuTOS computers (Atari or Clones) with a 68020->68080
  CPU and on the FireBee (FireTOS only). Does not run in Coldfire native
  mode;
- legacy 68000 Atari ST computer are not supported due to the increased
  HW/OS requirements;
- removed dependancies from old and unsupported libraries;
- Improved multilanguage support (introduced in Thing 1.50). At start
  Thing loads localized RSCs according to the language set in NVRAM or
  in the AES;
- General and desktop configuration files are always saved in the HOME 
  directory. If no HOME is defined, they are saved inside THINGDIR.
  If no HOME nor THINGDIR exist, config files are saved locally inside 
  the CONFIG folder.
- The THINGDIR environment variable is only used for configuration 
  files (except ICONS.INF always handled locally).
- The THINGDIR environment variable no longer override HOME.
- icons are handled via the AES, can have any size and up to 
  256 colors;
- Four indipendent icon sets are available: BIG, SMALL, B&W and COLORTOS.
  The appropriate icon set is loaded by Thing according to the AES  
  capabilities and the selected video mode;
- The ICONS.INF files are always handled locally.  
- Two new 256 colors (NVDI palette) icon sets (SMALL/BIG) are available
  to improve user experience on high-end platforms. The sets have a size
  of 48 pts (SMALL SET) and up to 64 pts (BIG SET). The AES must support
  icons up to 64 pts and 256 colors.
  The BIG set is automatically loaded above 1000p of screen height, the
  SMALL set on smaller screen resolution.
- B&W or COLORTOS 'legacy' icon sets are automatically loaded when the 
  AES doesn't support the BIG/SMALL sets (Atari TOS4, FireTOS and EmuTOS);
- Windows' objects handling required a major overhaul. Previously
  Thing was hanging while trying to display the contents of drives/folders
  with large numbers of objects. 
- Symlinks of normal icons are marked with a green check symbol. Broken 
  symlinks are marked with a red crossed symbol;  
- Long file names up to 127 characters are supported;
- Paths up to 512 characters are supported;
- SDMASTER environment variable supported in MyAES, XaAES, N.AES and MagiC;
- In a MyAES environment, Thing may load desktop wallpapers via the AES;    
- Lots of minor improvements and bug fixes.

@{B}An overview of the features of the Thing desktop:@{b}

 ù Multilanguage support. At start, Thing automatically loads a localized
   RSC for the language configured in NVRAM or the AES. If no localized
   RSC is found, Thing defaults to English.
   
 ù Context sensitive help with ST-Guide: You can get help by pressing the
@box 4 6 1
    Help -key. In a multitasking environment, ST-Guide can be used as an
   external program too.

 ù Full support of alternate file systems: Thing supports long file names
   up to 128 characters length.

 ù Support of TOSWIN2 under MiNT - It is possible to run TOS/TTP programs
   in parallel to the desktop.

 ù Console Window using TOSWIN2 or TOS2GEM.

 ù Kobold support: Kobold 2 can be used for copying/moving/deleting files
   and formatting disks. You can use Kobold as an accessory or as an
   external program. You can specify the minimum number of files or the
   amount of data for Kobold usage.

 ù XIMG-files can be used as background pictures for the desktop. Images
   are loaded with a THINGIMG.OVL. If MyAES is installed, pictures (PNG 
   and JPG formats) may be loaded without OVL module. 

 ù Full GDOS support: Proportional fonts (TrueType and Speedo) can be 
   used for directory windows.

 ù Full AV protocol: Most of the tools, which where designed for use
   with Gemini can be used with Thing too (e.g. ParaFin, PacShell or
   TreeView).

 ù Font protocol from Christian Grunenberg: Thing can be used as a
   'font selector' -- 'active' by using the FONT_SELECT-message or
   via 'Drag&Drop' (Thing sends FONT_CHANGED to the owner of the window).

 ù Drag&Drop protocol with FreeMiNT, MagiC or MultiTOS.

 ù 'Modern' dialog boxes in windows, non-modal and with keyboard-shortcuts.
   'Tabs', 'Drop-Down-Listboxes' and 3D-buttons are also implemented.

 ù Icons in a normal GEM resource file. Colour icons (up to 256 colours) 
   and 'animated' icons are supported as well. Sice version 1.60, the 
   icons are handled via the AES. Icons greater than 32 pts and in colour 
   will be available only if supported by the AES. 

 ù 'Object groups' to hold several files, folders and programs in common
   windows -- similar to a 'desktop in a window'.

The dialog boxes of Thing offer some additional features compared to the
standard GEM dialog boxes:

 ù All entries can also be handled with the keyboard (keyboard shortcuts).
@box 52 11 1
   Just press the underlined character holding the  Alternate -key.

@box 19 8 1
@box 43 4 1
@box 60 6 1
 ù In addition to  Return  for the button  OK  you can use  Undo  as a
@box 17 8 1
   shortcut for  Cancel .

 ù Dialog boxes and alert boxes(!) are display in windows and offer a
@box 36 6 1
   context sensitive help with the  Help -key.

 ù Configurable '3D buttons' also in monochrome screen modes.

 ù Many dialog boxes are 'non-modal' - this means you can use all other
   functions of Thing even when the dialog box is opened. Closing such a
@box 50 8 1
   dialog box window is the same as clicking the  Cancel  button.
@autorefoff
 ù Drag&Drop: You can put file names to entrie fields of some dialog boxes
   by dragging them from the desktop or a window to the dialog box. If
   you want to add the file names to the current contents of the field,
@box 21 11 1
@box 36 9 1
   you have to hold  Alternate  or  Control  while dragging the files.

 ù All popup menus or listboxes can be handled using the cursor keys and
@box 4 8 1
@box 13 7 1
@box 24 5 1
@box 30 6 1
    Return / Enter  or  Esc / Undo .

@box 9 8 1
@box 21 7 1
@box 29 8 1
 ù With  Insert  or  Shift + Insert  you can open a popup menu to enter
   special characters at the current position of the cursor in a editable
   field.

 ù Support of the GEM clipboard:
@box 7 9 1
@box 17 3 1
    -  Control + C  (copy) copies the contents of the current editable
       field to the GEM clipboard.
@box 7 9 1
@box 17 3 1
    -  Control + V  (paste) puts the contents of the GEM clipboards to the
       current editable field.
@box 7 9 1
@box 17 3 1
    -  Control + X  (Cut) copies the contents of the current editable
       field to the GEM clipboard and clears the field.

 ù In some dialog boxes you can enter files by double-clicking the
   editable fields. A file selector appears and allows you to select
   the desired files.

 ù 'Drop-Down-Listboxes'

@limage poplist.img 4

   These listboxes are the combination of a popup object and a listbox.
   All entries can be selected in the same way as in a popup menu. But
   there is a slider too, if required.

 ù 'Tabs'

@limage tbutton.img 4

   Some dialog boxes contain multiple 'pages', which can be selected by
   clicking the 'tabs' at the top border. The example above shows the
   'Setup' dialog box, displaying the page 'Windows'.

Introduction, Auto Locator                                            Thing
@line 1 75 0 0 7

@autorefoff
Finding individual objects in directory windows containing hundreds of
files and folders can be tedious. Thing offers an 'auto locator' to
make this task easier. Using the auto locator the active window can be
'masked', automatically selecting matching object/s.

Pressing a valid key ('*' or the first letter of any object) begins
adding a mask to window info line and dynamically selects or deslects
any matching object/s as the mask is edited.

The 'Configuration' dialog in the 'Extra' menu offers an 'Autolocator
with filename completion' option in the panel @{"Window 1" link %mcf1} which constantly
strives to isolate a single object and will automatically add characters
to the mask to achieve this. When this option is active (crossed) the
@box 1 11 1
 Backspace -key clears the active mask from the window info line and
deselects all objects. Here's some examples using this directory
listing:

..    DOC   THING   TOS2GEM   README.ENG   README.TXT   REGISTER.TXT

'*'   Adds [**] to the window info line and select all the objects.
'R'   Selects: README.ENG, README.TXT and REGISTER.TXT
      The mask displayed in the window info line depends on the
      'Autolocator with filename completion' option:
      [RE] auto locator on (crossed)
      [R] auto locator off (uncrossed)
'REG' Selects: REGISTER.TXT
      [REGISTER.TXT] auto locator on
      [REG] auto locator off
'*.'  Adds [*.*] to the window info line ready to select objects by
      extender.
'*.E' Selects: README.ENG
      [*.ENG] auto locator on
      [*.E*] auto locator off
'*.T' Selects: README.TXT and REGISTER.TXT
      [*.TXT*] auto locator on
      [*.T*] auto locator off

@box 5 7 1
The  Space -key can be used to remove the trailing '*' which is useful
to select objects without extensions (typically folders). For example:

'*. ' Selects: DOC, THING and TOS2GEM

The mask displayed in the window info line is [*.] whether the auto
locator is on or off. An alternative selection method is provided using
the @{"cursor" link %EinfhrungCRSR}.

@line 1 75 0 0 7
@autorefon

@box 11 8 1
Press the  Insert -key to toggle cursor mode between on and off. An
object is selected (usually the parent icon) and the cursor, denoted by
a flashing, dotted outline is drawn around the object.

Using the cursor keys it's possible to navigate around the window which
scrolls so the selected object always remains visible. This method is
ideal for selecting a single object.

If you want to use the cursor to select more than one object, you
@box 44 7 1
can move the cursor while holding down the  Shift -key. Another
way is to switch of the setup option 'Cursor with automatic selection'.
@box 49 7 1

In this case you can select objects by pressing  Shift + Insert  or by

As Thing displays directories, @{"object groups" LINK "Object groups"} etc. in windows, 
the following operating system specific features are supported:

  @{U}Iconify@{u}
    MultiTOS (only with AES 4.1, which was never released officially), 
    MyAES, N.AES, XaAES etc., non-modal dialogs, directories and object groups
@box 25 3 1 0
    have an 'Iconifier'    icon available that, when clicked on, reduces 
    the window to the size of an icon. A double-click on the iconified 
    window restores the original size. The shape of the iconifier icon may
    vary according to the AES in use. 

  @{U}Send to background ('Backdrop')@{u}
    Under MagiC/MTOS/N.AES or with WINX installed windows can be 
    'bottomed' i.e sent to the background. To do this click on the window 
@box 53 3 1 0
    title bar or, under MagiC, click the 'Backdrop'    button.

  @{U}Hot Closer@{u}
    Under MagiC there's a so called 'HotCloser' which makes it possible 
    to jump higher up the directory tree by holding down the mouse button
    without going through the intermediate stages.The mouse pointer
@box 38 4 1 0
@image "img248.img" 39
    changes shape to a curved arrow.
@remark 16x14x2

    If you do not like this behaviour of windows under MagiC you can switch

@line 1 75 0 0 7

@{B}The TosWin2 console@{b}
FreeMiNT distributions with either the MyAES, XaAES or N.AES AESs, use 
different console windows. For the default console in MyAES, XaAES and
N.AES2, you may see: @{"The TosWin2 console" LINK "TOSWIN2"}.


@{B}The TOS2GEM console@{b}
The utility TOS2GEM, programmed by Thomas Binder, was the default console
for the Thing desktop. It offers a clean and simple scrolling window to 
displays the output from TOS/TTP programs. In latest FreeMiNT distributions
with MyAES, XaAES or N.AES, it was superseed by TosWin2. 

TOS2GEM is only reserved if the window is open. Otherwise other programs 
may also use TOS2GEM for their own needs.

Under a multitasking environment it's important to note that every other 
application, including Thing itself, is blocked when the Console window 
is in operation.

TOS programs do not run in parallel with thing, when started in the Thing
console window.

In order to run TOS/TTP programs in parallel with regular GEM applications
various tools are supplied with FreeMiNT, MagiC or MultiTOS (TosWin2, VT52,
MINIWIN). These are automatically started by the operating system so long
as a TOS/TTP program has not been started in the Thing console window.
@autorefon


@{U}Terminal size@{u}
If the environmental variables LINES and COLUMNS are set, Thing sets
the terminal size to the specified values. Otherwise, the terminal inside
the console window will be 25 lines and 80 coloumns.

@autorefoff
@{U}History@{u}
If you want to see long outputs of program (e.g. compiler etc.) after
leaving the program, you can specify a 'history buffer' up to 9999 lines.
The beginning of this buffer is marked with a horizontal line.
You can change the size of the history buffer in the page 'TOS2GEM' of
the 'Setup' dialog.

If you do not need a history buffer, you should set the history to 0 lines
to save memory.

Thing optionally allows Kobold to take over copy, move and delete
operations. Kobold may be installed as either a desktop accessory or
run as a program.

If Kobold is installed as an accessory or running in parallel under a
suitable multitasking system Thing generates a memory job, no Kobold
jobfile is required, and Kobold displays only its status dialog.

If Kobold is called as a program under singletasking systems, a Kobold
jobfile is generated and Kobold is loaded.

By default the jobfile, THING.KBJ, is located in the Thing directory.
The name and access path is entered in the Setup dialog from the
'Setup...' option in the 'Extra' menu. For example the job could be
generated in a RAM disk.

@box 1 75 6

      Support for Kobold in Thing is based on version 2.5 of Kobold. It's
