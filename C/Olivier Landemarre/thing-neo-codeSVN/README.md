Originally created by Arno Welzel.

Thanks to Thomas Binder and the many others who contributed to this project.

Thing is free software. 

# Thing-neo

It is my effort to simplify and stabilize Gerhard Thing branch with this goals:

 - Let AES load ressource file and display color icons (so need minimum AES 4 to run, should work fine under NAES, XaAES, Magic and MyAES)  
 - Remove maximum of exotic library use to build Thing under PureC compiler like remove use of Mintlib not stable, now it use standard PureC lib except PCTOSLIB.LIB replaced by Philipp Donzé TOS.LIB (see https://donzé.ch/atari/software/toslib/)
 - Fix know issue that was forever present (like crash with too long file name)
 - Creation of 2 new color icon set by Lodovico Zanier
 - Add some new features around color icons (choose set of icons.rsc file linke to screen size, 256 color work in TC), and choose of RSC files by language
