/* Declarations.  All references to names are represented as ..._DECL nodes.
   The decls in one binding context are chained through the TREE_CHAIN field.
   Each DECL has a DECL_NAME field which contains an IDENTIFIER_NODE.
    (Some decls, most often labels, may have zero as the DECL_NAME).
   DECL_CONTEXT points to the node representing the context in which
    this declaration has its scope.  For FIELD_DECLs, this is the
    RECORD_TYPE or UNION_TYPE node that the field belongs to;
    for other kinds of decl nodes, this is a LET_STMT node or the ROOT_NODE.
   The TREE_TYPE field holds the data type of the object, when relevant.
    LABEL_DECLs have no data type.  For TYPE_DECL, the TREE_TYPE field
    contents are the type whose name is being declared.
   The DECL_ALIGN, DECL_SIZE, DECL_SIZE_UNIT
    and DECL_MODE fields exist in decl nodes just as in type nodes.
    They are unused in LABEL_DECL, TYPE_DECL and CONST_DECL nodes.

   DECL_OFFSET holds an integer number of bits offset for the location.
   DECL_VOFFSET holds an expression for a variable offset; it is
   to be multiplied by DECL_VOFFSET_UNIT (an integer).
   These fields are relevant only in FIELD_DECLs and PARM_DECLs.

   DECL_INITIAL holds the value to initialize a variable to,
   or the value of a constant.  For a function, it holds the body
   (a node of type LET_STMT representing the function's binding contour
   and whose body contains the function's statements.)

   PARM_DECLs use a special field:
   DECL_ARG_TYPE is the type in which the argument is actually
    passed, which may be different from its type within the function.

   FUNCTION_DECLs use four special fields:
   DECL_ARGUMENTS holds a chain of PARM_DECL nodes for the arguments.
   DECL_RESULT holds a RESULT_DECL node for the value of a function,
    or it is 0 for a function that returns no value.
    (C functions returning void have zero here.)
   DECL_FUNCTION_CODE is a code number that is nonzero for
    built-in functions.  Its value is an enum built_in_function
    that says which built-in function it is.
   DECL_BLOCK_SYMTAB_ADDRESS records (after the symtab data for the function's
    body has been output) the address in the symtab file of the
    `struct block' for the function's top-level binding context.
    This must be stored in the symtab structure for the function name.
   Also, TREE_UNSIGNED (function_decl) is nonzero if the ({...})
    construct is used in the function.

   DECL_SOURCE_FILE holds a filename string and DECL_SOURCE_LINE
   holds a line number.  */
