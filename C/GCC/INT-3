Passes and Files of the Compiler
********************************

The overall control structure of the compiler is in `toplev.c'.  This file
is responsible for initialization, decoding arguments, opening and closing
files, and sequencing the passes.

The parsing pass is invoked only once, to parse the entire input.  The RTL
intermediate code for a function is generated as the function is parsed, a
statement at a time.  Each statement is read in as a syntax tree and then
converted to RTL; then the storage for the tree for the statement is
reclaimed.  Storage for types (and the expressions for their sizes),
declarations, and a representation of the binding contours and how they
nest, remains until the function is finished being compiled; these are all
needed to output the debugging information.

Each time the parsing pass reads a complete function definition or
top-level declaration, it calls the function `rest_of_compilation' or
`rest_of_decl_compilation' in `toplev.c', which are responsible for all
further processing necessary, ending with output of the assembler language.
 All other compiler passes run, in sequence, within `rest_of_compilation'. 
When that function returns from compiling a function definition, the
storage used for that function definition's compilation is entirely freed,
unless it is an inline function (*Note Inline::.).

Here is a list of all the passes of the compiler and their source files. 
Also included is a description of where debugging dumps can be requested
with `-d' options.

   * Parsing.  This pass reads the entire text of a function definition,
     constructing partial syntax trees.  This and RTL generation are no
     longer truly separate passes (formerly they were), but it is easier to
     think of them as separate.

     The tree representation does not entirely follow C syntax, because it
     is intended to support other languages as well.

     C data type analysis is also done in this pass, and every tree node
     that represents an expression has a data type attached.  Variables are
     represented as declaration nodes.

     Constant folding and associative-law simplifications are also done
     during this pass.

     The source files for parsing are `parse.y', `decl.c', `typecheck.c',
     `stor-layout.c', `fold-const.c', and `tree.c'.  The last three are
     intended to be language-independent.  There are also header files
     `parse.h', `c-tree.h', `tree.h' and `tree.def'.  The last two define
     the format of the tree representation.

   * RTL generation.  This is the conversion of syntax tree into RTL code. 
     It is actually done statement-by-statement during parsing, but for
     most purposes it can be thought of as a separate pass.

     This is where the bulk of target-parameter-dependent code is found,
     since often it is necessary for strategies to apply only when certain
     standard kinds of instructions are available.  The purpose of named
     instruction patterns is to provide this information to the RTL
     generation pass.

     Optimization is done in this pass for `if'-conditions that are
     comparisons, boolean operations or conditional expressions.  Tail
     recursion is detected at this time also.  Decisions are made about how
     best to arrange loops and how to output `switch' statements.

     The source files for RTL generation are `stmt.c', `expr.c',
     `explow.c', `expmed.c', `optabs.c' and `emit-rtl.c'.  Also, the file
     `insn-emit.c', generated from the machine description by the program
     `genemit', is used in this pass.  The header files `expr.h' is used
     for communication within this pass.

     The header files `insn-flags.h' and `insn-codes.h', generated from the
     machine description by the programs `genflags' and `gencodes', tell
     this pass which standard names are available for use and which
     patterns correspond to them.

     Aside from debugging information output, none of the following passes
     refers to the tree structure representation of the function (only part
     of which is saved).

     The decision of whether the function can and should be expanded inline
     in its subsequent callers is made at the end of rtl generation.  The
     function must meet certain criteria, currently related to the size of
     the function and the types and number of parameters it has.  Note that
     this function may contain loops, recursive calls to itself
     (tail-recursive functions can be inlined!), gotos, in short, all
     constructs supported by GNU CC.

     The option `-dr' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.rtl' to the input
     file name.

   * Jump optimization.  This pass simplifies jumps to the following
     instruction, jumps across jumps, and jumps to jumps.  It deletes
     unreferenced labels and unreachable code, except that unreachable code
     that contains a loop is not recognized as unreachable in this pass. 
     (Such loops are deleted later in the basic block analysis.)

     Jump optimization is performed two or three times.  The first time is
     immediately following RTL generation.  The second time is after CSE,
     but only if CSE says repeated jump optimization is needed.  The last
     time is right before the final pass.  That time, cross-jumping and
     deletion of no-op move instructions are done together with the
     optimizations described above.

     The source file of this pass is `jump.c'.

     The option `-dj' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass is run for the first time.  This dump file's name is made by
     appending `.jump' to the input file name.

   * Register scan.  This pass finds the first and last use of each
     register, as a guide for common subexpression elimination.  Its source
     is in `regclass.c'.

   * Common subexpression elimination.  This pass also does constant
     propagation.  Its source file is `cse.c'.  If constant propagation
     causes conditional jumps to become unconditional or to become no-ops,
     jump optimization is run again when CSE is finished.

     The option `-ds' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.cse' to the input
     file name.

   * Loop optimization.  This pass moves constant expressions out of loops.
      Its source file is `loop.c'.

     The option `-dL' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.loop' to the input
     file name.

   * Stupid register allocation is performed at this point in a
     nonoptimizing compilation.  It does a little data flow analysis as
     well.  When stupid register allocation is in use, the next pass
     executed is the reloading pass; the others in between are skipped. 
     The source file is `stupid.c'.

   * Data flow analysis (`flow.c').  This pass divides the program into
     basic blocks (and in the process deletes unreachable loops); then it
     computes which pseudo-registers are live at each point in the program,
     and makes the first instruction that uses a value point at the
     instruction that computed the value.

     This pass also deletes computations whose results are never used, and
     combines memory references with add or subtract instructions to make
     autoincrement or autodecrement addressing.

     The option `-df' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.flow' to the input
     file name.  If stupid register allocation is in use, this dump file
     reflects the full results of such allocation.

   * Instruction combination (`combine.c').  This pass attempts to combine
     groups of two or three instructions that are related by data flow into
     single instructions.  It combines the RTL expressions for the
     instructions by substitution, simplifies the result using algebra, and
     then attempts to match the result against the machine description.

     The option `-dc' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.combine' to the
     input file name.

   * Register class preferencing.  The RTL code is scanned to find out
     which register class is best for each pseudo register.  The source
     file is `regclass.c'.

   * Local register allocation (`local-alloc.c').  This pass allocates hard
     registers to pseudo registers that are used only within one basic
     block.  Because the basic block is linear, it can use fast and
     powerful techniques to do a very good job.

     The option `-dl' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.lreg' to the input
     file name.

   * Global register allocation (`global-alloc.c').  This pass allocates
     hard registers for the remaining pseudo registers (those whose life
     spans are not contained in one basic block).

   * Reloading.  This pass renumbers pseudo registers with the hardware
     registers numbers they were allocated.  Pseudo registers that did not
     get hard registers are replaced with stack slots.  Then it finds
     instructions that are invalid because a value has failed to end up in
     a register, or has ended up in a register of the wrong kind.  It fixes
     up these instructions by reloading the problematical values
     temporarily into registers.  Additional instructions are generated to
     do the copying.

     Source files are `reload.c' and `reload1.c', plus the header
     `reload.h' used for communication between them.

     The option `-dg' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.greg' to the input
     file name.

   * Jump optimization is repeated, this time including cross-jumping and
     deletion of no-op move instructions.  Machine-specific peephole
     optimizations are performed at the same time.

     The option `-dJ' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.jump2' to the
     input file name.

   * Final.  This pass outputs the assembler code for the function.  It is
     also responsible for identifying spurious test and compare
     instructions.  The function entry and exit sequences are generated
     directly as assembler code in this pass; they never exist as RTL.

     The source files are `final.c' plus `insn-output.c'; the latter is
     generated automatically from the machine description by the tool
     `genoutput'.  The header file `conditions.h' is used for communication
     between these files.

   * Debugging information output.  This is run after final because it must
     output the stack slot offsets for pseudo registers that did not get
     hard registers.  Source files are `dbxout.c' for DBX symbol table
     format and `symout.c' for GDB's own symbol table format.

Some additional files are used by all or many passes:

   * Every pass uses `machmode.def', which defines the machine modes.

   * All the passes that work with RTL use the header files `rtl.h' and
     `rtl.def', and subroutines in file `rtl.c'.  The tools `gen*' also use
     these files to read and work with the machine description RTL.

   * Several passes refer to the header file `insn-config.h' which contains
     a few parameters (C macro definitions) generated automatically from
     the machine description RTL by the tool `genconfig'.

   * Several passes use the instruction recognizer, which consists of
     `recog.c' and `recog.h', plus the files `insn-recog.c' and
     `insn-extract.c' that are generated automatically from the machine
     description by the tools `genrecog' and `genextract'.

   * Several passes use the header files `regs.h' which defines the
     information recorded about pseudo register usage, and `basic-block.h'
     which defines the information recorded about basic blocks.

   * `hard-reg-set.h' defines the type `HARD_REG_SET', a bit-vector with a
     bit for each hard register, and some macros to manipulate it.  This
     type is just `int' if the machine has few enough hard registers;
     otherwise it is an array of `int' and some of the macros expand into
     loops.

RTL Representation
******************

Most of the work of the compiler is done on an intermediate representation
called register transfer language.  In this language, the instructions to
be output are described, pretty much one by one, in an algebraic form that
describes what the instruction does.

RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.  It has both an internal form, made up of
structures that point at other structures, and a textual form that is used
in the machine description and in printed debugging dumps.  The textual
form uses nested parentheses to indicate the pointers in the internal form.

RTL Object Types
================

RTL uses four kinds of objects: expressions, integers, strings and vectors.
 Expressions are the most important ones.  An RTL expression (``RTX'', for
short) is a C structure, but it is usually referred to with a pointer; a
type that is given the typedef name `rtx'.

An integer is simply an `int', and a string is a `char *'.  Within RTL
code, strings appear only inside `symbol_ref' expressions, but they appear
in other contexts in the RTL expressions that make up machine descriptions.
 Their written form uses decimal digits.

A string is a sequence of characters.  In core it is represented as a `char
*' in usual C fashion, and it is written in C syntax as well.  However,
strings in RTL may never be null.  If you write an empty string in a
machine description, it is represented in core as a null pointer rather
than as a pointer to a null character.  In certain contexts, these null
pointers instead of strings are valid.

A vector contains an arbitrary, specified number of pointers to
expressions.  The number of elements in the vector is explicitly present in
the vector.  The written form of a vector consists of square brackets
(`[...]') surrounding the elements, in sequence and with whitespace
separating them.  Vectors of length zero are not created; null pointers are
used instead.

Expressions are classified by "expression codes" (also called RTX codes). 
The expression code is a name defined in `rtl.def', which is also (in upper
case) a C enumeration constant.  The possible expression codes and their
meanings are machine-independent.  The code of an RTX can be extracted with
the macro `GET_CODE (X)' and altered with `PUT_CODE (X, NEWCODE)'.

The expression code determines how many operands the expression contains,
and what kinds of objects they are.  In RTL, unlike Lisp, you cannot tell
by looking at an operand what kind of object it is.  Instead, you must know
from its context---from the expression code of the containing expression. 
For example, in an expression of code `subreg', the first operand is to be
regarded as an expression and the second operand as an integer.  In an
expression of code `plus', there are two operands, both of which are to be
regarded as expressions.  In a `symbol_ref' expression, there is one
operand, which is to be regarded as a string.

Expressions are written as parentheses containing the name of the
expression type, its flags and machine mode if any, and then the operands
of the expression (separated by spaces).

Expression code names in the `md' file are written in lower case, but when
they appear in C code they are written in upper case.  In this manual, they
are shown as follows: `const_int'.

In a few contexts a null pointer is valid where an expression is normally
wanted.  The written form of this is `(nil)'.


File: internals,  Node: Accessors,  Next: Flags,  Prev: RTL Objects,  Up: RTL

Access to Operands
==================

For each expression type `rtl.def' specifies the number of contained
objects and their kinds, with four possibilities: `e' for expression
(actually a pointer to an expression), `i' for integer, `s' for string, and
`E' for vector of expressions.  The sequence of letters for an expression
code is called its "format".  Thus, the format of `subreg' is `ei'.

Two other format characters are used occasionally: `u' and `0'.  `u' is
equivalent to `e' except that it is printed differently in debugging dumps,
and `0' means a slot whose contents do not fit any normal category.  `0'
slots are not printed at all in dumps, and are often used in special ways
by small parts of the compiler.

There are macros to get the number of operands and the format of an
expression code:

`GET_RTX_LENGTH (CODE)'
     Number of operands of an RTX of code CODE.

`GET_RTX_FORMAT (CODE)'
     The format of an RTX of code CODE, as a C string.

Operands of expressions are accessed using the macros `XEXP', `XINT' and
`XSTR'.  Each of these macros takes two arguments: an expression-pointer
(RTX) and an operand number (counting from zero).  Thus,

     XEXP (X, 2)

accesses operand 2 of expression X, as an expression.

     XINT (X, 2)

accesses the same operand as an integer.  `XSTR', used in the same fashion,
would access it as a string.

Any operand can be accessed as an integer, as an expression or as a string.
 You must choose the correct method of access for the kind of value
actually stored in the operand.  You would do this based on the expression
code of the containing expression.  That is also how you would know how
many operands there are.

For example, if X is a `subreg' expression, you know that it has two
operands which can be correctly accessed as `XEXP (X, 0)' and `XINT (X,
1)'.  If you did `XINT (X, 0)', you would get the address of the expression
operand but cast as an integer; that might occasionally be useful, but it
would be cleaner to write `(int) XEXP (X, 0)'.  `XEXP (X, 1)' would also
compile without error, and would return the second, integer operand cast as
an expression pointer, which would probably result in a crash when
accessed.  Nothing stops you from writing `XEXP (X, 28)' either, but this
will access memory past the end of the expression with unpredictable results.

Access to operands which are vectors is more complicated.  You can use the
macro `XVEC' to get the vector-pointer itself, or the macros `XVECEXP' and
`XVECLEN' to access the elements and length of a vector.

`XVEC (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the vector-pointer which is operand number IDX in EXP.

`XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the length (number of elements) in the vector which is in
     operand number IDX in EXP.  This value is an `int'.

`XVECEXP (EXP, IDX, ELTNUM)'
     Access element number ELTNUM in the vector which is in operand number
     IDX in EXP.  This value is an RTX.

     It is up to you to make sure that ELTNUM is not negative and is less
     than `XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'.

All the macros defined in this section expand into lvalues and therefore
can be used to assign the operands, lengths and vector elements as well as
to access them.

Flags in an RTL Expression
==========================

RTL expressions contain several flags (one-bit bit-fields) that are used in
certain types of expression.

`used'
     This flag is used only momentarily, at the end of RTL generation for a
     function, to count the number of times an expression appears in insns.
      Expressions that appear more than once are copied, according to the
     rules for shared structure (*Note Sharing::.).

`volatil'
     This flag is used in `mem' and `reg' expressions and in insns.  In RTL
     dump files, it is printed as `/v'.

     In a `mem' expression, it is 1 if the memory reference is volatile. 
     Volatile memory references may not be deleted, reordered or combined.

     In a `reg' expression, it is 1 if the value is a user-level variable. 
     0 indicates an internal compiler temporary.

     In an insn, 1 means the insn has been deleted.

`in_struct'
     This flag is used in `mem' expressions.  It is 1 if the memory datum
     referred to is all or part of a structure or array; 0 if it is (or
     might be) a scalar variable.  A reference through a C pointer has 0
     because the pointer might point to a scalar variable.

     This information allows the compiler to determine something about
     possible cases of aliasing.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/s'.

`unchanging'
     This flag is used in `reg' and `mem' expressions.  1 means that the
     value of the expression never changes (at least within the current
     function).

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/u'.

Machine Modes
=============

A machine mode describes a size of data object and the representation used
for it.  In the C code, machine modes are represented by an enumeration
type, `enum machine_mode', defined in `machmode.def'.  Each RTL expression
has room for a machine mode and so do certain kinds of tree expressions
(declarations and types, to be precise).

In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an RTL
expression is written after the expression code with a colon to separate
them.  The letters `mode' which appear at the end of each machine mode name
are omitted.  For example, `(reg:SI 38)' is a `reg' expression with machine
mode `SImode'.  If the mode is `VOIDmode', it is not written at all.

Here is a table of machine modes.

`QImode'
     ``Quarter-Integer'' mode represents a single byte treated as an integer.

`HImode'
     ``Half-Integer'' mode represents a two-byte integer.

`SImode'
     ``Single Integer'' mode represents a four-byte integer.

`DImode'
     ``Double Integer'' mode represents an eight-byte integer.

`TImode'
     ``Tetra Integer'' (?) mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.

`SFmode'
     ``Single Floating'' mode represents a single-precision (four byte)
     floating point number.

`DFmode'
     ``Double Floating'' mode represents a double-precision (eight byte)
     floating point number.

`TFmode'
     ``Tetra Floating'' mode represents a quadruple-precision (sixteen
     byte) floating point number.

`BLKmode'
     ``Block'' mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
     the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have this
     mode, and only if they appear in string-move or vector instructions. 
     On machines which have no such instructions, `BLKmode' will not appear
     in RTL.

`VOIDmode'
     Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode.  For
     example, RTL expressions of code `const_int' have mode `VOIDmode'
     because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context requires. 
     In debugging dumps of RTL, `VOIDmode' is expressed by the absence of
     any mode.

`EPmode'
     ``Entry Pointer'' mode is intended to be used for function variables
     in Pascal and other block structured languages.  Such values contain
     both a function address and a static chain pointer for access to
     automatic variables of outer levels.  This mode is only partially
     implemented since C does not use it.

`CSImode, ...'
     ``Complex Single Integer'' mode stands for a complex number
     represented as a pair of `SImode' integers.  Any of the integer and
     floating modes may have `C' prefixed to its name to obtain a complex
     number mode.  For example, there are `CQImode', `CSFmode', and
     `CDFmode'.  Since C does not support complex numbers, these machine
     modes are only partially implemented.

`BImode'
     This is the machine mode of a bit-field in a structure.  It is used
     only in the syntax tree, never in RTL, and in the syntax tree it
     appears only in declaration nodes.  In C, it appears only in
     `FIELD_DECL' nodes for structure fields defined with a bit size.

The machine description defines `Pmode' as a C macro which expands into the
machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is `SImode'.

The only modes which a machine description must support are `QImode',
`SImode', `SFmode' and `DFmode'.  The compiler will attempt to use `DImode'
for two-word structures and unions, but it would not be hard to program it
to avoid this.  Likewise, you can arrange for the C type `short int' to
avoid using `HImode'.  In the long term it would be desirable to make the
set of available machine modes machine-dependent and eliminate all
assumptions about specific machine modes or their uses from the
machine-independent code of the compiler.

Here are some C macros that relate to machine modes:

`GET_MODE (X)'
     Returns the machine mode of the RTX X.

`PUT_MODE (X, NEWMODE)'
     Alters the machine mode of the RTX X to be NEWMODE.

`GET_MODE_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_BITSIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bits of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bits of the subunits of a datum of mode M.  This
     is the same as `GET_MODE_SIZE' except in the case of complex modes and
     `EPmode'.  For them, the unit size is the size of the real or
     imaginary part, or the size of the function pointer or the context
     pointer.

Constant Expression Types
=========================

The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant values.

`(const_int I)'
     This type of expression represents the integer value I.  I is
     customarily accessed with the macro `INTVAL' as in `INTVAL (EXP)',
     which is equivalent to `XINT (EXP, 0)'.

     There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it is
     the value of the variable `const0_rtx'.  Likewise, the only expression
     for integer value one is found in `const1_rtx'.  Any attempt to create
     an expression of code `const_int' and value zero or one will return
     `const0_rtx' or `const1_rtx' as appropriate.

`(const_double:M I0 I1)'
     Represents a floating point constant value of mode M.  The two
     inteGERS I0 and I1 together contain the bits of a `double' value.  To
     convert them to a `double', do

          union { double d; int i[2];} u;
          u.i[0] = XINT (x, 0);
          u.i[1] = XINT (x, 1);

     and then refer to `u.d'.  The value of the constant is represented as
     a double in this fashion even if the value represented is
     single-precision.

     The global variables `dconst0_rtx' and `fconst0_rtx' hold
     `const_double' expressions with value 0, in modes `DFmode' and
     `SFmode', respectively.

`(symbol_ref SYMBOL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  SYMBOL is a
     string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it starts
     with a `*', the label is the rest of SYMBOL not including the `*'. 
     Otherwise, the label is SYMBOL, prefixed with `_'.

`(label_ref LABEL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains one
     operand, an expression, which must be a `code_label' that appears in
     the instruction sequence to identify the place where the label should
     go.

     The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
     references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.

`(const EXP)'
     Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
     arithmetic computation.  The operand, EXP, is an expression that
     contains only constants (`const_int', `symbol_ref' and `label_ref'
     expressions) combined with `plus' and `minus'.  However, not all
     combinations are valid, since the assembler cannot do arbitrary
     arithmetic on relocatable symbols.

Registers and Memory
====================

Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
registers and to main memory.

`(reg:M N)'
     For small values of the integer N (less than `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'),
     this stands for a reference to machine register number N: a "hard
     register".  For larger values of N, it stands for a temporary value or
     "pseudo register".  The compiler's strategy is to generate code
     assuming an unlimited number of such pseudo registers, and later
     convert them into hard registers or into memory references.

     The symbol `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER' is defined by the machine
     description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is an
     invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that not all
     of the machine registers must be general registers.  All the machine
     registers that can be used for storage of data are given hard register
     numbers, even those that can be used only in certain instructions or
     can hold only certain types of data.

     Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
     represented by a unique `reg' expression.

     M is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
     machines can generally refer to each register in more than one mode. 
     For example, a register may contain a full word but there may be
     instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single byte, as
     well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point number of
     various precisions.

     Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode, the
     mode must always be specified.

     A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
     function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode and is
     accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe an
     access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a `subreg'
     expression is used.

     A `reg' expression with a machine mode that specifies more than one
     word of data may actually stand for several consecutive registers.  If
     in addition the register number specifies a hardware register, then it
     actually represents several consecutive hardware registers starting
     with the specified one.

     Such multi-word hardware register `reg' expressions may not be live
     across the boundary of a basic block.  The lifetime analysis pass does
     not know how to record properly that several consecutive registers are
     actually live there, and therefore register allocation would be
     confused.  The CSE pass must go out of its way to make sure the
     situation does not arise.

`(subreg:M REG WORDNUM)'
     `subreg' expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine mode
     other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of a
     multi-word `reg' that actually refers to several registers.

     Each pseudo-register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
     operate on it in a different mode---for example, to perform a fullword
     move instruction on a pseudo-register that contains a single byte---
     the pseudo-register must be enclosed in a `subreg'.  In such a case,
     WORDNUM is zero.

     The other use of `subreg' is to extract the individual registers of a
     multi-register value.  Machine modes such as `DImode' and `EPmode'
     indicate values longer than a word, values which usually require two
     consecutive registers.  To access one of the registers, use a `subreg'
     with mode `SImode' and a WORDNUM that says which register.

     The compilation parameter `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN', if defined, says that
     word number zero is the most significant part; otherwise, it is the
     least significant part.

     Note that it is not valid to access a `DFmode' value in `SFmode' using
     a `subreg'.  On some machines the most significant part of a `DFmode'
     value does not have the same format as a single-precision floating
     value.

`(cc0)'
     This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
     operands and may not have a machine mode.  It may be validly used in
     only two contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
     compare instructions) and in comparison operators comparing against
     zero (`const_int' with value zero; that is to say, `const0_rtx').

     There is only one expression object of code `cc0'; it is the value of
     the variable `cc0_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
     `cc0' will return `cc0_rtx'.

     One special thing about the condition code register is that
     instructions can set it implicitly.  On many machines, nearly all
     instructions set the condition code based on the value that they
     compute or store.  It is not necessary to record these actions
     explicitly in the RTL because the machine description includes a
     prescription for recognizing the instructions that do so (by means of
     the macro `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC').  Only instructions whose sole purpose
     is to set the condition code, and instructions that use the condition
     code, need mention `(cc0)'.

`(pc)'
     This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands and
     may not have a machine mode.  `(pc)' may be validly used only in
     certain specific contexts in jump instructions.

     There is only one expression object of code `pc'; it is the value of
     the variable `pc_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
     `pc' will return `pc_rtx'.

     All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter implicitly
     by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention this in the RTL.

`(mem:M ADDR)'
     This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
     represented by the expression ADDR.  M specifies how large a unit of
     memory is accessed.

RTL Expressions for Arithmetic
==============================

`(plus:M X Y)'
     Represents the sum of the values represented by X and Y carried out in
     machine mode M.  This is valid only if X and Y both are valid for mode
     M.

`(minus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus' but represents subtraction.

`(minus X Y)'
     Represents the result of subtracting Y from X for purposes of
     comparison.  The absence of a machine mode in the `minus' expression
     indicates that the result is computed without overflow, as if with
     infinite precision.

     Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision. 
     However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the result
     will be used, which is the case when the result is stored in `(cc0)'. 
     And that is the only way this kind of expression may validly be used:
     as a value to be stored in the condition codes.

`(neg:M X)'
     Represents the negation (subtraction from zero) of the value
     represented by X, carried out in mode M.  X must be valid for mode M.

`(mult:M X Y)'
     Represents the signed product of the values represented by X and Y
     carried out in machine mode M.  If X and Y are both valid for mode M,
     this is ordinary size-preserving multiplication.  Alternatively, both
     X and Y may be valid for a different, narrower mode.  This represents
     the kind of multiplication that generates a product wider than the
     operands.  Widening multiplication and same-size multiplication are
     completely distinct and supported by different machine instructions;
     machines may support one but not the other.

     `mult' may be used for floating point division as well.  Then M is a
     floating point machine mode.

`(umult:M X Y)'
     Like `mult' but represents unsigned multiplication.  It may be used in
     both same-size and widening forms, like `mult'.  `umult' is used only
     for fixed-point multiplication.

`(div:M X Y)'
     Represents the quotient in signed division of X by Y, carried out in
     machine mode M.  If M is a floating-point mode, it represents the
     exact quotient; otherwise, the integerized quotient.  If X and Y are
     both valid for mode M, this is ordinary size-preserving division. 
     Some machines have division instructions in which the operands and
     quotient widths are not all the same; such instructions are
     represented by `div' expressions in which the machine modes are not
     all the same.

`(udiv:M X Y)'
     Like `div' but represents unsigned division.

`(mod:M X Y)'
`(umod:M X Y)'
     Like `div' and `udiv' but represent the remainder instead of the
     quotient.

`(not:M X)'
     Represents the bitwise complement of the value represented by X,
     carried out in mode M, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.  X
     must be valid for mode M, which must be a fixed-point mode.

`(and:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise logical-and of the values represented by X and
     Y, carried out in machine mode M.  This is valid only if X and Y both
     are valid for mode M, which must be a fixed-point mode.

`(ior:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise inclusive-or of the values represented by X and
     Y, carried out in machine mode M.  This is valid only if X and Y both
     are valid for mode M, which must be a fixed-point mode.

`(xor:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise exclusive-or of the values represented by X and
     Y, carried out in machine mode M.  This is valid only if X and Y both
     are valid for mode M, which must be a fixed-point mode.

`(lshift:M X C)'
     Represents the result of logically shifting X left by C places.  X
     must be valid for the mode M, a fixed-point machine mode.  C must be
     valid for a fixed-point mode; which mode is determined by the mode
     called for in the machine description entry for the left-shift
     instruction.  For example, on the Vax, the mode of C is `QImode'
     regardless of M.

     On some machines, negative values of C may be meaningful; this is why
     logical left shift and arithmetic left shift are distinguished.  For
     example, Vaxes have no right-shift instructions, and right shifts are
     represented as left-shift instructions whose counts happen to be
     negative constants or else computed (in a previous instruction) by
     negation.

`(ashift:M X C)'
     Like `lshift' but for arithmetic left shift.

`(lshiftrt:M X C)'
`(ashiftrt:M X C)'
     Like `lshift' and `ashift' but for right shift.

`(rotate:M X C)'
`(rotatert:M X C)'
     Similar but represent left and right rotate.

`(abs:M X)'
     Represents the absolute value of X, computed in mode M.  X must be
     valid for M.

`(sqrt:M X)'
     Represents the square root of X, computed in mode M.  X must be valid
     for M.  Most often M will be a floating point mode.

`(ffs:M X)'
     Represents the one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit in X,
     represented as an integer of mode M.  (The value is zero if X is
     zero.)  The mode of X need not be M; depending on the target machine,
     various mode combinations may be valid.

Comparison Operations
=====================

Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are considered to
represent the value 1 if the relation holds, or zero if it does not.  The
mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they must both be
valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both operands constant
would be invalid as the machine mode could not be deduced from it, but such
a comparison should never exist in RTL due to constant folding.

Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.  Thus,
there are distinct expression codes `gt' and `gtu' for signed and unsigned
greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same pair of
integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not unsigned
greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually `0xffffffff'
which is greater than 1.

The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.  Floating
point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of the operands.

The comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes `(cc0)'
against zero, as in `(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))'.  Such a construct actually
refers to the result of the preceding instruction in which the condition
codes were set.  The above example stands for 1 if the condition codes were
set to say ``zero'' or ``equal'', 0 otherwise.  Although the same
comparison operators are used for this as may be used in other contexts on
actual data, no confusion can result since the machine description would
never allow both kinds of uses in the same context.

`(eq X Y)'
     1 if the values represented by X and Y are equal, otherwise 0.

`(ne X Y)'
     1 if the values represented by X and Y are not equal, otherwise 0.

`(gt X Y)'
     1 if the X is greater than Y.  If they are fixed-point, the comparison
     is done in a signed sense.

`(gtu X Y)'
     Like `gt' but does unsigned comparison, on fixed-point numbers only.

`(lt X Y)'
`(ltu X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for ``less than''.

`(ge X Y)'
`(geu X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for ``greater than or equal''.

`(le X Y)'
`(leu X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for ``less than or equal''.

`(if_then_else COND THEN ELSE)'
     This is not a comparison operation but is listed here because it is
     always used in conjunction with a comparison operation.  To be
     precISE, COND is a comparison expression.  This expression represents
     a choice, according to COND, between the value represented by THEN and
     the one represented by ELSE.

     On most machines, `if_then_else' expressions are valid only to express
     conditional jumps.

Bit-fields
==========

Special expression codes exist to represent bit-field instructions.  These
types of expressions are lvalues in RTL; they may appear on the left side
of a assignment, indicating insertion of a value into the specified bit
field.

`(sign_extract:SI LOC SIZE POS)'
     This represents a reference to a sign-extended bit-field contained or
     starting in LOC (a memory or register reference).  The bit field is
     SIZE bits wide and starts at bit POS.  The compilation option
     `BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' says which end of the memory unit POS counts from.

     Which machine modes are valid for LOC depends on the machine, but
     typically LOC should be a single byte when in memory or a full word in
     a register.

`(zero_extract:SI LOC SIZE POS)'
     Like `sign_extract' but refers to an unsigned or zero-extended bit
     field.  The same sequence of bits are extracted, but they are filled
     to an entire word with zeros instead of by sign-extension.


File: internals,  Node: Conversions,  Next: RTL Declarations,  Prev: Bit Fields,  Up: RTL

Conversions
===========

All conversions between machine modes must be represented by explicit
conversion operations.  For example, an expression which is the sum of a
byte and a full word cannot be written as `(plus:SI (reg:QI 34) (reg:SI
80))' because the `plus' operation requires two operands of the same
machine mode.  Therefore, the byte-sized operand is enclosed in a
conversion operation, as in

     (plus:SI (sign_extend:SI (reg:QI 34)) (reg:SI 80))

The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there may be
more than one way of converting from a given starting mode to the desired
final mode.  The conversion operation code says how to do it.

`(sign_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of sign-extending the value X to machine mode M.
      M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode
     narrower than M.

`(zero_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of zero-extending the value X to machine mode M.
      M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode
     narrower than M.

`(float_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of extending the value X to machine mode M.  M
     must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a mode
     narrower than M.

`(truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.  M
     must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode wider
     than M.

`(float_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.  M
     must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a mode
     wider than M.

`(float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded as
     signed, to floating point mode M.

`(unsigned_float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded as
     unsigned, to floating point mode M.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a fixed point mode, represents the result of converting
     floating point value X to mode M, regarded as signed.  How rounding is
     done is not specified, so this operation may be used validly in
     compiling C code only for integer-valued operands.

`(unsigned_fix:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting floating point value X to fixed
     point mode M, regarded as unsigned.  How rounding is done is not
     specified.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a floating point mode, represents the result of converting
     floating point value X (valid for mode M) to an integer, still
     represented in floating point mode M, by rounding towards zero.

Declarations
============

Declaration expression codes do not represent arithmetic operations but
rather state assertions about their operands.

`(strict_low_part (subreg:M (reg:N R) 0))'
     This expression code is used in only one context: operand 0 of a `set'
     expression.  In addition, the operand of this expression must be a
     `subreg' expression.

     The presence of `strict_low_part' says that the part of the register
     which is meaningful in mode N, but is not part of mode M, is not to be
     altered.  Normally, an assignment to such a subreg is allowed to have
     undefined effects on the rest of the register when M is less than a
     word.
