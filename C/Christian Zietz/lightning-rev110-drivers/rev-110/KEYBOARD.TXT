USB Keyboard Driver for TOS & MiNT
Developed by Christian Zietz - Licensed under GPL

This driver is to be considered a beta version. Yet it has been successfully tested with the Lightning VME USB card for Atari MegaSTE and Atari TT and with a lot of different keyboards.

This driver directly maps keys from the USB keyboard to the Atari keyboard. This means that if you for example connect a keyboard to a German Atari, you'll get a German layout, regardless of the layout of the USB keyboard. In particular, for Atari layouts that require you pressing Alt+key to type certain characters (e.g. on the German layout Alt+Ü gives "@"), you have to use the same key combination on the USB keyboard, not the combination that you're used to from your PC or Mac.

Mapping of keys that do not exist on a PC keyboard:
F11 -> Help
F12 -> Undo
Page up -> Numeric keypad (
Page down -> Numeric keypad )
Home -> Clr Home

Caps lock is implemented, however currently the LED of the keyboard won't light. Keys without an equivalent on the Atari are without function.
