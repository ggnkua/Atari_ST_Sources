Installation:

There isn't much to configure.  If you really want to change the
default pool size, edit the definition of int pool_size near the top
of buffers.c (currently 512).

Edit the Makefile if you want to change compiler options.  You can add
in the -DNODEBUG define if you like; it will compile out the -d (debug
mode) switch from [e]defrag, and will also omit the run-time consistency
checks.

Just type "make" (or "make dep; make" if your include files aren't in
the same place as mine).  You will have to copy the executables to
/bin yourself.
