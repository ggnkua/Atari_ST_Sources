The InfoTaskForce Guide to Z-Code Versions
==========================================
Copyright (c) 1992 InfoTaskForce


Introduction
------------

Infocom have produced several different Z-Code Interpreters, each one
providing more features than the previous ones. The first byte of each
game's data file indicates which interpreter version it was compiled to use.
This file describes some of the differences between Z-Code versions.


Z-Code Version 1.
-----------------

The initial Infocom games produced for the Apple ][ series of 
personal computers running Apple DOS 3.2 used Z-Code Version 1. The 
Z-Machine's stack was 512 bytes. The resident portion of a data file 
was limited to less than 48 Kbytes (the limit of the Apple ][+ main 
memory).

Features of the Version 1 interpreter included:

*	The global property table was $35 bytes.
*	The maximum number of properties per object is 32.
*	The maximum length of any property is 8 bytes.
*	Any address given in Page/Offset form represents a data 
	file offset in words, not bytes.

The Version 1 object structure was as follows:

typedef struct
{
	byte	attributes[4] ;
	byte	location[1] ;
	byte	link[1] ;
	byte	holds[1] ;
	byte	prop_ptr[2] ;
} std_object ;

The Version 1 data file header has the following structure:

struct	header
{
	byte	z_code_version ;	/* Game's Z-CODE Version Number    */
	byte	mode_bits ;		/* Status Bar display indicator    */
	word	release ;		/* Game Release Number             */
	word	resident_bytes ;	/* No. bytes in the Resident Area  */
	word	start ;			/* Offset to Start of Game         */
	word	vocab ;			/* Offset to VocabtList            */
	word	object_list ;		/* Offset to Object/Room List      */
	word	globals ;		/* Offset to Global Variables      */
	word	save_bytes ;		/* No. bytes in the Save Game Area */
	word	padding[24] ;		/* Blank                           */
} ;

 

Z-Code Version 2.
-----------------

Infocom games produced for the Apple ][ running DOS 3.3 
initially used Z-Code Version 2 (and later Z-Code Version 3). Version 2 
introduced several minor enhancements:

*	The character table used in the encoding of the game's 
	vocabulary and text was changed.
*	The method of encoding a carriage return/line feed was 
	changed.
*	The concept of a common word list was introduced.

The Version 2 data file header has the following structure:

struct	header
{
	byte	z_code_version ;	/* Game's Z-CODE Version Number    */
	byte	mode_bits ;		/* Status Bar display indicator    */
	word	release ;		/* Game Release Number             */
	word	resident_bytes ;	/* No. bytes in the Resident Area  */
	word	start ;			/* Offset to Start of Game         */
	word	vocab ;			/* Offset to VocabtList            */
	word	object_list ;		/* Offset to Object/Room List      */
	word	globals ;		/* Offset to Global Variables      */
	word	save_bytes ;		/* No. bytes in the Save Game Area */
	word	script_status ;		/* Z-CODE printing modes           */
	char	serial_no[6] ;		/* Game's Serial Number            */
	word	common_word ;		/* Offset to Common Word List      */
	word	padding[19] ;		/* Blank                           */
} ;

 

Z-Code Version 3. ("Standard")
-----------------

The most common game format is Z-Code Version 3, which includes games
such as:
	Ballyhoo	Cutthroats		Deadline
	Enchanter	Hitchhiker		Hollywood Hijinx
	Infidel		Leather Goddesses	Lurking Horror
	Moonmist	Planetfall		Plundered Hearts
	Seastalker	Sorceror		Spellbreaker
	Starcross	Stationfall		Suspect
	Suspended	Wishbringer		Witness	
	Zork I		Zork II			Zork III

Version 3 introduced the following enhancements:

*	The common word list was expanded from one bank of 64 
	words to 3 banks of 64 words.
*	The way of encoding capital letters and punctuation 
	symbols was changed.
*	Two new opcodes: "prt_status" (Opcode 0xBC) and 
	"verify" (Opcode 0xBD). Neither opcode takes any 
	arguements. The "verify" opcode is used to verify the 
	integrity of the game's data file and the "prt_status" opcode 
	prints the status bar at the top of the screen. In previous 
	versions, the status bar was printed solely by a subroutine 
	of the "input" opcode.
*	Some Version 3 interpreters included two additional 
	opcodes for use on machines with control over the cursor 
	and CRT being used. These are "split_screen" (Opcode 
	0xEA) and "set_current_window" (Opcode 0xEB). If an 
	interpreter includes these opcodes, it should set bit 5 of 
	the "mode_bits" byte in the data file's header before 
	running the game. The data file contains opcodes which 
	examine this byte on the fly and only execute these opcodes 
	if bit 5 is set. Each take a single arguement. The only 
	game that I have found that uses these opcodes is 
	Seastalker (Revision: 15) - when in the scimitar submarine,
	type "set sonar to auto" invokes a splitting of the display
	into two windows. Typing "set sonar to manual" restores the
	screen to normal. This data file also makes use of the TANDY
	flag in the game header's "mode_bits" field and the
	USE_NON_PROP_FONT flag in the game header's "script_status" field.

The Version 3 data file header has the following structure:

struct	header
{
	byte	z_code_version ;	/* Game's Z-CODE Version Number    */
	byte	mode_bits ;		/* Status Bar display indicator    */
	word	release ;		/* Game Release Number             */
	word	resident_bytes ;	/* No. bytes in the Resident Area  */
	word	start ;			/* Offset to Start of Game         */
	word	vocab ;			/* Offset to VocabtList            */
	word	object_list ;		/* Offset to Object/Room List      */
	word	globals ;		/* Offset to Global Variables      */
	word	save_bytes ;		/* No. bytes in the Save Game Area */
	word	script_status ;		/* Z-CODE printing modes           */
	char	serial_no[6] ;		/* Game's Serial Number            */
	word	common_word ;		/* Offset to Common Word List      */
	word	verify_length ;		/* No. words in the Game File      */
	word	verify_checksum ;	/* Game Checksum - used by Verify  */
	word	padding[17] ;		/* Blank                           */
} ;


Z-Code Version 4. ("Plus")
-----------------

Z-Code was completely overhauled with the introduction of Version 
4, which lifted many of the memory size constraints imposed on the 
earlier interpreter versions. This allowed games such as

	A Mind Forever Voyaging			Bureaucracy
	Nord & Bert				Trinity

to be created.  The changes in Z-Code Version 4 included:

*	The Z-Machine's stack was increased from 512 bytes to 
	1024 bytes.
*	The memory limit of 48 Kbytes placed on the resident 
	portion of a data file was changed to 128 Kbytes.
*	The size of the vocabulary words was increased from 6 
	characters to 9 characters.
*	The size of the global property table was increased from 
	$35 bytes to $70 bytes.
*	The maximum number of properties per object was 
	increased from 32 to 64.
*	The maximum length of any property was increased from 8 
	bytes to 64 bytes.
*	Any address given in Page/Offset form represents a data 
	file offset in longwords, not words as in previous versions.
*	In order to increase the number of objects in a game 
	above the 256 object limit imposed in earlier interpreter 
	versions, the definition of an object was changed to the 
	following:

typedef struct
{
	byte	attributes[6] ;
	byte	location[2] ;
	byte	link[2] ;
	byte	holds[2] ;
	byte	prop_ptr[2] ;
} plus_object ;

*	This change in the definition of an object caused the 
	following opcodes to be modified: "get_link", "get_holds", 
	"get_loc", "get_p_len", "remove_obj", "p_obj", "check_loc", 
	"test_attr", "set_attr", "clr_attr", "transfer", "get_prop", 
	"get_prop_addr", "get_next_prop" and "put_prop".
*	The following opcodes were also modified: "print2", 
	"gosub" and "random".
*	The "prt_status" opcode was removed.
*	The following new opcodes were introduced: "gosub2", 
	"gosub3", "clear_screen", "erase_line", "set_cursor_posn", 
	"null2", "set_text_mode", "io_buffer_mode", "io_mode", 
	"null3", "beep", "get_key" and "compare2".

The Version 4 data file header has the following structure:

struct	header
{
	byte	z_code_version ;	/* Game's Z-CODE Version Number       */
	byte	mode_bits ;		/* Status Bar display indicator       */
	word	release ;		/* Game Release Number                */
	word	resident_bytes ;	/* No. bytes in the Resident Area     */
	word	start ;			/* Offset to Start of Game            */
	word	vocab ;			/* Offset to VocabtList               */
	word	object_list ;		/* Offset to Object/Room List         */
	word	globals ;		/* Offset to Global Variables         */
	word	save_bytes ;		/* No. bytes in the Save Game Area    */
	word	script_status ;		/* Z-CODE printing modes              */
	char	serial_no[6] ;		/* Game's Serial Number               */
	word	common_word ;		/* Offset to Common Word List         */
	word	verify_length ;		/* No. words in the Game File         */
	word	verify_checksum ;	/* Game Checksum - used by Verify     */
	byte	interpreter_number ;	/* Number - Set by Interpreter        */
	byte	interpreter_version ;	/* ASCII Char - Set by Interpreter    */
	byte	screen_height ;		/* Screen Height - Set by Interpreter */
	byte	screen_width ;		/* Screen Width - Set by Interpreter  */
	word	padding[15] ;		/* Blank                              */
} ;

 

Z-Code Version 5. ("Advanced")
-----------------

The screen handling facilities of Version 4 were enhanced with 
the release of Version 5 allowing such games as:

	Beyond Zork	Border Zone		Sherlock

Enhancements included the addition of mouse support (for machines like the
Macintosh and the IBM PC) and sound (the game Sherlock for the Macintosh
initially contained no sound support. A sound data file was included in a
later release). Support was also added for extended charcter sets (the game
Beyond Zork on the IBM PC uses the extended IBM PC character set to print
graphics symbols and on the Macintosh uses a custom font for the same purpose).

The following changes were made in Version 5:

*	The following opcodes were removed: "save_game" and "restore_game".
*	The following opcodes were modified: "pop_stack","rtn","gosub" and
	"compare2".
*	The "not" opcode was moved.
*	The following opcodes were added: "branch_true","gosub4", "gosub5",
	"throw_away_stack_frame", "parse", "encrypt", "block_copy",
	"print_text", "num_local_params", "logical_shift",
	"arithmetic_shift", "clear_flag", "test_byte_array" and "set_flag".

The Version 5 data file header has the following structure:

struct	header
{
	byte	z_code_version ;	/* Game's Z-CODE Version Number       */
	byte	mode_bits ;		/* Status Bar display indicator       */
	word	release ;		/* Game Release Number                */
	word	resident_bytes ;	/* No. bytes in the Resident Area     */
	word	start ;			/* Offset to Start of Game            */
	word	vocab ;			/* Offset to VocabtList               */
	word	object_list ;		/* Offset to Object/Room List         */
	word	globals ;		/* Offset to Global Variables         */
	word	save_bytes ;		/* No. bytes in the Save Game Area    */
	word	script_status ;		/* Z-CODE printing modes              */
	char	serial_no[6] ;		/* Game's Serial Number               */
	word	common_word ;		/* Offset to Common Word List         */

	byte	screen_height ;		/* Screen Height - Set by Interpreter */
	byte	screen_width ;		/* Screen Width  - Set by Interpreter */
	byte	left ;			/* Left Coord. - Set by Interpreter   */
	byte	right ;			/* Right Coord. - Set by Interpreter  */
	byte	top ;			/* Top Coordinate - Set by Interpreter*/
	byte	bottom ;		/* Bottom Coord. - Set by Interpreter */
	byte	unknown1 ;		/* Unknown - Set by Interpreter       */
	byte	unknown2 ;		/* Unknown - Set by Interpreter       */
	word	padding1[2] ;		/* Blank                              */
	byte	unknown3 ;		/* Unknown - Set by Interpreter       */
	byte	unknown4 ;		/* Unknown - Set by Interpreter       */
	word	unknown5 ;		/* Unknown         - Set in Data File */
	word	padding2[3] ;		/* Blank                              */
