<h1><a name="Overview">Bugs and Changes</a></h1>
<p>This document contains the list of all known bugs and the list of all changes between game versions (some of which are bug fixes). Each one is identified by a unique name containing two numbers:</p>
<ul><li>A number between 0 and 8 identifying the game version where the bug or change was introduced:
<ul><li>0: DM for Atari ST 1.0a EN</li>
<li>1: DM for Atari ST 1.0b EN</li>
<li>2: DM for Atari ST 1.1 EN</li>
<li>3: DM for Atari ST 1.2 EN</li>
<li>4: DM for Atari ST 1.2 GE</li>
<li>5: DM for Atari ST 1.3a FR</li>
<li>6: DM for Atari ST 1.3b FR</li>
<li>7: CSB for Atari ST 2.0 EN</li>
<li>8: CSB for Atari ST 2.1 EN</li></ul></li>
<li>An unique increment value.</li>
<li>Change identifiers also contain one category identifier:
<ul><li>FIX: changes to fix bugs.</li>
<li>OPTIMIZATION: changes without any significant effect on the behavior of the game. Such changes may improve performance, minimize machine code size or lead to cleaner source code.</li>
<li>LOCALIZATION: changes required by the translation of the game to another language.</li>
<li>IMPROVEMENT: all changes that are not in other categories. Most of these changes add new features or tweak the behavior of the game.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>For example, CHANGE3_07_FIX identifies the 7th change introduced in DM for Atari ST 1.2 EN.</p>
<p>For more details, please refer to the source code by searching for the identifier of the bug or change. Many text editors allow searching for a keyword like 'BUG0_00' or 'CHANGE1_00_OPTIMIZATION' in multiple files, my recommendation is <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="BUG0_02">BUG0_02</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>After playing a single game for hundreds of hours (in one row or across multiple save/load cycles) the game starts to behave strangely and then hangs.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Even though the game time is stored in a 32 bit value, event times in the timeline are stored on 24 bits so the maximum possible time value is 2^24 - 1 = 16777215 (around 850 to 1000 hours of actual play time). Issues occur because new events scheduled to occur in the future are actually scheduled in the past and then expire immediately. For example, if you use the 'Light' action of the Yew Staff or Sceptre Of Lyf when the game time is 16776500 then an event to remove the light will be scheduled at (16775000 + 2500) Mod 2^24 = 284 and will thus expire immediately so that the light will only be visible for a very short moment. When the game time reaches 16777200 (the largest multiple of 300 that is smaller than the maximum value of 16777216), the time of the next watchdog event is set to (16777200 + 300) Mod 2^24 = 284 and thus expires immediately. The timeline processing then enters an infinite loop where it constantly processes the same watchdog event, causing the game to hang.</dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_03">BUG0_03</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Graphical glitch. When the processor is under heavy load, a few lines at the top of the dungeon view may be drawn on screen with the wrong color palette. This is only visible for a very short amount of time and disappears on the next vertical scan.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>If a vertical blank exception occurs before the previous vertical blank exception handler has completed execution then it is ignored. As the game implements palette switching to draw the dungeon view in the vertical blank exception handler, the appropriate palette is not configured at the right time and causes the top of the dungeon view to use the same color palette as the top of the screen. This is only visible when the palette used to draw the dungeon is not the same as the one used to draw the rest of the screen, which is when the light level in the dungeon is not at its maximum. The issue occurs when the processor is under heavy load because many other interrupts occur with a higher priority level than the vertical blank interrupt, such as sound and mouse processing.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>You need low light conditions in the dungeon: wait until all 'Torch' and 'Light' spells expire and remove any torches from champion hands. Also do not stay on the initial dungeon map where the champion portraits are available as light is always maximum there.</li>
<li>Continuously bump into walls by using the arrows on the keyboard so that a sound is played while also moving the mouse very quickly around the screen. The graphical glitch should be visible from time to time.<br/>

<dd>MAIN.C</dd>
<dt>Resolution</dt>
<dd>Fixed in CSB for Atari ST 2.0 EN, 2.1 EN (see <a href="#CHANGE7_01_FIX">CHANGE7_01_FIX</a>). The vertical blank handler is changed so that no vertical blank interrupts can be ignored and the palette switching code always starts right on time.</dd></dl>
<h3><a name="BUG0_04">BUG0_04</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Some creatures may be drawn with unexpected colors in Dungeon Master.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>In the color palettes used to draw the dungeon view, two colors (9 and 10) are only used by creature graphics and each creature type can specify replacement colors to use instead of the default colors. Creature types that do not use these colors can specify that no replacement is needed. Each map in the dungeon has an associated list of allowed creature types. If multiple creatures with conflicting color replacements are allowed on the same map then each replacement color is defined by the creature type that appears the last in the list of allowed creature types. There are no such conflicts in Dungeon Master.<br/>
However, the side bitmap of 'Giant Wasp' uses color 10 but no replacement is specified. In the game, the actual color used is not the same on all maps where they are present: on map 3 the color is the one defined by 'Magenta Worm', on map 5 it is the color defined by 'Wizard Eye' and on map 10 it is the color defined by 'Water Elemental'.<br/>
All bitmaps for 'Swamp Slime' use both colors 9 and 10 but replacement is only specified for color 10. On the map where this creature is used, there are no other creatures defining color 9 so the default color is used which is appropriate. However, this color should be explicitly specified.<br/>
The front, side and attack bitmaps for 'Lord Chaos' use color 9 but no replacement is specified. On the map where this creature is used, the colors defined by the Demon are used, which are also appropriate for Lord Chaos. However, these colors should be explicitly specified.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>For 'Giant Wasp', in Dungeon Master go to maps 3, 5 and 10 to see them from the side: the color of the abdomen below the wings is different on each map:<br/>
<img src="IMAGES/BUG0_04_1.png" alt=""/> <img src="IMAGES/BUG0_04_2.png" alt=""/> <img src="IMAGES/BUG0_04_3.png" alt=""/></li>
<li>For 'Swamp Slime' and 'Lord Chaos', create a custom dungeon, add a creature that replaces colors 9 and 10 and then add one of these creatures in the list of allowed creatures. When playing the game, the colors of the first creature will be used instead of the expected colors.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_05">BUG0_05</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>A champion portrait sensor on a wall square is visible on all sides of the wall. If there is another sensor with a wall ornament on one side of the wall then the champion portrait is drawn over that wall ornament.
This issue only affects custom dungeons. It does not exist in the original dungeons where all walls with portraits have only one visible side and no other sensors with wall ornaments.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Champion portraits are managed as a special case when drawing wall ornaments. They are always drawn after any other ornament and the sensor cell on the wall is ignored.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Create a custom dungeon and place a champion portrait sensor on a wall that has more than one side visible.</li>
<li>Add another sensor with a wall ornament on one of the visible sides of the wall.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_06">BUG0_06</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Graphical glitch when drawing projectiles or explosions.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>If a projectile or explosion bitmap is cropped because it is only partly visible on the left side of the viewport and the bitmap is flipped horizontally then a wrong part of the bitmap is drawn on screen. This issue does not apply to object bitmaps and to projectiles drawn with object bitmaps because those are only flipped horizontally when being drawn in the right half of the dungeon view.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>In Dungeon Master go to map 0 at coordinates 6,16 and face west.</li>
<li>Move backward 2 or 3 steps.</li>
<li>Cast a low power Fireball spell and immediately move one step to the right.</li>
<li>When the projectile impacts the wall, the Fireball explosion may be drawn incorrectly, here are some examples where the bitmap looks cropped on the right side:<br/>

<h3><a name="BUG0_07">BUG0_07</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Graphical glitch when drawing explosions.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>If an explosion bitmap is cropped because it is only partly visible on the left side of the viewport and the bitmap is not flipped horizontally then a variable is not set before being used. Its previous value (defined while drawing something else) is used and may cause an incorrect bitmap to be drawn.<br/>
How to reproduce:<br/>
<ol><li>In Dungeon Master go to map 0 at coordinates 6,16 and face west.</li>
<li>Move backward 2 or 3 steps.</li>
<li>Cast a Fireball spell and immediately move one step to the right.</li>

<h3><a name="BUG0_08">BUG0_08</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Objects disappear in the dungeon and data is corrupted in memory.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The game manages an array of limited size containing the first thing on each square where there is at least one thing. There is no check to stop adding things to this array when it is full and this causes data corruptions in memory. With the original Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes back dungeons the array is large enough so that most players will not get into trouble, however it is still possible to fill it by placing one thing on as many squares as possible in the dungeon. The number of free slots to store first square things is 676 in DM for Atari ST 1.0a EN, 678 in DM for Atari ST 1.0b EN, 679 in DM for Atari ST 1.1 EN, 1.2 EN, 1.2 GE, 1.3a FR and 1.3b FR, 690 in CSB for Atari ST 2.0 EN and 2.1 EN (each dungeon contains a number of free slots and the game adds 300 more when loading the dungeon).<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Collect all objects present in the dungeon and spread them on as many squares as possible. Do not place objects on squares where there is already a thing (doors, teleporters, floor sensors).</li>
<li>Do not use Ven Potions and Ful Potions because there is no way to create potions in the game.</li>
<li>Kill lots of groups so they drop new objects and place each object on a distinct square in the dungeon. You must repeat this operation with various types of creatures in order to create objects of each type (weapon, armor, junk) and until the groups do not drop objects anymore (meaning the maximum possible number of objects of each kind is reached).</li>
<li>Generate as many groups as possible (and do not kill them) on multiple maps in order to maximize their total number in the dungeon.</li>
<li>When there are too many squares with things on them, the things on the last squares with at least one thing in the dungeon start to disappear.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_09">BUG0_09</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>The game may trigger a sensor and cause an undesired effect when discarding a thing from a square.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>When the game needs to create a new thing but has run out of storage for the corresponding thing type (for example when creating a Screamer Slice after a Screamer is killed) it will try to remove another thing of the same type elsewhere in the dungeon (except things that are explicitly marked as non discardable). If the square where the thing is removed contains a sensor, it may be triggered and cause an undesired effect. For example, discarding a Screamer Slice placed by the player on a pressure plate on the floor may close a door or open a pit which may block the party.<br/>
This issue is hard to reproduce because of all the conditions to meet.</dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_10">BUG0_10</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>No perceptible symptom when playing the game. Coding error without consequence.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The game reserves a pool of 3 things to make sure it can create 'Bones' objects for dead champions in the party. When the game creates a thing for a dead champion's bones then Bit 15 is set in the requested thing type to indicate that the pool of reserved things can be used. This bit is not cleared before using the thing type as an array index. No consequence because the machine code generated by the Megamax C compiler left shifts the 16 bits value by 1 bit and then keeps the least significant 16 bits, effectively truncating the original and unwanted bit 15. With other compilers or other platforms this may cause an out of bounds array index issue.</dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_11">BUG0_11</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Data corruption in memory.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Each group located on the same map as the party has additional associated data but there is only provision for 60 instances. If there are more groups at the same time then some of them do not get their instance and when the game accesses this information it will corrupt other data in memory (either the instance of another group, parts of the timeline or events). This situation cannot occur in the original Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes Back dungeons for the following reasons (but it may occur in custom dungeons if they are not designed carefully): there is no map with already more than 60 groups in the original dungeons and none of the following 3 possible ways to move a group into a map can increase the number of instances above the maximum of 60:
<ul><li>A group generator sensor is triggered: the game never generates a group on the party map if there are less than 5 instances available. This limits the actual number of groups on a map to 55 in most cases.</li>
<li>A group falls through a pit from the map above (the creature type must be allowed on the target map): a group will never willingly move to an open pit square. It may move to a closed pit square and fall if the pit is then open (either automatically or triggered by the party on the map below). There are no such pits in the original dungeons.</li>
<li>A group is teleported from another map (the creature type must be allowed on the target map): in the original dungeons, all teleporters whose scope include groups and target another map are either inaccessible to groups or the groups are not allowed on the target map. The only exception is for some Gigglers in the Chaos Strikes Back dungeon but there are not enough to use the 5 reserved instances.</li></ul>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Create a custom dungeon.</li>
<li>Place more than 60 groups on the same map.</li>
<li>Alternatively, place teleporters and/or blinking pits that can move groups to a target map where there are already many groups. The creature type must be allowed on the target map. You can also place a group generator sensor on the source map to create up to 55 groups on the map.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_12">BUG0_12</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>An object is cloned and appears at two different locations in the dungeon and/or inventory. The game may crash when interacting with this object.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>If a Giggler with no possessions steals an object that was previously in a chest and was not the last object in the chest then the objects that followed it are cloned. In the chest, the object is part of a linked list of objects that is not reset when the object is removed from the chest and placed in the inventory (but not in the dungeon), nor when it is stolen and added as the first Giggler possession. If the Giggler already has a possession before stealing the object then this does not create a cloned object.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Open a chest containing several objects.</li>
<li>Take one object that is not the last object in the chest and place it in the ready hand.</li>
<li>Face a Giggler until it steals the object from the ready hand. If this is the first object that the Giggler steals, then he actually steals the object and the objects that followed it in the chest, which are now cloned: they are referenced both in the Chest and in the Giggler possessions.</li>
<li>Kill the Giggler. The stolen object and the cloned objects are dropped on the floor. Cloned objects may crash the game and create other undesired effects.</li>
<li>Place additional objects on the floor on top of the cloned objects. They will be linked to these objects which are also in the chest, which can result to a chest containing more than 8 objects. Open the inventory of a champion and place the chest in the action hand. Before version CSB for Atari ST 2.1 EN, this will cause graphical glitches and corrupt some memory as the game tries to display the additional objects:<br/>

<dt>Resolution</dt>
<dd>Improperly fixed in CSB for Atari ST 2.1 EN, never fully fixed. The developers were aware of a cloning issue, but it looks like they thought it was related to opening an already open chest or closing an already closed chest so they became paranoid regarding chest management code and made changes that actually have no useful effect (see <a href="#CHANGE8_09_FIX">CHANGE8_09_FIX</a>) and even reintroduced <a href="#BUG0_48">BUG0_48</a> that was fixed previously in CSB for Atari ST 2.0 EN (see <a href="#CHANGE7_27_FIX">CHANGE7_27_FIX</a>). However, although the actual bug itself was not fixed, changes were made to fix some of its consequences:

<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>The game may crash when Lord Order or Grey Lord cast spells. This cannot happen with the original dungeons as they do not contain any groups of these types.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Lord Order and Grey Lord creatures can cast spells (attack range > 1) but no projectile type is defined for them in the code. If these creatures are present in a dungeon they will cast projectiles containing undefined things because the variable is not initialized.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Create a custom dungeon and place a 'Lord Order' or 'Grey Lord' group.</li>
<li>When playing the game, move close to the group. It will cast random projectiles to the party and this may crash the game.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_14">BUG0_14</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>While life is frozen, creature reaction events are not ignored as they should. They accumulate and can saturate the timeline.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Creature reactions happen after seeing another creature in the group die, being hit by a projectile or a closing door and attacked or bumped into by the party. Each reaction creates an additional event in the timeline and these events are not removed from the timeline while life is frozen by using a Magical Box (except for Lord Chaos which is immune). When events are exhausted, new events are not added to the timeline which can cause many issues (see <a href="#BUG0_18">BUG0_18</a>).<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Collect as many Magical Box (Green) as possible.</li>
<li>Face a creature and use one Magical Box to Freeze Life.</li>
<li>Keep bumping into the creature and periodically use other Magical Boxes to keep life frozen. Each time you bump into the creature, an additional reaction event is added to the timeline.</li>
<li>If the timeline is full then new events are not created anymore. See <a href="#BUG0_18">BUG0_18</a> for possible consequences.
Note: the maximum number of events in the timeline is 463 (in DM for Atari ST 1.0a EN and 1.0b EN) or 467 (in DM for Atari ST 1.1 EN).</li></ol></dd>

<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>If the game cannot create a projectile thing because it has run out of such things (60 maximum) then the object being thrown/shot/launched is orphaned.

The issue does not occur in the original Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes Back dungeons.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Create a custom dungeon.</li>
<li>Create a loop with 4 teleporters that only turn things in-place so that the projectiles will never impact on a wall and will perpetually move around.</li>
<li>Next to one of the teleporters, place a projectile launcher sensor. Place another wall sensor that the party can use to trigger the projectile launcher.</li>

<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Projectile launcher sensors have a step energy value defining how much kinetic energy is consumed with each step of movement of the projectiles they create.

<h3><a name="BUG0_22">BUG0_22</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>When a teleporter or pit opens, the game hangs or some things are not moved correctly.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The program enters an infinite loop if there are at least two things on a closed teleporter or closed pit square and these things end up on the same square when the teleporter or pit opens. This occurs in these cases:
<ul><li>On a teleporter square targetting itself if there are at least two things on the square when the teleporter is opened.</li>
<li>On a pit square if there are at least two things levitating over the pit (two projectiles or one group and one projectile) when the pit is opened.</li></ul>
Some things are not moved correctly if the list of things on the square contains a group followed by a projectile that impacts the group and then other things. When the group is processed, the projectile is removed from the list of things on the square, which breaks the loop and the next things in the list are not processed.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>In Dungeon Master, go to map 7 at coordinates 28,13.</li>
<li>Press the button to open the wall at coordinates 29,12, revealing a second button that controls the teleporter at coordinates 29,13.</li>

<h3><a name="BUG0_23">BUG0_23</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>A Fluxcage explosion remains on a square forever.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>If you open a pit or teleporter on a square where there is a Fluxcage explosion, the Fluxcage explosion is moved but the associated event is not updated (because Fluxcage explosions do not use the same event type as all other explosions) causing the Fluxcage explosion to remain in the dungeon forever on its destination square. When the event expires the explosion thing is not removed, but it is marked as unused. Consequently, any objects placed on the Fluxcage square after it was moved but before it expires become orphans upon expiration. After expiration, any object placed on the fluxcage square is cloned when picked up.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>In Dungeon Master, go to map 2 at coordinates 09,38 where there is a blinking teleporter.</li>
<li>Use the Firestaff to place a Fluxcage on the teleporter square. The teleporter moves the Fluxcage to coordinates 15,38.</li>
<li>Place one or more objects on the square at 15,38. Note that you can pick up objects normally on that square.</li>
<li>Wait for the Fluxcage event to expire, at which point the objects on the floor disappear and become orphans. The Fluxcage is not removed from the square.</li>
<li>Place an object on the Fluxcage square, then pick up that object. It is not removed from the square and can be picked up multiple times, creating clones. Manipulating cloned things can crash the game.</li></ol></dd>

<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>An explosion can trigger a floor sensor.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Explosions do not trigger floor sensors on the square where they are created. However, if an explosion is moved by a teleporter (or by falling into a pit, see <a href="#BUG0_26">BUG0_26</a>) after it was created, it can trigger floor sensors on the destination square. This is because explosions are not considered as levitating in the code, while projectiles are.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>In Chaos Strikes Back, go to map 2 at coordinates 20,10.</li>
<li>Face north and cast a high power poison cloud spell so that it will last as long as possible. When the explosion is created on the square at 20,9, the floor sensor is not triggered.</li>
<li>Turn around to face south and move one step backward into the poison cloud. The party triggers the floor sensor there which opens an invisible teleporter on the same square, moving the party and the explosion to coordinates 19,11.</li>
<li>Immediately after this teleportation, move one step to the right so that the party is not teleported anymore. The explosion can be seen moving in the corridor, teleported from one square to the next because the explosion itself triggers the floor sensors on each square. If you move one step back to the left you can even 'follow' the explosion in the corridor.</li></ol></dd>

<dd>The condition to determine if the sensor should be triggered checks if there is a creature on the square but does not check whether the creature is levitating.

<dd>If you quickly move the mouse pointer over the action area where the action icon for the candidate champion will be drawn after clicking on a portrait and before the inventory is drawn on screen then there may be a graphical glitch where the mouse pointer erases a part of the action icon with a black rectangle in the action area 'behind' the mouse pointer. This is because the mouse pointer is not hidden while drawing the action icon. When the mouse pointer is moved over the action area, it captures the black pixels behind the pointer. The action icon is drawn and when the inventory is open, the mouse cursor is hidden which causes the captured black pixels to replace part of the action icon.<br/>

<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>A champion icon may be missing in the upper right corner of the screen after loading a saved game where at least one champion is dead.<br/>
Example where the green champion icon is missing:<br/>
<img src="IMAGES/BUG0_36.png" alt=""/></dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>When a dead champion is reborn at a Vi Altar, the champion cell is set to the first available cell where there is no champion alive. It is then possible that the cell of the reborn champion is the same as the cell of another dead champion in the party. If the index of the dead champion is higher than the index of the reborn champion and the game is saved then when restarting the game from the saved game the icon of the reborn champion will not appear on screen. This is only a graphic glitch and you only need to click on the black area where the missing icon should be to make it appear again. When the game is loaded, the state of each champion is drawn. For a dead champion, this erases the champion icon according to the cell of the dead champion, even if another champion is at the same cell.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Start a new game and reincarnate or resurrect 3 champions.</li>
<li>Kill the first champion.</li>
<li>In the top right corner of the screen, move the icon of the second champion to the location previously occupied by the first champion icon.</li>
<li>Kill the second champion.</li>
<li>Bring the first champion back to life at a Vi Altar. The icon will take the cell previously occupied by the second champion. Both the first (alive) and second (dead) champions now refer to the same cell in the party.</li>

<h3><a name="BUG0_37">BUG0_37</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>The contents of a chest are refreshed when grabbing or putting a Rabbit's Foot anywhere in the inventory. An object in a chest may disappear when grabbing a Rabbit's Foot from a chest. A champion may have a permanent bonus or malus to the (hidden) Luck statistic.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The Luck modifier of the Rabbit's Foot is applied when it is inside a container while it should not. This causes the following issues:
<ul><li>If a chest is open then each time you grab or put a Rabbit's Foot anywhere in the inventory the chest contents are drawn again in the panel. If there are empty slots in the chest then objects are reorganized so they occupy the first slots of the chest.</li>
<li>If there is an object in the leader hand when grabbing a Rabbit's Foot from a chest then the next object in the chest disappears and becomes an orphan.</li>
<li>When a champion puts a Rabbit's Foot in a chest, that champion's Luck is increased. When a champion removes a Rabbit's Foot from a chest, that champion's Luck is decreased. If you move a chest containing a Rabbit's Foot from one champion to another between these two operations, then the first champion keeps a permanent Luck bonus and the second champion has no bonus for possessing a Rabbit's Foot and will even get a malus when removing it from the chest.</li></ul>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Open a chest containing at least two objects and move objects in the chest so that there is at least an empty slot followed by at least one object.</li>
<li>Grab a Rabbit's Foot from any other location in the inventory. The chest contents are immediately reorganized so that there are no empty slots between objects.</li>
<li>Click on the object in the first slot in the chest to swap the Rabbit's Foot in the leader hand and the first object in the chest. Take note of the object that follows the Rabbit's Foot in the chest.</li>
<li>Click again on the Rabbit's Foot to swap it with the object in the leader hand. The object that followed the Rabbit's Foot in the chest disappears.</li>
<li>Put the Rabbit's Foot in the chest (this gives a Luck bonus to the champion) and close the chest.</li>
<li>Move the chest to another champion, open his inventory, remove the Rabbit's Foot from the chest and put it in the dungeon. The first champion now has a permanent Luck bonus (although he does not possess a Rabbit's Foot anymore) and the second champion has a permanent Luck malus. This cannot be seen in the game but can be seen by decoding a saved game.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_38">BUG0_38</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>A champion is much luckier than expected during combat when equipped with at least 4 cursed objects.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Champion statistic values are stored as one byte unsigned integers which can store values between 0 to 255. Each champion has a minimum, a maximum and a current value for each of the statistics. When an object modifier is applied to a statistic, all three values are modified but there is no check to make sure the new values stay in the bounds of 0 to 255. This is not an issue in most cases because nearly all modifiers are positive and with relatively small values so that any combination of champion statistic value with these modifiers will result in valid values. The only issue is with the hidden luck statistic and the modifier for cursed objects which is the only negative modifier in the game (-3). The minimum luck value for all champions is set to 10 at the beginning of the game and is only changed by object modifiers. If enough cursed objects are equipped (between 4 and 6) then the minimum value 'wraps around' and becomes a large value (254 with 4 cursed objects, 251 with 5 cursed objects and 248 with 6 cursed objects). The first time that the luck of the champion is tested after the cursed objects are equipped, the current luck value is set to its minimum value (248, 251 or 254) because the game detects that the current value is smaller than the minimum allowed. During the following luck tests:
<ul><li>If the test succeeds, the current luck is decreased by 2 and then bounded between the minimum and maximum values. The current value is then smaller than the minimum value so the current luck value is set to its minimum value (248, 251 or 254).</li>
<li>If the test fails, the current luck is increased by 2 and then bounded between the minimum and maximum values. The current value is then larger than the minimum value, however it is larger than the maximum value so the current value is set to its maximum value. During the next luck test, the current value will again be smaller than the minimum and be reset to the minimum value.</li></ul>
As a consequence, while the cursed objects are equipped, the current luck value can only have two possible values: either its maximum value, or its minimum value (which is even larger at 248, 251 or 254) so the champion is always luckier than he should be.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>In the game, kill an Animated Armour/Deth Knight and collect the 6 cursed objects dropped (4 pieces or armor and 2 weapons).</li>
<li>Equip the four pieces of armor and place the weapons in both hands of a single champion. Make sure the champion does not have a Rabbit's Foot in his inventory which would add 10 to his luck statistic.</li>
<li>The luck of the champion is modified by 6 * -3 = -18. The minimum value for luck is now set to 248.</li>
<li>From now on, each test of the champion's luck will have a higher probability of success (it may still fail because of the random nature of the test). Luck is tested when a creature attacks a champion, when a champion attacks a creature and when a Giggler tries to steal objects from action hands. During combat, the champion will hit creatures more frequently and be hit by creatures less frequently.</li></ol></dd>

<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>In the leader inventory, the Food/Water/Poisoned panel is briefly drawn when replacing a scroll or chest by another scroll or chest in the action hand. This does not occur for champions other than the leader.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>When swapping the objects between the action hand and the leader hand, the program first removes the object in the action hand. If the removed object is a chest or a scroll then this sets a flag in the champion data to refresh the panel. Then the object in the leader hand is removed. The weight of the object in the leader hand is part of the load of the leader, so this sets another flag in the champion data of the leader to refresh the Load value and then calls the function to draw the leader champion state. If the champion is not the leader, nothing is drawn. If the champion is the leader, the Food/Water/Poisoned panel is drawn because at this point the action hand is empty. Then the object that was removed from the leader hand is put in the action hand and this draws the panel again, this time showing the chest contents or scroll text.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Open the inventory of the leader.</li>
<li>Put a chest or scroll in the action hand.</li>
<li>Grab another chest or scroll and replace the one in the action hand.</li>
<li>The Food/Water/Poisoned panel is briefly drawn before the panel is updated to show the chest contents or the scroll.</li>

<dd>The Antifire and Antimagic statistics are completely ignored. The Vitality statistic is ignored against poison and to determine the probability of being wounded. Vitality is still used normally to compute the defense against wounds and the speed of health regeneration.</dd>

<dd>The Megamax C compiler used to develop the game contains a bug that produces wrong machine code for the function that adjusts an attack value based on the value of a champion statistic.

<li>Face a wall and cast multiple fireballs of a given power.</li>

<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Some keyboard commands (Freeze Game, Unfreeze Game, Save game) should be ignored but are not when pressing the eye or mouth.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Open a champion inventory and either click on the eye, or place a chest or scroll in the action hand and then click on the mouth.</li>
<li>While still pressing on the eye or mouth with the mouse, perform one of the following steps:
<ol><li>Press the CTRL-S key combination on the keyboard to open the save game dialog then release the mouse button. When the save game dialog is drawn, the mouse pointer is not visible but it is still possible to move the invisible pointer over a dialog choice and click.</li>
<li>Press the Escape key on the keyboard to freeze the game then release the mouse button. The panel is drawn over the freeze game screen. If you press Escape another time or click a mouse button the inventory is redrawn correctly.<br/><img src="IMAGES/BUG0_52_1.png" alt=""/></li>
<li>Press the Escape key on the keyboard a first time to freeze the game and then a second time to unfreeze the game. The dungeon view is drawn. Release the mouse button and then the panel is briefly drawn over the dungeon view.<br/><img src="IMAGES/BUG0_52_2.png" alt=""/><br/>If you do not move the mouse and click again then the panel is drawn again as if you clicked on the eye but the panel content is incoherent. If you click the right mouse button to toggle inventory another graphical glitch occurs: the status box of a "fifth" champion is drawn over the champion icons in the top right corner of the screen, and overwrites parts of the leftmost champion status box. Crashes may occurs during these manipulations.<br/><img src="IMAGES/BUG0_52_3.png" alt=""/></li>

<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>The defense modifier of an action is permanent.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Each action has an associated defense modifier value and a number of ticks while the champion cannot perform another action because the action icon is grayed out. If an action has a non zero defense modifier and a zero value for the number of ticks then the defense modifier is applied but it is never removed. This causes no issue in the original games because there are no actions in this case but it may occur in a version where data is customized.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Customize game data so that one action has a non zero defense modifier and a number of ticks set to zero.</li>
<li>Perform the action multiple times. The defense modifier is applied multiple times to the champion and remains permanently. From now on, defense against creature attacks is much more efficient.</li></ol></dd>

<dd>The game stops with message 'SYSTEM ERROR 60' right after restarting from a saved game.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The game manages a watchdog event to detect issues with the timeline processing. Each time the watchdog event expires, a new watchdog event is scheduled to occur 300 ticks later. If at any point the watchdog event time is in the past compared to the current game time then the game is stopped with the error message. The issue is that the watchdog event time is not reset when restarting from a saved game so if you restore a game where the current time is in the future compared to the watchdog time then the game stops.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Start a new game and save the game on floppy A.</li>
<li>Wait for 5 minutes and save the game again on floppy B.</li>
<li>Boot the game and resume the game from floppy A, then wait for 2 minutes.</li>

<dd>A group that is not on the party map may wrongly move or not move into a teleporter.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>Normally, a creature type with Wariness >= 10 (Vexirk, Materializer / Zytaz, Demon, Lord Chaos, Red Dragon / Dragon) would only move into a teleporter if the creature type is allowed on the destination map. However a variable identifying the group is not set before being used so the check to see if the creature type is allowed may operate on another creature type and thus return an incorrect result, causing the creature to teleport while it should not, or not to teleport while it should.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Create a custom dungeon. Place a dragon on a map behind a teleporter targeting another map where dragons are not allowed.</li>
<li>Place other creatures like Gigglers that are allowed on both the same map as the dragon and the destination map of the teleporter.</li>
<li>Play the game and go to the map where the dragon is located so it that starts moving (groups do not move until you enter their map for the first time). As long as you stay on the same map as the dragon, it will never enter the teleporter.</li>

<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Memory corruption when you close a door on Lord Chaos.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The local variable containing the direction where Lord Chaos tries to move may be used as an array index without being initialized and cause memory corruption.<br/>
This bug can only be triggered in versions 1.2 and 1.3 because <a href="#BUG0_15">BUG0_15</a> hangs the game in earlier versions. The actual consequences depend on the value of the uninitialized local variable.<br/>
How to reproduce:

<dd>A projectile impact on a creature may be ignored.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The function to detect projectile impacts when a quarter square sized creature moves inside a group (to another cell on the same square) may fail if there are several creatures in the group because of an incorrect parameter value.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Face a group of three mummies where two mummies are on the back and one is on the front.</li>
<li>Throw an object or cast a spell on the side where there is only one mummy in the back.</li>
<li>If the mummy on that side moves to the front cell of the square at the appropriate time when the projectile is on the same square then the projectile moves through the creature and does not impact. You may have to try several times until the issue occurs.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_72">BUG0_72</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>The party moves very slowly even though no champion 'Load' value is drawn in red.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>When the Load of a champion has exactly the maximum value he can carry then the Load is drawn in yellow but the speed is the same as when the champion is overloaded (when the Load is drawn in red).<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Make sure the Load values of all champions are drawn in gray. Drop objects if necessary.</li>
<li>Place as much objects as necessary in the inventory of a champion until the Load value is drawn in red.</li>
<li>Remove small objects weighing 0.1 Kg from the inventory until the Load value is drawn in yellow. This is the maximum value that the champion can carry without being overloaded.</li>
<li>Move the party. The movement speed is the same as if the party was overloaded but the Load color is not red.</li>

<h3><a name="BUG0_73">BUG0_73</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>A mouse click may be ignored.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>A mouse command may be overwritten by a keyboard command in the command queue before being processed. The game can queue up to 4 mouse and keyboard commands and uses a semaphore to prevent concurrent accesses to the command queue data. However, the semaphore is a 2 bytes value. When regular functions manipulate the command queue, a flag is set in the least significant byte. When a mouse click occurs, this triggers and interrupt but the code checks and sets a flag in the most significant byte, thus ignoring any flag set in the other byte. Normally, if the command queue is locked, the program should buffer the mouse click in dedicated global variables until the command queue is available again. Because of the bug, the buffering is actually never used.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Press the down arrow key on the keyboard to input a command.</li>
<li>Click the left mouse button while the pointer is over the forward arrow to input another command.</li>
<li>With the appropriate timing between these two operations (extremely difficult to achieve on purpose), the mouse click will be ignored.</li></ol></dd>

<h3><a name="BUG0_74">BUG0_74</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Creatures are drawn with wrong colors when viewed through a wall with the 'Thieve's Eye' spell.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>In order to produce the visual effect of the spell, the engine has to compose several graphics. The game first captures a portion of what is visible behind the wall in a temporary location and then draws the 'hole in wall' graphic over it using transparency for the inner color, which is color 10 (at the center of the 'hole in wall' graphic):<br/>
<img src="IMAGES/BUG0_74_1.png" alt=""/><br/>
Next, it draws the wall in front of the party (overwriting what was previously visible). Finally it draws the graphic from the temporary location using transparency for the outer color, which is color 9 (in the corners of the 'hole in wall' graphic). However, color 9 may be used by creature graphics that are now visible in the center part of the graphic. Consequently, all creature graphic pixels using color 9 will not be drawn during this last operation and the pixels from the background wall will be visible instead, giving creatures a strange appeareance with wrong grey/white colors.<br/>
The bug is only visible with creature graphics that use color 9: Giant Scorpion / Scorpion, Swamp Slime / Slime Devil, Wizard Eye / Flying Eye, Pain Rat, Ruster, Magenta Worm / Worm, Trolin / Ant Man, Materializer / Zytaz (except the back graphic), Water Elemental, Oitu, Demon, Lord Chaos (except the back graphic), Red Dragon / Dragon, Lord Order, Grey Lord. There is no bug when viewing through a door.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>In Dungeon Master go to map 2 at coordinates 26,34 and face west.</li>
<li>Cast a 'Thieve's Eye' spell.</li>
<li>Wait until Trolins move in front of the hole in the wall.</li>

<h3><a name="BUG0_75">BUG0_75</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Multiple champion portraits are drawn (one at a time) then the game crashes.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>The global variable storing the champion portrait to draw is only reset when at least one square in the dungeon view is a wall. If the party is in front of a wall with a champion portrait and the next time the dungeon view is drawn there is no wall square in the view and the square in front of the party is a fake wall with a random ornament then the same champion portrait will be drawn again because the variable was not reset. A different portait is drawn each time the dungeon view is refreshed until the game crashes.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>Create a custom dungeon.</li>
<li>Place a teleporter one square away from a wall with a champion portrait. The teleporter should move the party to a location with a fake wall right in front and no walls on all other squares visible in the dungeon view. The fake wall must allow random ornaments.</li>
<li>In the game, move to face the portrait on the wall.</li>
<li>Move one step backward. The party is teleported in front of the fake wall. A champion portrait is still visible (without the mirror) and is changed for each refresh of the dungeon view until the game crashes:<br/><img src="IMAGES/BUG0_75.png" alt=""/></li></ol></dd>

<dd>The closed scroll icon is drawn when the scroll is open.</dd>

<h3><a name="BUG7_01">BUG7_01</a></h3>
<dl><dt>Symptom</dt>
<dd>Some creatures may be drawn with unexpected colors in Chaos Strikes Back.</dd>
<dt>Cause</dt>
<dd>In the color palettes used to draw the dungeon view, two colors (9 and 10) are only used by creature graphics and each creature type can specify replacement colors to use instead of the default colors. Creature types that do not use these colors can specify that no replacement is needed. Each map in the dungeon has an associated list of allowed creature types. If multiple creatures with conflicting color replacements are allowed on the same map then each replacement color is defined by the creature type that appears the last in the list of allowed creature types. There are such conflicts in Chaos Strikes Back for 'Worm' which are never drawn with their 'true' colors.<br/>
All bitmaps for 'Slime Devil' use both colors 9 and 10 but replacement is only specified for color 10. On the map where this creature is used, there are no other creatures defining color 9 so the default color is used which is appropriate. However, this color should be explicitly specified.<br/>
The front, side and attack bitmaps for 'Lord Chaos' use both colors 9 and 10 but no replacements are specified. On the map where this creature is used, the colors defined by the Demon are used, which are also appropriate for Lord Chaos. However, these colors should be explicitly specified.<br/>
All bitmaps for 'Hellhound' do not use colors 9 and 10 but it specifies replacements for both, inherited from 'Pain Rat' (DM). On the map where this creature is used, none of the creatures use colors 9 and 10 so this has no consequence. However, these colors should not be specified.<br/>
All bitmaps for 'Worm' use both colors 9 and 10 and specify replacements for both colors 9 and 10 but these replacements are still for 'Magenta Worm' (DM). In the game, the actual colors used are not the same on all maps where they are present: on map 0 the colors are defined by 'Demon', on map 9 the colors are defined by 'Dragon' (same colors as 'Demon') and on map 4 color 9 is defined by 'Giant Scorpion' and color 10 is defined by 'Flying Eye'.<br/>
The front, side and attack bitmaps for 'Zytaz' use both colors 9 and 10 and specify replacements for both colors 9 and 10 but the replacements are still for the 'Materializer' (DM). They appear with other (and correct) colors in the game only because they were defined by 'Demon'. However, these colors should be explicitly specified.<br/>
How to reproduce:
<ol><li>For 'Worm', create a custom dungeon, add this creature as the last allowed creature type on a map. When playing the game, they will be drawn with the wrong colors that it specifies.<br/>
The Worm is the only creature that is intended to be drawn with different colors on different maps (the creature was redrawn compared to worms in Dungeon Master). In Chaos Strikes Back go to maps 0, 4 and 9 to see that their colors are different on each map:<br/>
<img src="IMAGES/BUG7_01_1.png" alt=""/> <img src="IMAGES/BUG7_01_2.png" alt=""/> <img src="IMAGES/BUG7_01_3.png" alt=""/></li>
<li>For 'Slime Devil' and 'Lord Chaos' create a custom dungeon, add a creature that replaces colors 9 and 10 and then add one of these creature in the list of allowed creatures. When playing the game, the colors of the first creature will be used instead of the expected colors.</li>
<li>For 'Hellhound', create a custom dungeon, add other creatures that use colors 9 or 10 before it in the list of allowed creature types. When playing the game, the other creatures will be drawn with the replacement colors defined by 'Hellhound'.</li>
<li>For 'Zytaz', create a custom dungeon, add this creature as the last allowed creature type on a map. When playing the game, they will be drawn with the wrong colors that it specifies.</li></ol></dd>
