     Window  Term is a terminal program in a desk  accessory.   It 
differs  from  the  VT52 emulator in one major way  -  it's  in  a 
window.  This means that you can keep it on the screen while doing 
other things - For example, you could open Window Term while using 
a word processor, and switch between your document and Window Term 
- both will be on the screen.   If you've used the Control  Panel, 
Window  Term  is similar to that.   It is a GEM  window  like  any 
other.

     Window  Term  represents a lot  of  work.   However,  in  the 
interest of getting this program to as many people as possible,  I 
have made it completely public domain.   It may be distributed  in 
any way.   My only request is that if you modify the source  code, 
please  get  a copy of the modified source code to me.

INTRODUCTION
------------

     Window  Term comes in two versions (both are included in  the 
distribution  archive).   The  Stripped  version  is  smaller  and 
faster,  but  has almost no features.   You must use  an  external 
program  to  set the RS232 port when using the  Stripped  version.  
The  Full  version is bigger and slower,  but  has  many  features 
discussed in detail below.  It's helpful to read the documentation 
for both before you decide which is best for you.

     To install the Stripped version, just copy the file WTERM.ACC 
to  the root directory of a floppy or hard disk.   When  you  boot 
with  that disk,  it will be listed in the 'Desk' menu  as  Window 
Term.

     To  install the Full version,  copy the files WTERMF.ACC  and 
WTERMF.RSC  to the root directory of a floppy or hard  disk.   The 
Full version is listed in the Desk menu as Window Terminal.




Stripped Version
----------------

     The stripped version, as mentioned above, is much smaller and 
slightly faster than the full version.   There are two versions of 
window term in order to maintain as much flexibility as  possible.  
Note  that  with the Stripped version,  you must use  an  external 
program  (such as the Install RS232 desk accessory or  a  terminal 
program) to set the RS232 parameters.
     When  you  click on Window Term,  a window will open  on  the 
screen  with  the title 'Window Term' (there may be  some  version 
information in the title also).   This is a full GEM window -  you 
can move it,  size it, full it, close it, and select it, just like 
any other window.   When the window is active,  anything you  type 
will be sent to the RS232 port, and anything coming from the RS232 
port will be displayed in the window.   Text will wrap at the  end 
of a line and scroll just as in a text screen.
     There are two special keys you should be aware of when  using 
the stripped version - ALT-F toggles between the normal text  font 
and the small 'icon' font (the same font that's used for the names 
of icons).   ALT-S stops the text immediately.   This is necessary 
because  the  terminal  is  sometimes  slower  than  the  incoming 
characters,  and will keep printing backed-up characters after you 
send  a CTRL-S to the remote computer.   ALT-S sends a CTRL-S  and 
will  not  accept any incoming characters until  you  press  ALT-S 
again.
     Click  on  the Window Term entry in the desk menu  while  the 
window is open for more information.
     When the window is deselected (another window is made active), 
Window  Term  will send a CTRL-S to the RS232 port.   When  it  is 
reselected, it will send a CTRL-Q.



Full Version
------------

     The  Full  version  is larger and slower  than  the  stripped 
version,  but has many extra features.   It takes up about 40K  of 
memory, while the stripped version take up about 15K.
     The Full version has all the features of the stripped version 
except  the  ALT-F command (which is replaced by a  more  flexible 
function  of the same sort).   In addition,  it has the  following 
features:

-Ability to set RS232 parameters,  similar to the 'Install  RS232' 
desk accessory

-Ability  to change the font to any of three sizes (two  sizes  in 
color)

-An optional cursor

-Allows the user to set the size of the RS232 buffer

-Ability  to save all of the above parameters and the  coordinates 
and size of the window to disk

     Each  of these features are discussed in  detail  below.   To 
access  them,  click  on the 'Window Terminal' entry in  the  Desk 
menu while the window is open.  You will be presented with a menu.  
Click  on  the option you wish to use.   Each of the  options  are 
discussed below.

     About  Window Term gives some information about  the  program 
and credit to the author.

     Set RS232 Parameters allows you to set the Baud Rate, Parity, 
Word   Length,    and   other   RS232   parameters.    It's   very 
straightforward - just select the parameters you want active,  and 
click on the OK button.   If you do not want to set the parameters 
after all, click on the CANCEL button.

     Set RS232 Buffer Size allows you to set the size of the RS232 
buffer.   The higher your baud rate,  the bigger the RS232  buffer 
should be.   I find that 16K is usually more than enough for  1200 
baud.   This program has not been tested with 2400 baud or higher; 
please  let me know if there are any problems with  that.   If  in 
doubt, though, make the RS232 buffer bigger.

     Set Character Size allows you to select any of the ST's three 
character sets - the 'monochrome font', which is the character set 
used with the monochrome monitor normally, the 'color font', which 
is the character set normally used with the color monitor, and the 
'icon  font',  which is the tiny font used at the bottom  of  most 
icons.   Using the icon font,  you can get a full 80 columns by 24 
lines in a relatively small window.

     Cursor  on/off lets you select or deselect the  cursor.   The 
cursor  is useful when editing lines and such,  but it slows  down 
the  terminal quite a bit.   Note that backspaces are  destructive 
when  you are not using the cursor,  and non-destructive when  the 
cursor  is  active.   I don't recommend using  the  cursor  unless 
absolutely necessary.

     Save settings saves all the above parameters and the position 
and  size of the window to a file called WTERMF.INF in  your  root 
directory.   The  full version of Window Terminal will attempt  to 
read this file whenever it is booted.   If it can't it sets up the 
default parameters.

     Cancel cancels the menu.



Notes and Program Revisions
---------------------------

     Thanks  to Rick Flashman,  who beta tested this  and  offered 
many valuable suggestions.

     This  program  was  developed using the  Megamax  C  Language 
Development System, K-Resource, and the Gulam shell.

     Version  1.0  - released 8/2/87 - first  version.   No  known 
bugs.  Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't any!
