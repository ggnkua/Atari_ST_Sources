          HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL

          The documentation for BinkleyTerm is supplied in two parts.

          The User's Guide (named BT_USER.DOC) explains how to install
          BinkleyTerm.  It also describes basic operational procedures.  New
          users may find some concepts or terminology unfamiliar; a glossary
          is provided toward the end of the User's Guide.

          Concepts and terminology that may be of interest to experienced
          users and new users alike are covered in the Reference Guide (named
          BT_REF.DOC) an alphabetically arranged manual separate from the
          User's Guide.

          For inquiries, questions or comments regarding BinkleyTerm, please
          refer to the User's Guide section "BinkleyTerm Support."

          CONFIGURATION FILE

          The BinkleyTerm configuration file, by default named BINKLEY.CFG,
          is the place where you communicate information about your system to
          BinkleyTerm.  Modem control strings, FidoNet node addresses,
          and much more are all contained in the configuration file.
          A sample configuration file comes with the BinkleyTerm
          distribution package.  The sample file is arranged in such a way
          as to illustrate which parameters need to be changed for which
          operational modes.  For ease of use as a reference, the parameters
          are listed alphabetically here.

          About <filespec>

               This tells BinkleyTerm the name of the ABOUT file, a special
               file used with incoming file requests.  <filespec> is a
               complete drive, path and filename designation.  Refer to the
               User's Guide sections "File Requests" and "Security -
               Controlling File Requests" for more information.

          Address [<zone>:]<net>/<node>[.<point>][@domain] [fakenet] [bossphone]

               This statement (or multiple statements) designates the network
               address(es) of your system.  Although the <zone> and <point>
               parameters are optional, it is recommended that the <zone>
               parameter ALWAYS be used.

               When this statement is used, the older style (BinkleyTerm 2.00
               and previous versions) addressing should NOT be used, such as
               'Aka', 'Point', and 'Zone'.

               Multiple 'Address' statements, each with a different <zone>
               parameter, may be used.  This allows BinkleyTerm to identify
               itself differently to different zones, thereby making multi-
               net operation somewhat more simple.  Note that in this
               scenario, if you are connected to a zone for which an
               'Address' statement does not exist, that the 'Address'
               statement that appears first in the configuration file will
               be used as a default.
               In addition, the zone given in the 'Address' statement that
               appears first determines your "default" outbound area, as
               given by the 'Hold' statement.  Mail for all other zones is
               stored in distinct outbound areas for each zone.  See "Zone
               Support" in the User's Guide for details.

               Point systems should add the optional fakenet address to this
               line rather than use the older Boss, PrivateNet and BossPhone
               statements.  This enables you to be a point from more than one
               system using a different fakenet address for each.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          AfterMail <command_line>

               If used, BinkleyTerm will invoke a DOS shell and execute the
               <command_line> after receiving mail.  It is suggested that
               <command_line> designate a batch file, rather than a specific
               program.  The batch file would contain command line(s) for the
               program(s) that will actually unpack and/or toss incoming
               mail.

               NOTE!  If this statement is used, no E2= or E3= exits during
               event schedules should be used, since they take priority over
               this statement.  Refer to the section "Scheduling Events" for
               details.

               See also 'Packer' and 'Cleanup' for related information.

          Aka <net>/<node>

               NOTE:  This statement is supported for backward compatibility
               only.  If you wish to specify a/k/a addresses, please use the
               newer 'Address' statement described previously.

               Allows nodes with more than one FidoNet address to specify
               their alternate addresses.  This would normally be used by
               network, region or zone coordinators, and other 'special'
               nodes.  Multiple 'Aka' statements can be used.

          Answer <modem_string>

               When this statement is used, BinkleyTerm assumes that the
               modem has been set NOT to answer the phone automatically (by
               the modem initialization string, or the modem's DIP switches).
               When BinkleyTerm receives a response string of "RING" from the
               modem, it sends the <modem_string> command to the modem to
               answer the phone.

               The advantage is that BinkleyTerm must be "alive and well"
               before the modem will answer a call.  If for some reason
               BinkleyTerm is not available, yet the modem still has power,
               no calls will be answered.

               NOTE!  Some modems DO NOT like commands to be sent while
               they're sending response strings...in testing, this feature
               DOES NOT work on all modems.  Only by trying it will you be
               able to determine if it works with your modem.

          AnswerBack <text>

               In Terminal Mode, when an ENQ (ASCII decimal 5, hex 5) is
               received, <text> will be sent in response.  Normal BinkleyTerm
               character translations are available.  Many BBS packages send
               this character immediately prior to requesting a user name.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Application <app_name> [<parm> <parm> ... ]

               Allows addition of application dependent data to the
               configuration file.  Any 'Application' statement is ignored
               by BinkleyTerm entirely.

               <app_name> is the name of or reference to a specific
               application, such as a message editor or outbound maintenance
               utility that uses the BinkleyTerm configuration file.  Zero
               or more application specific parameters, shown as <parm> in
               the example, may follow <app_name>.

          Autobaud

               In Unattended Mode, this forces BinkleyTerm to call out at the
               baud rate specified by the 'Baud' statement, regardless of the
               baud rate associated with a given nodelist entry.  This
               assures connects at the highest possible baud rate.

          Avail <filespec>

               This designates the name of the file to be sent to a remote
               system that file requests "FILES" from your system.  The
               <filespec> identifies the file, and may contain an optional
               drive and path designation.

               Refer to the User's Guide sections "File Requests" and
               "Security - Controlling File Requests" for more information.

          Banner <string>

               The line designated by <string> is sent to callers
               immediately following the BinkleyTerm identification line, and
               before the line, "Press <Escape> to enter BBS."  Generally,
               this is the name of your BBS or something else of interest to
               callers.

          Baud <max_baud_rate>

               This parameter tells BinkleyTerm your maximum baud rate.
               Valid <max_baud_rate> settings are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800,
               9600, 19,200 and 38,400.  In Terminal Mode, you may change
               this setting.  Note that on the Atari ST machines 38400 baud
               is not supported by the OS, but BinkleyTerm will attempt to
               do it by changing hardware registers, this is not very
               reliable however and if you really need 38400 baud then you
               should consider performing a hardware patch to increase the
               baud rate.  See Hard38400 for more information.

          BBS <exit_option>

               This designates the method to be used to access your BBS
               software when a human caller dials your system.  Valid options
               for <exit_option> are 'Batch,' 'Exit' and 'Spawn.'  Refer to
               the User's Guide section "BBS Interface" for more information
               on the options, and how to use them.

        Reference Guide - Page 6
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          BBSNote <string>

               After a human caller presses Escape to access the BBS program,
               or after the number of seconds designated by the 'Timeout'
               statement, BinkleyTerm will display the <string> to the
               caller.  Generally, this is a notification that the BBS
               software is loading.

          Boss <net>/<node>

               NOTE:  This statement is supported for backward compatibility
               only.  It is not needed when the 'Address' statement is used,
               as described previously.

               This specifies a FidoNet node address.  For regular FidoNet
               nodes, place your assigned address here.  For Point systems,
               place the address of your Boss node here.

          BossPhone <phone_number>

               NOTE:  This statement is supported for backward compatibility
               only.  It is not needed when the 'Address' statement is used,
               as described previously.

               This parameter, used in Point installations, contains the
               telephone number of your Boss node for use with the Alt-Y
               command in Terminal Mode.  This statement is optional in all
               cases except Point installations that do not wish to use a
               nodelist.

          BossPwd <password>

               NOTE:  This statement is supported for backward compatibility
               only.  It is not needed when the 'Address' and 'key'
               statements are used as described elsewhere.

               Used for Point installations, this parameter designates the
               password to be used for session-level passwording with your
               Boss node.  Refer to the User's Guide section "Security -
               Session Passwording" for additional information.  The Boss
               node must also have session passwording implemented, using
               this password.

               When this parameter AND 'BossPhone' are BOTH implemented, a
               nodelist is NOT required for a Point system.

          BoxType <number>

               When full-screen mode is used (default), this tells
               BinkleyTerm what type of boxes to use for the various on-
               screen windows.  Legal values are from 0 to 4.  They produce
               the following results (apologies given to people with printers
               that do not support the extended IBM character set):

                    0    1    2    3    4        0 = Hatches (Non-IBM)
                   +-+  ÚÄ¿  ÉÍ»  ÖÄ·  ÕÍ¸       1 = Single Rule
                   | |  ³ ³  º º  º º  ³ ³       2 = Double Rule
                   +-+  ÀÄÙ  ÈÍ¼  ÓÄ½  ÔÍ¾       3 = Single Top, Double Sides
                                                 4 = Double Top, Single Sides

                To make use of any of the types other than 0 on an Atari ST,
                it is recommended to use the program BTFONT by Jon Webb.

          Busy <modem_string>

               While BinkleyTerm performs certain functions, and when you
               exit the program from Unattended Mode, BinkleyTerm sends the
               <modem_string> to the modem.  Normally, this is a short set
               of modem commands, as shown in the sample configuration file,
               to take the phone off-hook to prevent incoming calls.  Callers
               will hear a busy signal.

               You may desire to lower DTR instead using a lower-case letter
               "v."  This would cause callers to hear ringing, but with no
               answer.

          CaptureFile <filename>

               If used, this statement tells BinkleyTerm the name of a file
               to use for session capturing in terminal mode.  The Alt-L
               command toggles session capture on and off.  If this statement
               is not used, then BinkleyTerm will prompt for a name each time
               Alt-L is pressed.  When activated, all communications session
               I/O will be echoed to this file.  The <filename> may
               optionally include a drive and path designation as well.

          Carrier <hex_carrier_mask>

               For backwards compatibility ONLY!  This has no effect on the
               Atari ST.

               This tells BinkleyTerm which status bit it should use
               to determine whether or not carrier is present.  A value of
               80 (hexadecimal) is nearly always correct.  Some modems do not
               support CD (carrier detect) and other signal lines may be
               used.

               NOTE:  This value is in HEXADECIMAL (base 16).  Other systems,
               such as Opus-CBCS, ask for this value in DECIMAL (base 10).
               Normal setting is 80 hex, which equals 128 decimal.

          Cleanup <command_line>

               If used, BinkleyTerm will execute <command_line> at the
               beginning of each event, but prior to the 'Packer' statement's
               command line (if used).  This might be used to unpack any
               previously packed outbound mail for later repacking, or to
               perform minor outbound area maintenance, etc.  It is suggested
               that <command_line> designate a batch file that would contain
               the command line(s) for the program(s) actually used to unpack
               mail and/or perform maintenance.

               See also 'AfterMail' and 'Packer' for related information.

          CLIcommand <string>

               Defines a string passed to a command line interpreter.  If this
               command is used then the default "-c" and "/c" parameters are
               overidden.  Using this command without any parameters disables
               the "-c" and "/c" completely.

               e.g.
                    CLIcommand batch
                  would execute shell's using:
                    $SHELL batch commandline
                  or
                    $COMSPEC batch commandline

          Colors <border> <setting> <today> <pending> <activity> <trnsfr>
                 <rev> <popwin> <named> <frames>

               This statement allows setting of colour attributes for the
               full-screen windowed display.  The arguments are <border> for
               the informational border area around the windows, and the
               following colour attributes: <setting> for the "Current
               Settings" window, <today> for the "Today at a Glance" window,
               <pending> for the "Pending Outbound Mail" window, <activity>
               for the "Recent Activity" window, and <trnsfr> for the
               "Transfer Status" window. The <rev> parameter designates the
               reverse video colour used in the Pending Outbound window to
               mark the node you are calling.  The <popwin> parameter
               designates the colour of pop-up windows (such as those
               produced with the Alt-G and Alt-S commands in Unattended
               Mode). The <named> parameter designates the colour used in
               named windows, <frames> the colour of the frames.
               The default colors are all 7, black background with white
               foreground.




        Reference Guide - Page 9
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

               Each parameter is a colour calculated as:
                    background*16+foreground
               where the colours are the logical colours used by Tos.  e.g.
               on a hi- rez screen they are 0 or 1, on a medium rez 0,1,2,3,
               etc.  Be very careful not to make the background the same as
               the foreground.  Refer to the reference guide for what each
               parameter does.  The actual colours will depend on what you
               set them to with the desktop control accessory.  You'll
               probably be best off simply using Black and White!!!  Tos only
               uses the low bits needed by that resolution so you can specify
               a colour as colour 15, but on a mono screen this will be the
               same as 1.  I hope all that makes sense to you.
               Some recommended colours are:
                Colors 1 3 2 3 3 2 48 32   ; (Medium rez)
               or
                Colors 7 7 7 7 7 7 240 240 ; (Mono/Hirez)


               The default is something like I just recommended for
               monochrome.

               The screen will adjust itself to the physical screen size when
               initialised.  Thus if you are using that program that lets you
               have 50 rows on a mono-screen (instead of the usual 25),
               BinkleyTerm will use the entire screen.

               Line A variables are used to move the cursor about and change
               colours, which makes it quite a bit faster than sending all
               this through the VT52 emulator.

          CurMudgeon

               Undocumented feature of the PC version, treats other systems
               points as nuisance callers and drops carrier.

          CursorCol <column>

               For use with multitasking systems, this tells BinkleyTerm
               the column number to place the cursor after screen writes.
               For DESQview, <column> should be set to 1.  The default value
               is 80.

          CursorRow <row>

               For use with multitasking systems, this tells BinkleyTerm the
               row number to place the cursor after screen writes.  For
               DESQview, <row> should be set to 1.  The default value is 23.


          Debug

               For debugging purposes only! Let's Binkley write very detailed
               information to the logfile when using Beta Test versions.

          Dial <match_string> <new_prefix>/[<new_suffix>]

               This option allows for real-time telephone number translation.
               BinkleyTerm will look at the telephone number it is to send
               to the modem.  If the prefix of the telephone number matches
               that shown in <match_string>, then the prefix will be changed
               to <new_prefix>, and <new_suffix> (optional) will be added to
               the end.

               In most cases, this will be used to strip-off "1-" and/or area
               codes for systems in a local exchange, such as:
               DIAL 1-603-888 888/

               A number in the nodelist as 1-603-888-8179 would be changed
               to simply 888-8179 and dialled.

               DIAL 1-303-555 555/&M0

               A number in the nodelist as 1-303-555-1234 would be changed
               to 555-1234&M0 and dialled.

               There is a maximum of 20 characters each for <match_string>,
               <new_prefix> and <new_suffix>.

               Another use for this feature would be for dialling scripts:

               DIAL 1-404 "GA_PCP.SCR"404/

               This line could be used to invoke a PC Pursuit script, for
               example, for the state of Georgia.  The script would be used
               for all outgoing calls to area code 404.

               For permanent translations it is probably more efficient to
               perform these translations with your nodelist processing
               program (i.e., XlatList, ParseLst, XlaxNode).  Refer to your
               nodelist processing software documentation for more
               information.

          DoingMail <string>

               If used, this statement will cause BinkleyTerm to send
               <string> to a caller when an event without a 'B' flag is
               active, indicating that BBS access is NOT allowed.  This
               replaces the default string "Processing Mail.  Please hang
               up."  See the section "Scheduling Events" for more information
               on event flags.

          Domain <designator> <abbreviation> [<nodelist>]

               Domain addressing adds an additional "layer" to address
               designation that represents a particular network.  Within that
               network, zones and nets can all be specified without conflict to
               identical zones and nets in other networks.

               The <designator> is the actual domain name. For example,
               FidoNet would be "fidonet.org" and Alternet would use
               "alternet.ftn" for the designator.

               The <abbreviation> is the abbreviated form of the domain name,
               and is LIMITED TO EIGHT (8) CHARACTERS.  This name is passed in
               the packet header during a session.  In most cases, this will be
               the common name of the network, such as "fidonet" or "alternet"
               in our examples.

               Finally, the optional <nodelist> parameter provides the base
               nodelist name to associate with this domain.  If not given, it
               defaults to the name given for the <abbreviation> parameter.
               In our examples, "nodelist" would be used for FidoNet, while
               "anetlist" would be used for Alternet.

               Here are two complete examples of the use of the 'Domain'
               statement, one for FidoNet, one for Alternet:

                         Domain fidonet.org fidonet nodelist
                         Domain alternet.ftn alternet anetlist

               NOTE:  If you designate a domain in your 'Address' statement,
               or in your 'Key' statement, then you must also create
               a corresponding 'Domain' statement.

               NOTE: The best way to order thing in BINKLEY.CFG is:
                    Domain statements
                    Address statements
                    Key statements
               Having them in a different order may cause strange things
               to happen.

               Please refer to the complete Domain explanation later in this
               reference.

          Downloads <path>

               This tells BinkleyTerm where to place files downloaded while
               in Terminal Mode.  The <path> is a complete drive and path
               designation.  This path has no effect on mail transfers made
               in Unattended Mode.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          DTRHigh

               If used, BinkleyTerm will leave the DTR (data terminal ready)
               line to the modem "high" whenever it is exiting.  By default,
               BinkleyTerm takes the DTR line "low" when exiting.  The use
               of 'DTRHigh' has no effect when doing an Alt-J shell escape
               which will leave DTR low.  'DTRHigh' should be used with
               modems that go back on-hook when DTR is lowered.

          EnterBBS <string>

               If used, this statement will cause BinkleyTerm to send
               <string> to a caller when the BBS is available, during events
               with a 'B' flag, indicating that BBS access is allowed.  This
               replaces the default string "Press <Escape> to enter BBS."
               Note that <string> must not exceed one line.  See the section
               "Scheduling Events" for more information on event flags.

          Event <event_flags...>

               NOTE!  Normally the 'Event' statement is used only in the
               event file, BINKLEY.EVT.  Events should NOT be scheduled in
               the configuration file.  This statement begins an event line.
               Due to the depth of this topic, it is covered in the section
               "Scheduling Events."

          ExtrnMail [<errorlevel>] <string>

               This is used in conjunction with BinkleyTerm's external mail
               program feature.  If while waiting for a YooHoo or TSYNC (the
               beginning of a FidoNet mail session) BinkleyTerm receives
               <string>, it will write to the disk a file named MAILBAT.BAT,
               and will then exit with an errorlevel of 99.  Refer to the
               User's Guide section "External Mail Programs" for information.

               Note that if the [<errorlevel>] parameter is used, BinkleyTerm
               will exit with an errorlevel of the value given, rather than
               the default value of 99.

               When used for an external mail program, <string> should be
               relatively long, without too many repeating characters, to
               assure accuracy.  When used with multiple BBS functionality,
               <string> may be only one letter.

               Up to 16 "ExtrnMail" statements that each use [<errorlevel>]
               may be used.

          Flags <dir>

               The directory name specified is used by BinkleyTerm to create
               task identification files.  The filename is TASK.# where # is
               the task number.  These files can be used to determine if any
               given Binkley task is currently running.  The file is created
               whenever Binkley has carrier present and a mail session is
               in progress.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          FTS_0001

               When used, this statement will force BinkleyTerm to use only
               base FidoNet protocol (FTS-0001), effectively enabling the
               equivalent of the following statements:  NoWaZOO, NoResync,
               NoSLO, NoEMSI and NoSEAlink.  Used mostly for debugging and
               testing of FidoNet policy compliance; not for regular use.

          Gong

               Using this statement causes BinkleyTerm to sound an alarm when
               it successfully connects with a system it's attempting dial,
               or after a download has been completed.  'Gong' is only
               applicable in Terminal Mode.  Note that 'Gong' also works when
               doing a manual mail poll operation in Terminal Mode (Alt-M).

          Hard38400

               Assumes you have patched the 68901 serial chip to do 38400 bps.

          HardCTS

               Enables Iain Paton's code to always make sure CTS is low before
               sending anything to the RS232.

          Hold <path>

               This specifies the complete drive and path designation for the
               directory that will be used as your outbound mail holding
               area.  oMMM and/or other mail processing software places
               outbound mail in this area for BinkleyTerm to send to or hold
               for other FidoNet systems.

               It should be mentioned that this area should NOT contain any
               other files of any kind, and that the contents of the
               directory should NOT be manipulated by you unless you know
               EXACTLY what you're doing.  For all practical purposes,
               BinkleyTerm maintains this directory for you.

          HoldOnUs

               If this is put into BINKLEY.CFG then Hold files will be
               sent when calling out. Can be followed by a list of nodes for
               which it takes effect. The nodes may use wildcards. Also a node
               may be preceded by a '-' (hyphen or minus sign) which indicates
               that this node should NOT have the effect.

          IKBDclock

               Updates the GEMDOS clock from the IKBD clock at a regular
               bases. This used to fix timing problems, occurring because,
               when using TOS 1.4 or TurboCTS, the 200Hz timer doesn't seem
               to get through.

          Include <filename>

               If used, this tells BinkleyTerm the name of a file to include
               while reading the configuration file.  The include file must
               contain additional configuration file statements in the same
               format as expected for the primary configuration file.  When
               end-of-file is reached, BinkleyTerm will continue reading the
               main configuration file at the line immediately following the
               "Include" statement that initially caused BinkleyTerm to
               branch.

               The <filename> may optionally include a drive and path
               designation.  Example:  C:\BT\INCL_2.CFG

          Init <modem_string>

               BinkleyTerm sends the <modem_string> to the modem to
               initialize it, and make it ready for communication.  The
               string is sent to the modem verbatim, with the exception of
               special dial translation characters.  These characters are
               shown in the section "Dial Translations."

               Refer to your modem instruction manual for help in finding a
               correct init string for your particular modem and
               configuration.

          Key [#alias] [%prefix/phone] [!password] address

               Parameters in [] are optional, but there should be
               at least one of them!

               The phone number will override any other number
               (e.g. from Address statement or the nodelist).

               The format of the %prefix/phone is either:
                    prefix/               e.g. %ATB1&G2DT/
                    prefix/phone          e.g. %ATB1&G2DT/012-345-6789
                    phone                 e.g. %012-345-6789

               This means that you can't use the '/' character in the prefix
               string.

               The purpose of this statement is:
               - make it possible to temporarily add new nodes who you want
               to call that aren't in the nodelist yet without the hassle
               of editing nodelists.
               e.g. I wanted to call 2:244/470, but the number was not
               in the nodelist, so I added:
                    Key %010-49-7151-61494 2:244/470

               Binkley will display the caller's name as "binkley's Boss",
               but I don't think this matters.

               - To add special modem command prefixes to certain nodes.
               For example you might want to force a particular type of
               connection or change the guard tone settings for some nodes.

               - For points to call other systems without having to
               set up a separate Address or have a nodelist.

               If an #alias is used that hasn't been defined, then a
               warning will be displayed and the KEY ignored! Most people
               should have no use for the <#alias> part of a KEY
               statement as Binkley will automatically assume the correct
               alias depending on zone and domain information.

          KnownAbout <filespec>

               This tells BinkleyTerm the name of the ABOUT file, a special
               file used with incoming file requests.  <filespec> is a
               complete drive, path and filename designation.  This ABOUT
               file applies only to file requests that are received from
               "known" systems.
               Refer to the User's Guide sections "File Requests" and
               "Security - Controlling File Requests" for more information.

          KnownAvail <filespec>

               This designates the name of the file to be sent to a "known"
               remote system which file requests "FILES" from you.  The
               <filespec> identifies the file, and may contain an optional

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          KnownReqLim <quantity>

               This tells BinkleyTerm the maximum number of files that will
               be sent in response to incoming file requests during any one
               mail session.  Regardless of whether the incoming requests has
               wildcards, or whether multiple file requests are sent in one
               mail session, the maximum number of files that will be sent
               in response to an incoming file request will be no greater
               than <quantity>.

               This statement applies only to "known" systems.

          KnownReqTpl <filespec>

               This designates the name of the response file template used
               for request response file construction.  The <filespec> is a
               complete drive, path and filename designation.  This template
               applies only for response files generated for "known" systems.

          LineUpdate

               Undocumented feature from the PC. Forces logfile to be flushed
               after every entry, instead of leaving it to the mercy of the
               buffered I/O library. Can be useful if it keeps bombing or

          LogLevel <log_level_number>

               This tells BinkleyTerm how verbose to make the status log.
               Acceptable values for <log_level_number> are from 1 to 5, 1
               indicating minimal information, 5 maximum information.  See
               the 'Statuslog' option for additional information.

               Each log entry is preceded by a character or a blank,
               indicating the importance of the entry.

               LogLevel  Characters That Precede Included Entries

                    5      ! * + : # and blank (no character)

          Macro <number> <macro_string>

               This allows the sending of predefined macros from within
               Terminal Mode.  Macros are typically used to send your name,
               user ID, or passwords while on-line.

               The <number> parameter is a digit between 1 and 9, which
               corresponds to the F1 through F9 keys.  While in Terminal
               Mode, you send a macro by pressing Alt-Fx, x indicating the
               macro number you desire to send.

               The <macro_string> is sent verbatim.  A carriage return is
               indicated by the pipe symbol (|).  No other translations take
               place.

          MailNote <string>

               Used in conjunction with BinkleyTerm's external mail program
               feature.  When the string designated by the 'ExtrnMail'
               statement is received, <string> is sent to the caller as
               notification that the external mail program is being loaded.
               Refer to the User's Guide section "External Mail Programs" for
               information.

          MaxBytes

               Together with the 'ProtMaxBytes' and 'KnownMaxBytes'
               statements, you can control file requests by number of bytes
               sent.  These three statements work in the same manner as the
               other file request limiting statements detailed in the
               documentation.

               Tells Binkley the maximum number of ports the hardware has
               available.

          MaxReq <quantity>

               This tells BinkleyTerm the maximum number of files that will
               be sent in response to incoming file requests during any one
               mail session.  Regardless of whether the incoming requests has

          ModemTrans <number> <prefix>/[<suffix>]

               This statement allows BinkleyTerm to dynamically select the
               modem prefix and suffix strings based on the modem type field
               found in a Version 6 or compatible nodelist, or in a
               NODELIST.EXT file (see section "Nodelist" in the User's Guide)

               The <prefix>/[<suffix>] have the same purpose and usage as
               they do in conjunction with the 'Dial' statement described
               previously.  Refer to 'Dial' above for more information.

               The value of <number> corresponds to a given modem type.  If
               this type is matched, then the given <prefix>/[<suffix>]
               values are used.  Possible values currently are:

                    <number>  Nodelist Modem Flag Set

          NetFile <path>

               This specifies the complete drive and path of the directory
               that will hold files being sent to your system via FidoNet.
               Incoming mail is stored here prior to processing.  This path
               is also used by BTCTL to create a MAIL.SYS file.

               If secured inbound areas are being used (see 'ProtInbound' and
               'KnownInbound' in this Reference Guide, or the section
               "Security - Secured Inbound File Areas" in the User's Guide),
               then this statement designated the inbound file path for mail
               received from systems not in the nodelist and not password
               protected.

          NetMail <path>

               This specifies the complete drive and path of the directory
               that contains a Fido compatible message base.

               Note that this directory is not used by BinkleyTerm itself.
               This path is used to build a MAIL.SYS file when the BTCTL
               program is run.  MAIL.SYS is produced for the benefit of
               certain mail processing utilities.

          NewNodelist

               This statement tells BinkleyTerm that it is to use a "New Opus
               Style" Version 6 nodelist.  The files NODELIST.IDX and
               NODELIST.DAT will be expected, and must be compiled and ready
               for use by BinkleyTerm.  Refer to the User's Guide section
               "Nodelist" for more information.

          NiceOutBound

               If this statement is used then the small outbound window will
               display more information including the packet size and date.

          NLBaud

               The baud rate to be specified in the nodelist.  This is not
               necessarily the same as your DTE speed.  If you have a high
               speed modem then generally 9600 is used. e.g.
               NLbaud 9600

               Intended to be used to create a nodelist entry for you.
               See also: NLSystem, NLFlags, City, Phone.

               If these are not specified then BinkleyTerm will try its best
               to make up the data from what it has available.

               It is probably a good idea to set these up yourself, because in
               the future it is possible that this feature may be used by
               nethosts to automatically keep the nodelist up to date.

          NoCollide

               By default, BinkleyTerm will make an attempt to detect an
               incoming call while preparing to make an outgoing call, and
               abort the outgoing call process.  This feature is called "call
               collision detection," and may not work on all modems.  Using
               'NoCollide' disables this feature entirely.

          NoCTS

               Used to disable the RTS/CTS control (default enabled)

          Nodelist <path>

               This specifies the complete drive and path where processed,
               compiled nodelist files can be found.  Refer to the User's
               Guide section "Nodelist" for more information.

          NoEMSI [<node>], [[-]<node>], ...

               Disable EMSI protocol. Can be followed by a list of nodes for
               which it takes effect. The nodes may use wildcards. Also a node
               may be preceded by a '-' (hyphen or minus sign) which indicates
               that this node should NOT have the effect. Intended for
               testing purposes only.

          NoFullScreen

               By default, BinkleyTerm uses a full-screen interface when in
               Unattended Mode.  When this statement is used, BinkleyTerm
               will use the line-by-line screen write mode employed by
               BinkleyTerm Version 1.10 and earlier.  This statement has no
               effect in Terminal Mode.

          NoLineA

               If this is present in BINKLEY.CFG then colours are set using
               the VT52 commands rather than the linea variables.

          NoPickup

               This statement tells BinkleyTerm that during mail sessions,
               it should only deliver mail, and refuse to pickup any mail
               that may be waiting for your system.

          NoRequests

               This statement tells BinkleyTerm to universally refuse
               incoming file requests at all times.

          NoResync

               When used, this statement will tell BinkleyTerm not to allow
               SEAlink Resync (an ability to restart failed SEAlink mail
               sessions).  Used mostly for debugging purposes; not for
               regular use.

        Reference Guide - Page 22
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          NoSEAlink

               When used, this statement will tell BinkleyTerm not to allow
               SEAlink mail sessions at all, including SEAlink extensions
               to base FidoNet protocol (FTS-0007) and WaZOO/DietIFNA
               sessions.

          NoSLO

               This tells BinkleyTerm NOT to employ SEAlink "Overdrive" (an
               ACK-less variety of the SEAlink protocol) for any SEAlink
               network mail transfers.

          NoWaZOO

               Forces BinkleyTerm to be strictly an FSC-0001 mailer by
               disabling WaZOO functionality.  This is primarily of interest
               to coordinators who wish to verify that their nodes are
               meeting FidoNet compatibility requirements.

               There is no benefit to the average user from using this
               statement.  In fact, performance with other WaZOO-capable
               mailers (BinkleyTerm, Opus, D'Bridge, FrontDoor, etc.) will
               be adversely affected.

          NoZedZap

               When used, this statement will tell BinkleyTerm not to allow
               ZedZap (Zmodem) transfers during a WaZOO session.  It is
               primarily intended to force BinkleyTerm to use DietIFNA mode
               (SEAlink) during WaZOO sessions.  Used mostly for debugging
               purposes; not for regular use.

          NoZones

               Tells BinkleyTerm to handle zones in the same manner as
               version 1.50 and previous versions.  This essentially means
               that multi-zone support is turned off.  Refer to the User's
               Guide section "Zone Support" for additional information.

          Okfile <filespec>

               This designates the name of the OKFILE, a special file used
               with incoming file requests.  <filespec> is a complete drive,
               path and filename designation.

               For more information, refer to the User's Guide sections "File
               Requests" and "Controlling File Requests."

          Overwrite

               When receiving a file in Unattended Mode, or when  downloading
               a file in Terminal Mode, BinkleyTerm by default will NOT allow
               overwriting of an existing file if you're receiving a file
               with the same name.  Instead, BinkleyTerm will slightly alter
               the name of the file being received to differentiate it from
               the existing file.  By using the 'Overwrite' statement,
               BinkleyTerm WILL ALLOW overwriting of existing files should
               you be receiving one by the same name.

               Use this option carefully.

          Packer <command_line>

               If used, BinkleyTerm will execute <command_line> at the
               beginning of each event, but after the "Cleanup" statement's
               command line (if used).  This might be used to pack any
               pending outbound mail for sending.  It is suggested that
               <command_line> designate a batch file that would contain the
               command line(s) for the program(s) actually used to scan
               and/or pack mail.

               See also 'AfterMail' and 'Cleanup' for related information.

          Phone

               This should be the full international number in the same
               format as in the nodelist or the word "-unpublished-".

               Intended to be used to create a nodelist entry for you.
               See also: NLSystem, NLFlags, NLBaud, City.

          Point <net>/<node>

               NOTE:  This statement is supported for backward compatibility
               only.  To specify a system address, use the 'Address'
               statement described previously.

               This parameter specifies a FidoNet node address.  For regular
               FidoNet nodes, this is your assigned node address.  For Point
               systems, this address is the one assigned to you by your Boss
               node Sysop.

          PollDelay <time>

               Sets the time to wait between poll retries.  The time is
               specifed in 10ths of a second and defaults to 20 (2 seconds).









        Reference Guide - Page 24
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          PollTries <number>

               This controls how many call attempts BinkleyTerm will make
               under the following circumstances:
                    - Alt-D keypress in Terminal Mode
                    - Alt-M keypress in Terminal or Unattended Mode
                    - BT POLL command line invocation of BinkleyTerm

               BinkleyTerm will make <number> attempts, then stop.

          Port <port_number>

               This informs BinkleyTerm which communications port your modem
               is connected to or configured as. On the Atari ST, there is
               only one communications port, the TT has two (the ST compatible
               one being number 1).
               For backward compatibility only.

          PreDial <modem_string>

               The <modem_string> designates a string, which will have
               standard modem translations performed upon it, that is to be
               sent to the modem BEFORE the dial string (designated by the
               'Prefix' statement) is sent.  BinkleyTerm has a default
               'PreDial' string of:
                    v``^`````

               Some modems give responses when DTR is lowered, and others
               require an extended period of time to resync.  By using
               'PreDial,' you can override the default to provide an outward
               dialling situation better suited to your modem.  In testing,
               a single backquote (`) has been used with the USR HST high
               speed modem to provide extremely fast outward dialling
               responsiveness.

          Prefix <modem_string>

               The <modem_string> is a modem command to cause the modem to
               dial.  To dial a system, BinkleyTerm sends the <modem_string>,
               followed by the telephone number, to the modem.  Normally, for
               touch-tone systems, "ATDT," is used, for rotary-dial lines,
               "ATDP," would be used.

               Refer to your modem manual for more information on control
               options.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          PreInit <modem_string>

               The <modem_string> designates a string, which will have
               standard modem translations performed upon it, that is to be
               sent to the modem BEFORE the modem initialization string
               (designated by the 'Init' statement) is sent.  BinkleyTerm
               has a default 'PreInit' string of:

                    |v~^````` |`````

               The default string is optimized to be suitable for a wide
               variety of modems.  However, many modems may be able to work
               with a shorter string, which would yield faster modem
               initialization sequences.  In testing, this 'PreInit' string
               has proven effective:

                    |v``^``

               Using this string, the initialization sequence is very fast.
               Note that 1/2 second is still added at the end of the
               'PreInit' string for timing purposes, and therefore, 1/2
               second is the fastest initialization that could be realized
               by using your own 'PreInit' setting.

          PrivateNet <net>

               For backward compatibility only. Use the 'Address' statement
               instead.

               This tells BinkleyTerm the net number of a private network for
               which you serve as a gateway, if any.  This statement is also
               used on Point systems to designate their private net number.

               When this parameter is used, Point systems you support may
               poll you with a complete Point address to pick-up any waiting
               mail.  Please note that the mail must still be addressed to
               the private address assigned to the Point, as Point addressing
               is not taken into consideration in the naming of outbound
               mail.

          ProtAbout <filespec>

               This tells BinkleyTerm the name of the ABOUT file, a special
               file used with incoming file requests.  The <filespec> is a
               complete drive, path and filename designation.  This ABOUT
               file applies only to file requests that are received from
               "protected" systems.

               Refer to the User's Guide sections "File Requests" and
               "Security - Controlling File Requests" for more information.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          ProtAvail <filespec>

               This designates the name of the file to be sent to a
               "protected" remote system which file requests "FILES" from
               you.  The <filespec> identifies the file, and may contain an
               optional drive and path designation.

               Refer to the User's Guide sections "File Requests" and
               "Security - Controlling File Requests" for more information.

          ProtInbound <path>

               Used with secured inbound areas, this statement designates the
               path to the inbound file area used for mail received from
               "protected" systems.

               Refer to the User's Guide section "Security - Secured Inbound
               File Area" for more information.

          ProtMaxBytes

               See 'MaxBytes' for information.

          ProtMaxTime <time>

               Limits FREQ's by time. <time> is in seconds.
               Default if unspecified is 30 minutes.

          Protocol <filespec>

               This tells BinkleyTerm that it can use the listed external
               file transfer protocol within Terminal Mode.  The <filespec>
               is a complete drive, path and filename that points to an Opus-
               CBCS compatible external file transfer protocol program.
               Refer to the User's Guide section "External Protocols" for
               more information.

               Note that the first letter of <filespec> will be the letter
               used to access the protocol from the upload and download menus
               in Terminal Mode.  Because the first letter of the filename
               may conflict with another external protocol, or with a hard-
               coded protocol, you may need to rename the executable file for
               the external protocol to begin with a letter that is not
               currently in use.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          ProtReqLim <quantity>

               This tells BinkleyTerm the maximum number of files that will
               be sent in response to incoming file requests during any one
               mail session.  Regardless of whether the incoming requests has
               wildcards, or whether multiple file requests are sent in one
               mail session, the maximum number of files that will be sent
               in response to an incoming file request will be no greater
               than <quantity>.

               This statement applies only to file requests that are received
               from "protected" systems.

               Refer to the User's Guide sections "File Requests" and
               "Security - Controlling File Requests" for more information.

          ProtReqList <filespec>

               This designates the name of the OKFILE, a special used with
               incoming file requests.  <filespec> is a complete drive, path
               and filename designation.  This OKFILE applies only to file
               requests received from "protected" systems.

               For more information, refer to the User's Guide sections "File
               Requests" and "Security - Controlling File Requests."

          ProtReqTpl <filespec>

               This designates the name of the response file template used
               for request response file construction.  The <filespec> is a
               complete drive, path and filename designation.  This template
               applies only for response files generated for "protected"
               systems.

               For more information, refer to the User's Guide sections
               "Request Response Files" and "Security - Response File
               Templates."

          Reader <command_line>

               Using the Alt-E command in Unattended Mode causes BinkleyTerm
               to execute <command_line> as a program.  This is typically used
               to invoke your local console message base reader/editor.  If
               using a shell such as Craft then the command_line is passed to
               the shell.

          ReadHoldTime <min>

               Specifies the time between re-reads of the Outbound directories.
               <min> is the time in minutes. Default of <min> is a very
               large number, but may be reduced if, for example,
               you are in a multitasking environment.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          ReInitTime <min>

               Set the time between modem re-initialisations. <min> is the
               time in minutes and defaults to 10.

          ReqOnUs

               When this statement is used, incoming file requests will be
               filled, even if your system initiated the call.  Otherwise,
               incoming requests "on your dime" will be refused.

          ReqTemplate <filespec>

               This designates the name of the response file template used
               for request response file construction.  The <filespec> is a
               complete drive, path and filename designation.
               For more information, refer to the User's Guide sections
               "Request Response Files" and "Security - Response File
               Templates."

          SameRing

               By default, and unless the 'NoCollide' option is used,
               BinkleyTerm will attempt to abort its dialling process if an
               incoming call is detected.  This feature is called "call
               collision detection."  'SameRing' is used when your modem
               reports "RING" on BOTH incoming and outgoing calls (most
               modems reports "RING" on incoming and "RINGING" on outgoing),
               and partially disables this feature.

          ScreenBlank [<method>]

               If 'ScreenBlank' is used, and 10 minutes pass without any
               activity (incoming call, outgoing call), then the screen will
               be blanked.  The screen will remain blanked until the user
               presses the space bar.  Once the space bar is pressed, the
               next time BinkleyTerm writes to the screen, the screen will
               be reactivated. The <method> parameter
               may be "Key" or "Call" and tells BinkleyTerm which
               method to use to "unblank" the display.  "Key" tells it to
               unblank upon a keypress (and is the default); "Call" tells
               it to unblank when a call comes in or is placed.

          ScriptPath <path>

               If given, this statement tells BinkleyTerm where to look for
               outward dialling scripts (refer to the section "Scripts" for
               more information).  <path> is a standard DOS path line, with
               optional drive designation.

          SendRSP

               This statement is used to make Binkley send out the old style
               *.RSP files instead of NetMail packets.

               By default FSC-0048 packets are used.

          Shell <number> <command_line>

               This allows you configure up to 9 keystroke accessible DOS
               shells to run programs while BinkleyTerm stays memory
               resident.  Shells work only in Unattended Mode.  While in
               Terminal Mode, the same keystrokes work as macros keys (see
               the 'Macro' statement description for information).

               The <number> parameter is a digit between 1 and 9, which
               corresponds to the F1 through F9 keys.  While in Unattended
               Mode, you invoke a shell by pressing Alt-Fx, x indicating the
               shell number you wish to invoke.

               The <command_line> is either executed as a program or passed
               to a resident shell such as SHELL for execution.  See the
               discussion elsewhere about the SHELL and COMSPEC environment
               variables for more details.

          SlowJanus

               This prevents Janus from transmitting packets until the Tx
               buffer is empty. This slows down Janus a bit without appearing
               to be more reliable. However using this the RTS/CTS handshaking
               doesn't come into play so often (if you have set the RS232
               buffers wisely).

          SlowModem

               Using 'SlowModem' causes BinkleyTerm to insert a 1/10th second
               delay between each character sent to the modem while in
               command mode.  This is for use with modems that may have a
               hard time keeping up with BinkleyTerm's modem commands
               otherwise.

          SmallWindow

               During mail transfers that use the SEAlink protocol,
               BinkleyTerm uses a default run ahead, in blocks, of the baud
               rate divided by 400.  Using this statement tells BinkleyTerm
               to run ahead no more than 6 blocks.  This option is used
               primarily with high speed modems.









        Reference Guide - Page 30
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Statuslog <filespec> [<length>]

               This tells BinkleyTerm where to log information about its
               operation and mail sessions.  This log is completely
               compatible with the log file used by Opus-CBCS.  The
               <filespec> is a complete drive, path and filename designation.
               Various information is placed in the log.
               <length> is the length of the logfile before it is trimmed in K.

               e.g. To keep the log file to around 50K use:
                    StatusLog c:\bt\binkley.log 50

               Whilst trimming a temporary file is created, so you will need
               at least the same size free diskspace.

               See also the configuration file statement 'LogLevel.'

          STlockBaud <value>

               This configuration file statement is provided for backwards
               compatibility, but is considered obsolete.  You should lock
               the hardware baud rate instead. The <lock_rate>
               parameter tells BinkleyTerm what baud rate at which locking
               should occur.  This is useful for modems that allow a
               floating baud rate to a certain speed, then are locked at
               higher connect rates.

               Most ROM revisions of the USRobotics Courier HST 14.4k model
               and the USRobotics Courier HST Dual Standard allow this type
               of operation by setting the modem for &B0 which floats the
               baud rate at 2400 bps or lower.  Bit 7 (and perhaps Bit 6)
               of the S27 register also need to be set appropriately.

               TO LOCK AT 19200 AND FLOAT AT SLOW SPEEDS:  Use the
               'Baud 19200' and 'LockBaud 4800' statements in your
               configuration file, and set the modem for &B0 and S27=128.

               TO LOCK AT 38400 AND FLOAT AT SLOW SPEEDS:  Use the
               'Baud 38400' and 'LockBaud 4800' statements in your
               configuration file, and set the modem for &B0 and S27=192.

          Suffix <modem_string>

               BinkleyTerm will send the 'Prefix' string, followed by the
               phone number, followed by a carriage return to the modem for
               the purpose of dialling a number.  If for some reason you need
               to put characters immediately after the phone number BUT PRIOR
               TO THE RETURN CODE use the 'Suffix' field.

               NOTE:  Unlike some communications packages such as Telix,
               normally you DO NOT need a 'Suffix' with BinkleyTerm.  Use the
               'Suffix' field ONLY for adding characters to the end of the
               phone number, if needed.

          Sysop <sysop_name>

               The WaZOO method of mail transfer (originally designed by Wynn
               Wagner for Opus-CBCS, and supported by BinkleyTerm) sends a
               variety of information during session negotiation.  Among the
               information is the Sysop name, normally your name.  This
               information is not passed during FTS-0001 mail session, and
               has no effect in Terminal Mode.

          System <system_name>

               The WaZOO method of mail transfer sends a variety of
               information during session negotiation.  Among the information
               is the system name, normally whatever name you have given to
               your BBS or Point system.  This information is not passed
               during FTS-0001 mail sessions, and has no effect in Terminal
               Mode.

          TaskNumber <number>

               This statement performs two functions for persons operating
               in multi-processing or multi-line environments (through a
               LAN or multitasker).

               First, it designates a task number for the BinkleyTerm that
               uses the configuration file that this statement appears
               inside of.  The <number> parameter must be greater than zero
               (0).

               Second, it tells BinkleyTerm to operate in "multi-processor
               smart mode."  If BinkleyTerm is transacting with a
               particular system, it will create a "xxxxyyyy.BSY" file for
               that node, named in the conventional packet form (xxxx = net
               number in hex, yyyy = node number in hex).  This file can
               serve as a flag to other BinkleyTerm tasks, or to compatible
               mail processing packages so that other tasks or processors
               will not handle any mail for the particular node until the
               ".BSY" file is gone.  Additionally, BinkleyTerm will not
               send files to any node for which there is a ".BSY" file.

          TermInit  <modem_string>

               Identical in structure to the 'Init' statement, this
               statement provides a modem initialization string that
               BinkleyTerm will use in Terminal Mode.  The string will be
               sent to the modem if BinkleyTerm is initialized in Terminal
               Mode, or when switched to Terminal Mode from Unattended
               Mode.  The string will also be sent when an Alt-I command is
               issued in Terminal Mode.  NOTE:  The 'PreInit' statement, if
               designated, will NOT be used in conjunction with this
               initialization string.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Timeout <seconds>

               This sets the number of seconds that BinkleyTerm will wait for
               a caller to press Escape or for a mail session to begin before
               assuming that the incoming call is human.  The default value
               is 20 seconds.  Note that <seconds> cannot be set lower than
               20.

          Unattended

               By default, BinkleyTerm is in Terminal Mode when invoked.
               When this statement is used, BinkleyTerm will be in Unattended
               Mode when invoked from DOS.  This option should be used on
               systems where BinkleyTerm's primary purpose is as a FidoNet
               mail interface.

          Zone <zone_number>

               NOTE:  This statement is supported for backward compatibility
               only.  Please use the 'Address' statement discussed previously
               to designate a zone.

               This is part of the FidoNet node address for your BinkleyTerm
               system, and refers to the part of the globe you live in.
               Current FidoNet zones are 1 for the Americas, 2 for Europe,
               3 for the South Pacific and 4 for South America.

          SCHEDULING EVENTS

          As mentioned elsewhere in this manual, one of the driving forces
          behind BinkleyTerm mail handling is cost.  Rigid scheduling,
          although taking a back seat, still retains some importance.  In
          order for BinkleyTerm to know when it's time to send mail that
          requires a toll call, and in order for it to know when it can send
          to systems that do not accept Continuous Mail, event schedules are
          used.  Several other features are controlled by events as well.

          Although events may be placed in the configuration file, they
          should be contained in a special file named BINKLEY.EVT.  In this
          way, small changes to the configuration file will not cause
          BinkleyTerm to re-run the current event; this will only happen if
          the BINKLEY.EVT file is edited.

          By storing event schedules in a flat text file, events can be
          easily edited at any time with a standard ASCII text editor.  No
          special utilities are required.

          Note that each time an edit is made to BINKLEY.EVT (or to the
          configuration file if events are listed there), BinkleyTerm will
          re-build its binary schedule file, which will in turn cause
          BinkleyTerm to re-run the current event when the system is brought
          on-line.  This is normal operation, and is necessary to allow
          BinkleyTerm to properly register the schedule changes.

          Each event is on a separate line in the BINKLEY.EVT or
          configuration file.  Here is a sample of such a line:

               Event All 03:00 04:00 L=10 N B E1=10 E2=20 E3=30

          The syntax for the entries is:
               Event <day> <start> [<stop>] [<string>] <flags/options>

          <day>

               This tells BinkleyTerm which days this event line applies to.
               Options are:
                    All . . . . Every day of the week
                    Week  . . . Weekdays, Monday through Friday only
                    WkEnd . . . Weekends, Saturday and Sunday only
                    Sun . . . . Sunday only
                    Mon . . . . Monday only
                    Tue . . . . Tuesday only
                    Wed . . . . Wednesday only
                    Thu . . . . Thursday only
                    Fri . . . . Friday only
                    Sat . . . . Saturday only

               The parameters can be linked with the pipe character (|) to
               indicate more than one option.  For example, "Mon|Wed|Fri"
               would that the event applies to Monday, Wednesday and Friday
               only.  No spaces may be used between the parameters.  The
               <day> parameter is REQUIRED.

        Reference Guide - Page 34
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          <start>

               This tells BinkleyTerm what time to start the event, in 24
               hour "military" time, in the format hh:mm, where hh is the
               hour and mm is the minute.  Note that <start> must NOT be
               greater than <stop>, i.e., events may NOT stretch through the
               midnight hour.  The <start> parameter is REQUIRED.

               The <start> parameter may optionally take date information as
               well.  Allowable additional information is the month in
               numeric form (1 for January, 2 for February and so on, ending
               with 12 for December) and a day of the month.  This additional
               information is used IN ADDITION to the <day> parameter
               previously described.  A field that includes date information
               would be in the format:

                     hh:mm,month,day

               Where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, month is the numeric
               month, and day is the day of the month.  You may also leave
               out the day parameter, like this:

                    hh:mm,month

               If you wish to leave out a month parameter, simply place a
               zero into that field, indicating that the event is to take
               place on all months, like this:

                    hh:mm,0,day

               Using the date options with the <start> parameter offers
               significant scheduling power.  For example, if you wanted
               something to occur on the second Friday of each month, you can
               do so without a lot of manipulation by creating seven events
               with the same errorlevel, each corresponding the possible date
               values for the second Friday of each month, like this:

                    Fri 23:00,0,8  23:00 F E1=131
                    Fri 23:00,0,9  23:00 F E1=131
                    Fri 23:00,0,10 23:00 F E1=131
                    Fri 23:00,0,11 23:00 F E1=131
                    Fri 23:00,0,12 23:00 F E1=131
                    Fri 23:00,0,13 23:00 F E1=131
                    Fri 23:00,0,14 23:00 F E1=131

               In any given month, the event required on the second Friday
               of the month would cause an errorlevel 131 exit (which has
               been previously associated in your batch file with the
               function you wish to occur).

               In you wanted something to happen every leap year, you could
               create an event like this:

                    All 23:15,2,29 23:15 F E1=132

               Which would cause an errorlevel 132 exit on February 29.

        Reference Guide - Page 35
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

               Note that if you want a specific exit on a specific date
               regardless of the day-of-the-week, you should use "All" for
               the <day> parameter for that event.

          [<stop>]

               This tells BinkleyTerm what time to stop the event.  This
               parameter is OPTIONAL, and defaults to 60 minutes after the
               start time should the parameter be omitted.  This is given in
               the same format the <start> parameter, as military time, hh:mm
               where hh is the hour and mm is the minute.

          [<string>]

               This parameter is OPTIONAL.  If used, <string> designates a
               string of characters to be added to the command line of the
               configuration file parameters 'Packer,' 'AfterMail' and
               'CleanUp.'  The string should be enclosed in quotation marks.
               For example:   Event All 00:00 01:00 "-sA -c"

               The <string> is appended to the command lines given for these
               options in the configuration file, and should be ignored by
               those that do not need it.  It is suggested that batch files
               be used with the above mentioned configuration file options,
               and that the batch file(s) filter out unneeded information
               given in <string> before calling a program that might "cough"
               because the command line is wrong.
               Up to 32 extra characters can be added with the <string>
               parameter.

          <flags/options>

               This set of parameters tells BinkleyTerm about the event.  The
               various flags and options should be separated by a space.

               C    The 'C' flag tells BinkleyTerm that during this event,
                    only mail marked as Continuous Mail will cause a call to
                    be made.

               N    This flag tells BinkleyTerm not to accept inbound file
                    requests during this event.

               L=   The 'L=' flag is the 'less than or equal to cost' flag.
                    For example, 'L=10' would mean that during this event,
                    only mail with a cost EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 10 cents will
                    be sent (as designated by the nodelist cost field for a
                    particular entry.  Using 'L' alone, without a cost, means
                    that a value of '0' is used, and only mail with no cost
                    may be sent.  This is also called the 'local only' flag
                    when used with no cost parameter, since local calls in
                    most areas are free.

               L<   The 'L<' flag works just like the 'L=' flag, except that
                    it means 'less than cost.'  For example, 'L<10' would
                    indicate that during the designated event, only mail with
                    a cost field of LESS THAN 10 cents will be sent.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

               L>   The 'L>' flag works just like the 'L=' flag, except that
                    it means 'greater than cost.'  For example, 'L>10' would
                    indicate that during the designated event, only mail with
                    a cost field of GREATER THAN 10 cents will be sent.

               M    The 'M' flag indicates that the event is a 'mail' event,
                    and that it is okay to send mail to anyone in the
                    nodelist, regardless of their #CM designation.  This flag
                    is normally used during local mail schedules, and during
                    National Mail Hour.

               R    This flag tells BinkleyTerm that the event is 'Receive
                    Only.'  BinkleyTerm will not dial out to send mail,
                    however, it will send mail if polled for it.

               B    This flag tells BinkleyTerm that BBS operation is allowed
                    during this event.  If this flag is NOT present, callers
                    will be greeted with the message "Processing
                    mail...please hang up."  Use this option at all times (if
                    you run a BBS) except during mail schedules, such as
                    National Mail Hour.

               F    This flag tells BinkleyTerm that the event should be
                    'forced' and will occur at the first possible moment.
                    USUALLY YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE THIS FLAG.  BinkleyTerm
                    will execute the current event anyway if for some reason
                    the start time is bypassed (but before the stop time
                    passes).  If you do use this option, use it only on zero-
                    length events; those events for which the <start_time>
                    and <stop_time> are the same.

               D    This flag tells BinkleyTerm that the event is dynamic.
                    Dynamic events continue until there is no longer any mail
                    of the specified type to be sent.  For example, if the
                    dynamic event specifies that local Continuous Mail is to
                    be sent, the event will continue until there is no more
                    local Continuous Mail to be sent, or until the event
                    ends, whichever happens first.  When the dynamic  event
                    ends, the non-dynamic event scheduled for the same time
                    slot will take over.  If no such event exits, the system
                    will accept mail, but will dial out to no one.  Note that
                    dynamic events must be started before or at the same time
                    as non-dynamic events, if the dynamic event is to overlap
                    a non-dynamic one.

               E1=  The 'E1=' option tells BinkleyTerm what errorlevel to
                    exit with at the beginning of the event.  'E1=10' would
                    tell BinkleyTerm to exit to its start-up batch file with
                    errorlevel 10 when the event begins.  This is a good
                    method of executing functions once daily, for example,
                    message base maintenance software, and so on.  Once the
                    E1= exit has been made, it will not occur again until the
                    next time the event is scheduled.

        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

               E2=  The 'E2=' option tells BinkleyTerm what errorlevel to
                    exit with after mail is received.  The E2= exit is only
                    executed if the incoming mail does not meet the criteria
                    for an E3= exit, or if an E3= exit does not exist.  Using
                    your batch file, the errorlevel set for the E2= option
                    should invoke mail unpacking software to merge the
                    incoming mail with your message base.

               E3=  The 'E3=' option tells BinkleyTerm what errorlevel to
                    exit with after compressed mail is received.  If mail is
                    received during the event, and compressed mail is not a
                    part of the mail received, then an E2= exit is performed.
                    If compressed mail was received (even in conjunction with
                    other mail or files) then the E3= exit is performed.
                    Using your batch file, the errorlevel you set for this
                    option should invoke mail unpacking software that can
                    handle compressed mail and merge it with your message
                    base.

                   Event exits E4-E9 can be followed by a three character
                   string.  If that string is matched in the file extension of
                   a received file, then the designated errorlevel exit will be
                   taken.  For example:

                         E4=100,TIC     (Received .TIC Files Cause Exit 100)
                         E5=100,FLE     (Received .FLE Files Cause Exit 100)
                         E6=110,REQ     (Received .REQ Files Cause Exit 110)
                         E7=120,MO?     (Received .MO? Files Cause Exit 120)

                    The order of exit precedence is as follows:

                         E3
                         E4-E9
                         E2
                         AfterMail

                    When more than one E4-E9 exit applies, the first one is the
                    one taken.

               S    This designates an event which is "send only" meaning that
                    BinkleyTerm will continue to send normally, but will not
                    answer the phone (or if the modem is in auto-answer mode,
                    BinkleyTerm will not respond).

               A=   This allows you to control the amount of time that
                    BinkleyTerm will sit idle between attempting an outgoing
                    call.  The format is "A=x" where x is the number of
                    seconds desired, which can be a long integer
                    (0 to 2^32-1).

                    The average wait between calls is based on +/- 50% of the
                    number specified, i.e., A=60 would yield a wait time in
                    the range of 30 to 90 seconds, 60 being the average.
                    Should the A= parameter not be used, the default value
                    is 120, for an average wait time of between 60 and 180
                    seconds.

               K    This option tells BinkleyTerm not to send to any nodes
                    marked in the nodelist as #CM (accepts Continuous Mail).
                    Note that this option is only valid when an Opus Version
                    6, QuickBBS or TBBS nodelist is in use.

               T=   This option allows you to control the maximum number of
                    call attempts and failed connects that will be acceptable
                    to BinkleyTerm.  The T= option accepts two parameters,
                    and is used in the format "T=x,y" where x is the maximum
                    number of failed connects (carrier established, session
                    fails - a chargeable call in toll situations), and y is
                    the maximum number of call attempts (no answer, no
                    session - generally NOT a chargeable call in toll
                    situations).

                    Generally, the x parameter should be very low, so as not
                    to rack up charges on your phone bill should the call be
                    long distance or another toll call.  The y parameter is
                    generally set rather high, since these calls are usually
                    not charged for.

                    The default x parameter is 3, the default y parameter has
                    not been explicitly specified, but is quite high.

               $    This will kill all the bad call flag files (*.$$?)
                    in all your outbound folders at the start of the event.

          Many of the above options can be used with one another, and in fact
          usually are.  Constructing a working event schedule can be a time
          consuming process requiring a certain amount of trial and error.
          Since the event schedule plays a very important roll on when mail
          will be sent, it should be manipulated VERY carefully to avoid
          having BinkleyTerm make toll calls during high rate periods.

          A sample event schedule is shown in BINKLEY.EVT, contained in the
          distribution package.  Print out the file if desired, but in any
          case, study it carefully and make sure you understand the various
          options before going ahead.

          DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF THE JANUS MAIL PROTOCOL

      NOTE:  Janus is an EXPERIMENTAL protocol.  It is not at this
     writing a documented FTSC standard.  BinkleyTerm 2.40 represented
     the first implementation of Janus in a released software product,
     and is providing its first "real world" testing.  With all of
     this in mind, it is important to understand that Bit Bucket
     Software cannot and does not provide any assurances or guarantees
     that Janus will work for you in your environment.

                    An Introduction to Janus

     Janus is a file transfer protocol specifically designed for WaZOO
     mail transfers.  It can achieve Zmodem-like performance and
     reliability, with the major added benefit of being able to do
     transfers in both directions simultaneously.  It is implemented
     as dual independent state machines; one for sending files, and
     one for receiving files.  Both state machines run simultaneously,
     sharing the phone line.  All data is exchanged in variable-length
     packets, with either a 16 or 32 bit CRC.  Under ideal conditions,
     you can expect Zmodem-class performance going both ways at the
     same time.

     The bottom line is that when two machines exchange mail using
     Janus, the smaller of the two nodes' batches of files will be
     sent for free while the larger batch is being sent.  If you poll
     your EchoMail feed nightly, and usually only send a couple of
     kilobytes while picking up a couple hundred, you won't get any
     real benefit from using Janus.  But if you normally send 100kb
     and pick-up 200kb, you'll see significant time and money savings.

     However, even if you don't usually need to send and receive much
     data at once, and don't get much benefit from the full-duplex
     file transfers, you should get Zmodem-level performance even on
     one-way transfers, and so shouldn't have any penalty for using
     Janus rather than ZedZap (Zmodem).  The idea is for the benefits
     to be there when you need them, without costing you anything
     extra if you don't.

                   What You Should Be Aware Of

     There are some important considerations that you should be aware
     of before using Janus.  Most importantly, Janus is a FULL DUPLEX
     protocol, and works best with a full-duplex connection.  It's not
     a good idea to try and shove streaming, non-stop, full-duplex
     data through a half-duplex connection, since the modems will end
     up constantly flip-flopping the line around and retraining, and
     you'll get terrible performance.

     What this means is that normal low speed (1200 and 2400 baud)
     connections should work fine with Janus, and that high speed
     links that use V.32 should also work fine.  High speed
     connections with high speed in one direction and a low speed back
     channel (such as an HST) will not allow Janus to work well at
     all.

        Reference Guide - Page 40
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

     There are some other situations where Janus will not work very
     well.  Many systems, modems and networks just don't seem to have
     the sustained bandwidth to allow full-duplex streaming data to be
     transferred accurately.

     Telenet's PC Pursuit service is a good example.  The service has
     great difficulty with Janus, frequently dropping and mangling
     data.  Janus simply saturates the capabilities of the packet
     switched connection.

     Some modems and even some serial port hardware doesn't seem to
     bear up very well under the tremendous load Janus can put on them
     either.  This is probably to be expected, since full-duplex
     streaming protocols are rare, and the hardware has probably never
     been tested under this type of extreme, sustained load.

     The bottom line is that Janus may or may not work for you with
     your hardware, and if it does work, it may not work well on all
     connections.  Its implementation in BinkleyTerm has been tested
     thoroughly, and works very well in many cases.  You'll need to
     enable Janus (by default, Janus is not enabled) and test it
     yourself in your own environment to know whether Janus is a
     workable solution for you.

          | Bit Bucket Software cannot guarantee the performance   |

          | for you in your environment, please do not bombard us  |
          | with questions and comments about the protocol; simply |

                        Configuring Janus

     Your first consideration before using Janus is your
     buffer configuration.  Janus really needs at least a 2kb receive
     buffer (or better yet, 3kb) and no more than about a 1kb transmit
     buffer (including whatever transmit buffering your modem does).
     The reason for the large receive buffer may be obvious; the
     largest packet Janus ever sends is 2kb, and while it's sending
     2kb, you can obviously receive 2kb, which Janus won't be able to
     read until it's done sending.  So up to 2kb of
     data can easily be received before Janus gets a chance to read
     any of it, and possibly a bit more in some situations.  If your
     receive buffer is too small, you'll constantly lose incoming data
     and require massive numbers of retransmissions.

     The send buffer should be kept fairly small, because of the way
     the packets for the two directions are interleaved on the phone
     lines.  If I'm receiving a large file from you while I'm sending
     you lots of small files, every time I finish sending you a small
     file I have to wait until I've received your entire send buffer's
     worth of data before I see the acknowledgement that says you
     received my file okay.  If your send buffer is more than 1 or
     2kb, this can end up wasting a lot of time.

                Configuration File Modifications

     IF YOU HAVE A LOW SPEED MODEM (2400 baud or under), then you will
     generally use the 'JanusBaud' statement in your configuration
     file.  Set 'JanusBaud' to your highest supported baud rate.

     IF YOU HAVE A HIGH SPEED MODEM (9600 baud or above), then you
     might need to use a combination of 'JanusBaud' and 'JanusOK'
     statements in your configuration file.  'JanusBaud' should be set
     to the highest FULL DUPLEX baud rate you support.  The only
     exception is if you have a multi-standard modem.  Use the
     following as a guideline:

          Modem Type               JanusBaud Statement
          --------------           -------------------
          V.32 Only                JanusBaud 32767
          Non-V.32 Only            JanusBaud 2400
          Multi-Standard           JanusBaud 2400

     NOTE:  32767 is the maximum setting for 'JanusBaud.'

     If your high speed modem is single-standard, then 'JanusBaud' is
     all you will probably need to use.  Multi-standard modems require
     'JanusOK' statement(s) in order to take full advantage of high
     speed full duplex (V.32) connections when they occur.

     Your multi-standard modem should be set to return extended modem
     connect information.  This information is appended to the end of
     the modem connect message, and can be used to determine what type
     of connection has been made in conjunction with the 'JanusOK'
     statement.

        Reference Guide - Page 42
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

     In the case of a USRobotics HST Dual Standard, you will normally
     want to use Janus on V.32 connects, but not on HST connects.  For
     example, these connect strings would indicate connections where
     Janus can be used:

          CONNECT 9600/Arq/V32
          CONNECT 9600/V32

     But a connection like this would not take advantage of Janus:

          CONNECT 9600/Arq/Hst

     NOTE:  The extended connect information is not shown in all upper
     case, since BinkleyTerm will convert everything but the first
     character to lower case for display, automatically.

     You would permit Janus only on the desired connects, like this:

          JanusOK /Arq/V32
          JanusOK /V32

     Make certain that you also set 'JanusBaud' no higher than 2400,
     or your 'JanusOK' statements may not have the desired effect.  In
     addition, you will probably want to dial out in V.32 mode if you
     frequently connect with multi-standard modems of the same make
     and model.  This will allow Janus to be enabled on the maximum
     number of connections.

     If your multi-standard modem is not an HST Dual Standard, consult
     your modem manual for details extended connect information for
     your particular modem make and model.

     NOTE:  In testing, it has been found that the "PEP" mode of the
     Telebit Trailblazer series modems can handle Janus, even though
     PEP mode is not full duplex.  Throughput may not be as high as it
     would be on a true full duplex connection.

         DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF DOMAIN ADDRESSING

                          Introduction

     Domain addressing is a relatively new concept in FidoNet, and
     represents an alternative, more complete method of designating
     various networks than the zone method now commonly in use.  In
     theory, domain addressing adds an additional "layer" to address
     designation that represents a particular network.  Within that
     network, zones and nets can all be specified without conflict to
     identical zones and nets in other networks.

     Domain support in BinkleyTerm requires you to use separate and
     distinct nodelist files for different domains.  BinkleyTerm can
     now be used much more effectively in multiple network
     installations, assuming all the elements are configured properly.

                       'Address' Statement

     BinkleyTerm will accept a domain designation in any 'Address'
     statement in the configuration file.  A domain is a valid
     Internet domain in most cases.  For example, 1:104/501 might have
     the following in its configuration file:
          Address 1:104/501@fidonet.org

     At this writing, FidoNet is the only FidoNet technology network
     that is listed with Internet, but that is subject to change.
     Alternative networks should be designated by their "common" name
     followed by ".ftn" (for FidoNet technology network).  For
     example, a node in Alternet might be designated as follows:
          Address 7:520/1015@alternet.ftn

                       'Domain' Statement

     There are several elements to successful domain implementation,
     in that nodelist and outbound areas change by domain.  This
     information is given by you in the form of 'Domain' statements in
     your configuration file.

     NOTE: if you have a domain in an 'Address' statement, you must
     also create a corresponding 'Domain' statement.

                      Outbound Area Naming

     The name of the outbound area also changes according the domain.
     As always, the outbound area for your primary address (including
     domain) is given with the 'Hold' statement.

     Outbound areas for other domains take an identical path, except
     the name of the last sub-directory is changed to the
     <abbreviation> parameter.  For example, if your 'Hold' statement
     designates C:\BINKLEY\OUTBOUND for an outbound holding area (and
     you are in FidoNet), Alternet outbound mail would be held in the
     C:\BINKLEY\ALTERNET.xxx directory instead.  Note that outbound
     areas for domains other than your own will ALWAYS have a zone
     extension.

                         Working Example

     If you're thoroughly confused at this point, possibly a working
     example will help.  Assume that a configuration file has the
     following:

          Hold c:\bink\outbound
          Domain fidonet.org fidonet nodelist
          Domain alternet.ftn alternet anetlist
          Domain eggnet.ftn eggnet egglist
          Address 1:104/501@fidonet.org
     The nodelist files would be as follows:

          NODELIST.*     (for FidoNet)
          ANETLIST.*     (for Alternet)
          EGGLIST.*      (for Eggnet)

     The examples of outbound holding areas are as follows:

          c:\bink\outbound         (Default Outbound)
          c:\bink\outbound.002     (FidoNet Zone 2)
          c:\bink\outbound.003     (FidoNet Zone 3)
          c:\bink\outbound.004     (FidoNet Zone 4)
          c:\bink\outbound.005     (FidoNet Zone 5)
          c:\bink\alternet.007     (Alternet Zone 7)
          c:\bink\alternet.059     (Alternet Zone 89)
          c:\bink\eggnet.063       (Eggnet Zone 99)

          COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

          BinkleyTerm offers a selection of command line parameters which
          each have a unique function.  The words that are described below are
          simply placed on the DOS command line - no hyphens or slashes are
          necessary.  For example:
               BT NoForce Unattended Share Config C:\BT\SYS1.CFG

          Here is a list of the command line parameter options:

               NoForce

                    Don't force events that have already passed.

               Mail

                    For Point system use, this causes BinkleyTerm to attempt
                    connection to the boss upon start-up.

               Share

                    Leaves the FOSSIL driver "hot" (does not de-initialize
                    the driver upon exit) for use with other FOSSIL-based
                    systems.

               Dynam

                    Restart the current dynamic event, if any, even if it may
                    have already executed.

               Unattended

                    Run in Unattended Mode, regardless of whether the
                    'Unattended' configuration file statement is used.

               Config

                    Allows specification of a configuration file other than
                    the default (BINKLEY.CFG).  This parameter must be
                    followed by a single space, and then the name of the
                    configuration file, including drive and path if
                    applicable, for example:  "BT Config C:\BT\MYCONFIG.CFG"

               Poll

                    Instructs BinkleyTerm to immediately poll a given node.
                    Upon completion of the poll, BinkleyTerm will exit.  For
                    example:  "BT Poll 1:132/101"

        Reference Guide - Page 46
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide


               Batch
               
                    Binkley runs in Incomming Batch mode.  If there is 
                    carrier present when BinkleyTerm starts up then it will 
                    do an incomming mail session and exit with an 
                    errorlevel.  As well as the errorlevels described 
                    elsewhere there are:
                       -1 or 255 : No carrier
                        0        : session OK but no mail was received





          DIAL TRANSLATION

               When BinkleyTerm is in modem command mode, several dial
               translations take place automatically.

               ASCII  Char.   Name                Action

          RESPONSE FILE TEMPLATE

          Response files are explained in the User's Guide section "Request
          Response Files."

          Response files are generated according to a template file which
          designates exactly what is to be placed in the finished response
          file.  Most options perform simple macro substitution; others allow
          conditional inclusion of text, or instruct BinkleyTerm what to do
          with the response file.

          Response files will be generated according to the template under
          any one of the following cases, called reason codes:

               1 - File Not Found
               2 - No Update Necessary
               3 - Password Missing or Wrong
               4 - Request Number of Files Limit Exceeded
               5 - Start of No-Requests-Honoured Event
               6 - Request Byte Limit exceeded
               7 - Request Time Limit exceeded
               9 - Successful Request

          By default, when a template is designated in the configuration
          file, BinkleyTerm will always generate a response file for all of
          the above reasons.  It is possible, however, to control or limit
          what the response file says based on a particular reason code, or
          to not have a response file generated at all for a particular
          reason code.

          BinkleyTerm uses the template file serially, and copies everything
          found in the template directly to the response file, performing
          substitution or conditional copies as directed by template file
          verbs.  When the end of the template is reached the response file
          is closed and sent to the calling system (unless an %exit verb is
          used before the end of the file).

          All the allowed verbs in the template begin with a percent sign
          (%), a character which should not be used for any other purpose
          within the file.

          Allowed verbs are as follows:

          %;

               When placed in column 1 (far left), designates a comment line.
               When in any other column, designates that remainder of line
               should be ignored.

          %abort

               Don't send response file.




        Reference Guide - Page 48
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          %abort <number>

               When <number> matches the reason code, don't send response file.

          %exit

               Close the response file and send as-is.

          %exit <number>

               When <number> matches the reason code, close the response file
               and send as-is.

          %text <number> <text>

               When %status is given later in the template, <text> is copied
               into the response file if <number> matches the reason code.
               The <text> should be no longer than 255 characters in length,
               and may contain other template verbs such as %system, %date,
               and so on.

          %line <number> <text>

               If <number> matches the reason code, <text> is copied into the
               response directly.  The <text> should not exceed 255
               characters in length, and may contain other template file
               verbs such as %system, %date, and so on.

          %date

               Copies the current date into the response file.

          %time

               Copies the current time into the response file.

          %bink

               Copies the program name and version into the response file.
               For example:
                    BinkleyTerm 3.00

          %mynode

               Copies your node address into the response file.

          %system

               Copies your system name, as given in the BinkleyTerm
               configuration file, to the response file.

          %sysop

               Copies your Sysop name, as given in the BinkleyTerm
               configuration file, to the response file.


        Reference Guide - Page 49
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          %yrnode

               Copies the node address of the calling system into the
               response file.

          %request

               Copies into the response file the actual line from the
               incoming request that prompted the creation of the response
               file.  Normally this is the name of the file that caused the
               response file to be generated.

          %status

               Copies text previously defined for the current reason code
               with the %text verb into the response file.

          A complete sample template file is included with the BinkleyTerm
          distribution package.  Use the file as a base to design your own
          unique file.

          SCRIPTS

          A script is a series of instructions used when dialling a particular
          system.  They allow the system to "look" for particular information
          coming across the line, and act according when the desired
          information is received within a set time limit.  Scripts are
          essentially a mini programming language, and as such, take study
          and practice to use effectively.

          Scripts are stored in a flat ASCII text file, and edited using any
          standard text editor (such as DOS' own EDLIN).  Once written,
          scripts are associated with a particular nodelist entry for use
          each time the given node is dialled.

          Possible applications for scripts include accessing packet switch
          networks, such as GTE/Telenet's PC Pursuit service, that require
          multiple sets of operations to reach the desired destination.

          The use of a script is triggered by the appearance of a file name,
          inside double quotes, in the phone number field of a nodelist
          entry.  For example, instead of seeing 1-303-555-6789 in the
          nodelist data file, you might see "MYSCRIPT.SCR"303-555-6789.
          Notice that the name of the script file is IMMEDIATELY (without
          spaces) followed by the area code and phone number.  The field must
          appear in the format shown, including hyphens.  The area code
          portion of the number can be up to 10 characters long (for use with
          certain long distance carriers).

          Script references can also be placed in your configuration file by
          way of the 'Dial' statement.  See "Configuration File" for details.

          Refer to the documentation for your nodelist processor for
          information on inserting information into the phone number field
          of a nodelist entry.

          The following restrictions apply when using scripts:
               - Any line beginning with anything other than a letter or a
               colon (:) is ignored as a comment.

               - All lines must begin flush left...at the left margin.

               - All keywords that take arguments must be followed by exactly
               ONE space between the keyword and the argument.

               - There should be NO extra characters at the ends of lines.
               This includes space characters.  All characters on a line are
               significant, including any extra spaces that you may have
               inadvertently included.

               - Script commands and script labels are NOT case sensitive.

          Please note that spaces can cause hard-to-track-down problems.
          Spaces are significant characters, meaning they are NOT ignored in
          patterns, etc.  Do not use a space unless you intend to, and do not
          leave any at the ends of lines unless you want them there.

        Reference Guide - Page 51
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Here are the script statements available to you:
          :<label>

               The colon (:) starts a label.  Labels can be up to 20
               characters long.  Control can be passed to the location in the
               script identified by a label using the 'If' and 'Goto' script
               statements.  Up to 50 labels per script are allowed.

          Abort [<start_time> <stop_time>]

               Allows conditional aborting of script execution based on time
               of day.  If used without arguments, it causes unconditional
               aborting of execution.  If arguments are used, script
               execution will abort if the current time is between the hours
               given with <start_time> and <stop_time>.  For example,
               "Abort 8:00 22:00" would make the script abort between the
               hours of 8:00am and 10:00pm.  The hours CAN wrap through
               midnight, "Abort 22:00 3:00" would be an example of this.

          Areacode

               Transmits the areacode portion of the phone number to the
               modem, as shown in the given nodelist entry.

          Baud [<baud_rate>]

               This statement sets the baud rate for the call to the value
               given.  If no <baud_rate> is given, the baud rate as listed
               in the nodelist for this node is used.

          Break [<duration>]

               This causes a "break" signal to be sent, as needed with some
               types of host systems.  <duration> designates the number of
               hundredths of a second for the break signal to last.  If the
               <duration> parameter is not given, the default duration value
               of 100 (1 second) will be used.

          Carrier

               Continue the script if there is carrier, abort if there is not.

          Comm <settings>

               Allows setting of the communications parameters.  <settings>
               is a three-character string, consisting of the number of data
               bits, parity and number of stop bits.  For example, a
               <settings> string of "8N1" would cause the parameters to be
               set to 8 data bits, No parity, and 1 stop bit.  "7E1" would
               cause 7 data bits, Even parity, and 1 stop bit.  "7O2" would
               cause 7 data bits, Odd parity, and 2 stop bits.

               Possible values are 7 or 8 for data bits, E (even), O (odd)
               or N (none) for the parity, and 1 or 2 for stop bits.
               NOTE!  The string is NOT checked for accuracy.  The user is
               responsible for making sure that it is correct!

          Dial

               Dial the entire telephone number, and wait for a valid
               response.  Continue if there is carrier, abort if there is not.

          DOS <command_line>

               Causes the <command_line> to be sent to DOS for execution.
               Upon completion, script execution continues.  Sufficient
               memory must exist for any application executed by this
               command.

          Goto <label>

               This statement causes the script processor to jump to the
               location in the script pointed to by <label>.  A colon (:)
               must have previously been used in the script to identify the
               <label>.  If the label does not exist, the script aborts.

          If <pattern_number> <label>

               If a match for <pattern_number> was found at the last 'Wait'
               statement, transfer control to the point in the script
               identified by <label>.  If a match was not found, control
               continues to the next statement in the script.  'If' can be
               used at any time prior to the next 'Wait' statement.

          NoWaZOO

               Forces BinkleyTerm to be strictly an FSC-0001 mailer by
               disabling WaZOO functionality for the current outgoing session
               only.  This is primarily of interest to coordinators who wish
               to verify that their nodes are meeting FidoNet compatibility
               requirements.
               There is no benefit to the average user from using this
               statement.  In fact, performance with other WaZOO-capable
               mailers (BinkleyTerm, Opus, D'Bridge, FrontDoor, etc.) will
               be adversely affected.

          Pattern <pattern_number> <string>

               This statement establishes a pattern for the script handler
               to look for during the next 'Wait' statement.  <string> IS
               case sensitive.  The script handler will look an EXACT match
               for the series of characters in <string> during the next
               'Wait' statement.  Up to 8 patterns can be used, and they can
               be reused or reset at will.  Up to 20 characters can be used
               in a pattern.
               The purpose is to wait for a given string from the host, or
               a particular modem response string, and to act accordingly.

          Phone

               Transmits the local portion of the phone number to the modem,
               as shown in the given nodelist entry.  Hyphens are stripped
               automatically.

        Reference Guide - Page 53
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Rawxmit <string>

               This works in the same manner as the 'Xmit' statement, except
               that dial translation is NOT performed.

          Session

               This should be used at the end of a script which has been
               successful.  It tells BinkleyTerm to begin a NetMail session
               with the remote system.

          Speed

               Causes BinkleyTerm to send the baud rate divided by 100 as a
               string.  The baud rate used it the rate specified for the node
               in the nodelist, or the rate specified by a prior call to the
               'Baud' statement.  For example, if the current connect rate
               was 2400 baud, the string "24" would be sent when this
               statement is encountered.

          Timer <seconds>

               Sets a master countdown timer to <seconds>.  If the timer
               expires, the script will abort.  This allows you to set
               timeouts on any portion of, or the entire script.  You may
               reset the timer by using another 'Timer' statement.

          Wait [<seconds>] [<label>]

               Wait for a maximum of <seconds> for one of the previously set
               patterns to be matched.  If a pattern is matched, the script
               continues, otherwise it aborts.  If <label> is provided, the
               script will resume operation at the label specified upon
               timeout.  Note that the default value is 40 seconds.  Both
               <seconds> and <label> are optional.  A <label> may be
               specified without specifying <seconds>.  For example:

                    Wait 40 foo

               is the same as:

                    Wait foo

          Xmit <string>

               Transmits <string> to the modem.  Normal BinkleyTerm
               translations are valid (refer to the section "Dial
               Translation" for information).

          In addition to the statements above, the following logical
          variables are also available:

          BPSxxxx

               Allows branching or actions based on baud rate.  For example,
               the statement

                    IF BPS2400 DO2400

               would cause script execution to jump to the previously defined
               label "DO2400" is the current connection was at 2400 bps
               (baud).  Other examples might be "BPS9600" for 9600 bps
               connections, "BPS1200" for a 1200 bps connection, etc.

          TERMINAL MODE KEYSTROKES

          While in Terminal Mode, several keystrokes are available that allow
          uploading and downloading of files, changing of communications
          parameters, and so on.

          Alt-F1 through Alt-F9

               These keystrokes allow you to send user-defined macros.
               Please refer to the section "Configuration File" for
               information on Terminal Mode macros.

          Alt-F10

               This provides a brief help screen, listing the key-presses
               available to you in Terminal Mode.

          Alt-B

               This allows you to step the baud rate up to the next higher
               value.  BinkleyTerm supports baud rates of 300, 1200, 2400,
               4800, 9600, 19,200 and 38,400.  38,400 baud wraps to 300 baud.

          Alt-C

               This allows you to set various communications parameters,
               including number of data bits, parity, and number of stop
               bits.  You are prompted for the information.  Note that when
               8 bits are set, BinkleyTerm defaults to no parity, and you are
               not prompted for the setting.

          Alt-D

               Allows you to dial out.  When prompted, you may enter one of
               three items: a telephone number, a FidoNet node address in the
               form [<zone>:]<net>/<node>, or a FidoNet Sysop name.

               Entering a FidoNet address requires the presence of a compiled
               nodelist, properly referenced in the BinkleyTerm configuration
               file.  Entering a Sysop name requires that your nodelist
               processing software, e.g., ParseLst, has created a compatible
               list named FIDOUSER.LST.  Refer to your nodelist processing
               software documentation for more information about creating
               FIDOUSER.LST.

          Alt-E

               Erases the display screen.

          Alt-H

               Hang-up.  This command toggles the modem's DTR (data  terminal
               ready) line, thereby disconnecting any call in progress.  The
               modem init string is sent to the modem after DTR is toggled.


        Reference Guide - Page 56
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Alt-I

               Re-initializes the modem.
          Alt-J

               Jump to DOS.  Invokes COMMAND.COM to allow for "quick and
               dirty" DOS commands on the fly.  Enter "EXIT" at the DOS
               prompt to return to BinkleyTerm.  BinkleyTerm will
               automatically return to the directory it was run from when
               returning from DOS.

          Alt-L

               Toggle session logging on and off.  The session logging
               function allows you to designate a file or printer, and have
               the entire terminal mode session echoed to the selected file
               or device.

               When first invoked, this command will prompt you for a file
               name.  Type in the desired name of the log file, including
               drive and path designation if desired.  You may also enter a
               printer device name, e.g., PRN, LPT1, LPT2, etc. for printer
               echoing.
               Invoke the command again to end logging to the file or device.

          Alt-M

               Poll a node in the nodelist, by node address.  This command
               requires that mail handling be implemented as described in the
               User's Guide section, "Unattended Mode Overview".

               You are prompted for a FidoNet node address.  Once entered,
               BinkleyTerm will dial the system (if its exists in the
               nodelist) and attempt to exchange mail with the system.  If
               there is outgoing mail to the system, or if mail is waiting
               for you on the remote system, it will be sent during the mail
               session.

          Alt-P

               This command allows you to change the communications port in
               use.  Invoking the command shifts the port number to the next
               higher port.  The number of ports supported is determined by
               your hardware, and by the 'Maxport' statement in the
               configuration file.

          Alt-R

               This allows you to dial out with a "scan list."  Empty
               elements are designated by 'Null.'  Using the function keys
               (or equivalently numbered numeric keys) you can select the
               scan list element you wish to enter.  Enter a telephone
               number, node address or Sysop name, just as you would with the
               Alt-D command.  Press 'Enter' to "store" your entry for that
               element.  When you have stored all the desired elements, press
               'Enter' to begin the dialling process.

        Reference Guide - Page 57
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

               Each number will be dialled in sequence, until a connection is
               made.  After the session is completed, a 'Null' will be stored
               for that element.  Invoke Alt-R again, and press 'Enter' to
               dial the remaining elements.  Press 'Escape' at any time to
               abort the dialling process.

               Note that unless saved, the dialling list is volatile.  Once
               you exit the Terminal Mode, your dialling list will be erased.

               It is possible to save to and retrieve from the disk media up
               to 10 separate lists of entries.  To save a list, press Shift-
               Fn, where 'n' is the number of the list to save.  For example,
               Shift-F3 would save the current list of 10 entries to list
               number 3.  To retrieve a previously saved list, press Alt-Fn,
               where 'n' is the number of the list to retrieve.  For example,
               Alt-F5 would retrieve the 10 entries previous saved as list
               number 5.

          Alt-S

               Invoking this command sends a "break" signal via the modem to
               the remote host.

          Alt-U

               This command is used in Point and BBS installations to shift
               to Unattended Mode.  BinkleyTerm is put into the mailer mode,
               ready to accept calls from remote systems.  In order to
               operate, the mailer functions must be implemented as described
               in the User's Guide section, "Unattended Mode Overview".

          Alt-X

               Allows you to exit the program and return to DOS.  If
               BinkleyTerm was invoked with a batch file, this command will
               cause BinkleyTerm to exit to the batch file with and
               errorlevel of 1.  The batch file must trap this errorlevel,
               and exit accordingly.
               Note that this function DOES leave the DTR (data terminal
               ready) line on the modem 'high.'

          Alt-Y

               Used primarily for Point operations, this function initiates
               a mail session with the host.  This is designed ONLY to work
               with the system listed as your Boss node in the configuration
               file.

               Issuing this keystroke invokes a temporary mailer mode, and
               BinkleyTerm attempts to dial the Boss system to exchange mail.
               Mail handling must be set-up as described in the User's Guide
               section, "Unattended Mode Overview".

               If mail is waiting to be sent to the Boss, or if mail is
               waiting on the Boss system for pickup, it will be sent during
               the mail session.

        Reference Guide - Page 58
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Shift-Arrow Down

               This allows you to download a file from the host with which
               you are connected.  You are prompted for the desired protocol
               to use, and for the required file information, if needed
               (protocol dependent).  If you have the 'Download' statement
               properly implemented in the configuration file, the downloaded
               files will be placed in the directory specified.  Otherwise,
               the file will be saved to the current directory.

          Shift-Arrow Up

               This allows you to send a file to the remote host.  You are
               prompted for the desired protocol to use for the transfer, as
               well as the file information.  You may specify a complete
               drive, path and filename using standard DOS conventions, e.g.,
               C:\PATH\FILENAME.ARC.

               When a batch protocol is used (SEAlink, Telink, or Zmodem),
               wildcards are allowed in the filename.

          UNATTENDED MODE KEYSTROKES

               While in Unattended Mode, several keystrokes are available
               that perform various functions, such as manual polling, call
               forcing, DOS shells, and so on.

          F1 through F10

               These keys cause BinkleyTerm to exit with an errorlevel of 10
               times the function key number pressed.  In other words, F1
               causes an errorlevel 10 exit, F7 would cause an errorlevel 70
               exit.  Your batch file is used to capture and process these
               errorlevels.

          Alt-F1 through Alt-F10

               These keystrokes invoke user-defined DOS shells, to execute
               programs or utilities as desired.  Refer to the section
               "Configuration File" for additional information.

          Help

               This key causes BinkleyTerm to display a brief help screen,
               listing the various keystrokes available to you in the current
               operating mode.

          Alt-A

               Forces Binkley to send the answer string to the modem and
               act as if a RING has been received. For testing and debugging
               purposes.

          Alt-B

               Forces a screen blank to occur.  Any system activity or a
               press of the space bar will reactivate the screen display.

          Alt-C

               Causes information in the Unattended Mode "Today at a Glance"
               window to be "zeroed" out.  The information is NOT stored to
               the BINKLEY.DAY file prior to being zeroed.

          Alt-E or Ctrl-M

               This invokes your message editor/reader, as designated by the
               configuration file parameter 'Reader.'  Refer to the section
               "Configuration File" for more information.

          Alt-F

               This toggles between NiceOutBound and normal mode (which
               is faster)

          Alt-G

               Allows the generation of an outbound file request.  When
               executed, this command will pop-up a window on the screen
               where you will be prompted to provide information
               appropriate to creating a file request.

          Alt-I

               Re-initializes the modem (equivalent to Alt-T/Alt-U in
               previous BinkleyTerm versions).  Also causes BinkleyTerm to
               re-read the outbound mail holding area.

          Alt-J

               This causes BinkleyTerm to exit to DOS and stay resident (DOS
               shell).  This is probably the most efficient method to perform
               a quick DOS command "on the fly."  Enter "EXIT" at the DOS
               prompt to return to BinkleyTerm.  BinkleyTerm will
               automatically return to the directory it was run from when
               returning from DOS.

          Alt-K

               Allows you to kill all mail for a particular node.  When
               executed, you will be prompted for the appropriate
               information.

          Alt-M

               This keystroke allows you to perform a manual mail polling
               operation.  You will be prompted for a FidoNet node address
               in the form <net>/<node>.  You may also enter a Sysop name if
               a FIDOUSER.LST is available to BinkleyTerm in the nodelist
               directory.  Refer to the User's Guide section "Nodelist" for
               more information on FIDOUSER.LST.  BinkleyTerm will then dial
               the system, without regard to event schedules, and attempt to
               transact mail with the remote system.

          Alt-R

               This forces BinkleyTerm to restart the first event that should
               execute at the current time, not including forced events.

          Alt-S

               Allows the generation of an outbound file attach.  When
               executed, this command will pop-up a window on the screen
               where you will be prompted to provide information
               appropriate to creating a file attach.

          Alt-T

               This is used to shift to Terminal Mode on the fly.  By using
               the Alt-U command of the Terminal Mode, you can flip back and
               forth between Terminal Mode and Unattended Mode.

        Reference Guide - Page 61
        BinkleyTerm ST 3.00 - Reference Guide

          Alt-Q

               This tells BinkleyTerm to quit the current event, and start
               the next event that covers the current time period.  If there
               is no such event, Event 0 (the default non-event) will be
               started.  For all practical purposes, nothing happens during
               event 0, however, BinkleyTerm will still accept incoming mail.
               The events can be restarted by the Alt-R command.

          Alt-W

               This command causes the screen to be redrawn with current
               information.  This is handy for situations such as multi-
               tasking that may have caused the BinkleyTerm screen to become
               "trashed."

          Alt-X or Ctrl-Q

               This allows you to exit BinkleyTerm with errorlevel 1.  If you
               are using a batch file, it must capture and act upon the
               errorlevel properly by terminating the batch file.  Refer to
               the User's Guide section "Control" for additional information.


          Alt-Y

               Polls the boss node (same as Alt-Y in Terminal Mode).

          Alt-Z

               Zooms the outbound window showing more information. It will
               return to normal if you press Alt-Z, escape or Return, or if
               you leave it for about a minute or if the modem sends
               something (e.g. RING).

          C

               This forces BinkleyTerm to look at the outbound holding area
               and determine whether anything should be sent right away.  If
               there is something that would not ordinarily be sent during
               the current event, this command will not cause it to be sent.
               Use a manual poll for immediate sending to any system under
               any circumstances.

               Note that BinkleyTerm automatically checks the outbound area
               approximately once every 10 minutes; the automated equivalent
               of this command.

          Esc

               This allows you to either execute an external shell program
               such as Craft or Gulam, or to execute a program directly from
               within BinkleyTerm.  Pressing <Esc> causes a box to pop up.
               If you press return then a shell program is executed as
               specified by the SHELL or COMSPEC environment variables
               (exactly the same as if you had pressed Alt-J).  If you type
               in a complete program path and filename then that program is
               executed.  If you have a resident shell such as Craft
               installed, then whatever you type is passed to the shell
               for execution.

          Space

               This key may be used to abort polls and to unblank the screen
               (when the 'ScreenBlank' option is used).  This key is ignored
               when pressed during BinkleyTerm idle time (waiting for calls).

          Home

               Resort the outbound window.

          Ctrl-C or Ctrl-F

               Allows the flavour of mail to be changed.  Pressing this
               causes a pop-up box to appear, where you may specify an
               address and the flavour of mail to convert from and to.  The
               flavours are:
                 N : Normal
                 C : Crash
                 H : Hold
                 D : Direct
               See section 3.3 of the User's guide for more details about
               mail flavours.

          $

               Kills all the bad connect status files (These are found in the
               Outbound folders with names like '*.$$?').

          VT-100 KEYSTROKES

          As described in the User's Guide, BinkleyTerm can optionally
          provide complete VT-100 terminal emulation.  Part of this support
          is keystroke mapping of the VT-100 keypad.  Shown below is an
          illustration of the VT-100 keypad, and the keystrokes that are
          required in order to emulate the respective key.  The keypad layout
          and functionality should be familiar to VT-100 users.

          Note that BinkleyTerm also allows the use of the arrow cursor
          control keys on the keyboard.  When used with a host that supports
          VT-100 or ANSI, the arrow keys are functional for cursor
          positioning.  One of the more common non-VT-100 applications for
          these keys is with Opus-CBCS' "OPed" full-screen on-line message
          editor, and many of the full-screen external on-line editors used
          with QuickBBS.

          Environment variables

Setting these depends on what shell you use, if you are using Pcommand then
you would use:
  set NAME=value

COMSPEC :
   should be the name of an external shell such as PCOMMAND.PRG unless you
   are using a shell that uses the _shellp system variable (e.g. Gulam or
   Craft).
SHELL :
   is similar to COMSPEC.  Only one of these needs to be defined.  Actually
   there is a difference in that COMSPEC is the name of a shell program
   called when you press Escape, whereas SHELL is a shell used when
   executing an external program or batch file.  If you don't understand
   any of this then you are best off just setting COMSPEC.
BINKLEY :
   is the name of the main directory where BT expects to find its
   configuration files.
TBUF :
   is the size of the Transmitter buffer.  If undefined it will default to
   8192 bytes.  You may need to fiddle with this to get Janus working
   properly (refer to the Janus section).  Smaller values will improve
   error handling, but may slow things down.
RBUF :
   is the size of the receive buffer and defaults to 8192 bytes.  You may
   need to fiddle with this to get Janus working.  If using Janus then the
   buffer should be at least 2K, preferably more.
TZ :
   is the timezone information.  Format is:
       set TZ=aaabbbccc
   aaa is a 3 letter abbreviation for local time, e.g. CET or GMT.
   bbb is a number between -23 and +24 indicating the value that is
       subtracted from GMT to obtain local standard time.
   ccc is optional and is an abbreviation for local daylight savings,
       e.g. BST.
   If not present then Greenwich meantime is assumed.  If you keep your
   system clock at local time then you shouldn't need to be bothered with
   this.
