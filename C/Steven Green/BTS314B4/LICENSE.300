                   BinkleyTerm-ST Licensing Terms

 BinkleyTerm-ST 3.00 is (C) Copyright 1990,1991 Steven W Green.

 Large portions of the source code are (C) Copyright 1987-90 Bit Bucket 
 Software Co., a Delaware Corporation.

 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION AND/OR USE PROHIBITED WITHOUT 
 WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM STEVEN W GREEN.

 
 Non-Commercial distribution and/or use is permitted under the following
 terms:

 
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of BinkleyTerm source,
 documentation, and executable code as you receive it, in any medium,
 provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy a
 valid copyright notice "(C) Copyright 1987-91 Steven W Green and Bit 
 Bucket Software Co."; keep intact the notices on all files that refer to 
 this License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty;  PROVIDE 
 UNMODIFIED COPIES OF THE DOCUMENTATION AS PROVIDED WITH THE PROGRAM; and 
 give any other recipients of the BinkleyTerm program a copy of this 
 License Agreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution 
 fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, but no more than is 
 necessary to recover your actual costs incurred in the transfer. Under no 
 circumstances is BinkleyTerm to be distributed in such a way as to be 
 construed as "value added" in a sales transaction, such as, but not 
 limited to, software bundled with a modem or CD-ROM software collections.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of BinkleyTerm or any portion of
 it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of
 Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
     that you changed the files and the date of any change;

     b) cause the executable code of such modified version to clearly
     identify itself as such in the course of its normal operation;

     c) if the modified version is not a "port", but operates in the
     same hardware and/or software environment as the original
     distribution, make the original version equally available,
     clearly identifying same as the original, unmodified version;

     d) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
     that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of
     BinkleyTerm or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to
     all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this
     License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more
     extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at
     your option); and

     e) send the complete source code modifications to Steven Green at one 
     of the addresses listed below,  for the purpose of evaluation for 
     inclusion in future releases of BinkleyTerm-ST.  Should your source 
     code be included in BinkleyTerm-ST, Steven Green and/or Bit Bucket 
     Software Co. and Steven Green retain all rights for redistribution of 
     their respective parts of the code as part of BinkleyTerm and 
     BinkleyTerm-ST and all derivative works, with appropriate credit given 
     to the author of the modification.
     
     f) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
     transferring a copy, but no more than is necessary to recover
     your actual costs incurred in the transfer, and you may at your
     option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

 3. Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program and
 documentation (or derivative works) on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium does not bring the other program under the scope of
 these terms.

 4. You may copy and distribute BinkleyTerm and its associated
 documentation (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in
 object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2
 above provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
     shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where
     the corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This
     alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
     only if you received the program in object code or executable
     form alone.)

 For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code
 for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not
 include source code for modules which are standard libraries that
 accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs.

 5. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer BinkleyTerm and
 its associated documentation  except as expressly provided under this
 License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense,
 distribute or transfer BinkleyTerm is void and your rights to use the
 program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated.
 However, parties who have received computer software programs from you
 with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so
 long as such parties remain in full compliance, and notify Steven Green 
 and Bit Bucket Software Co. of their intention to comply with this 
 Agreement.

 6. If you wish to incorporate parts of BinkleyTerm into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, please contact
 Steven Green or Bit Bucket Software Co. at one of the addresses listed 
 below.  We have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, 
 but we will usually permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of 
 preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software (as it 
 pertains to Non-Commercial use as provided by this Agreement) and of 
 promoting the sharing and reuse of software.

 7. For the purposes of this document, "COMMERCIAL USE" is defined as
 operation of the software on four or more computers or data lines owned
 by the same for-profit organization. Any organization may operate this
 software under the terms of this Non-Commercial Agreement if operation
 is limited to three or less computers or data lines.
 
 
                                NO WARRANTY

 BECAUSE BINKLEYTERM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO
 WARRANTY.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, STEVEN W GREEN AND BIT 
 BUCKET SOFTWARE CO. AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE BINKLEYTERM-ST "AS IS" 
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
 NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR 
 A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
 OF BINKLEYTERM, AND THE ACCURACY OF ITS ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION, IS WITH 
 YOU.  SHOULD BINKLEYTERM OR ITS ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
 YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 IN NO EVENT WILL BIT BUCKET SOFTWARE CO. BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR
 THE BEHAVIOR OF MODIFIED VERSIONS OF BINKLEYTERM. IN NO EVENT WILL 
 BIT BUCKET SOFTWARE CO. AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND
 REDISTRIBUTE BINKLEYTERM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
 DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
 TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
 INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
 PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) BINKLEYTERM, EVEN IF YOU
 HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM
 BY ANY OTHER PARTY.
