            Ducumentation for the programm Gemfrac ST
                   (c) by Norbert Marschalleck 

You  can  get many Fractal-programms,  but here  two  things  was 
important for me:
At  first the testing of Gem-routines and twice the making  of  a 
Fractal programm which display the whole screen and can save this 
screen.
The  routine for calculating the fractal are not very  fast,  but 
how  i  sad,  i  was testing the  Gem-routines.  One  other  most 
important  thing  was  the  redrawing of  a  window  without  new 
calculating  and this was not very easy,  because only in  a  few 
books the raster-funktions was described.  This one,  who wants a 
faster  calculating can work himself in the Programm or  he  must 
wait for the new version.

The programm is written i Megamax-C, but it must be easy to adapt 
it to an other C-compiler. Look at the inline-Assembler !!!

The programm uses this files:
1.  GEMFRAC.PRG     programm file
2.  GEMFRAC.RSC     RCS file for the programm
3.  TITEL           title picture in doodle format (32KB)

The sourcecode has this componentes:
1.  GEMFRAC.C       C source file
2.  GEMFRAC.H       include file from RCS
3.  GEMFRAC.DEF     definition file for the RCS

The use of the programm must be clear for every ST-owner, because 
of  the  Gem.  But i describe it for every new  ST-owner  or  new 
computer owner. The descriptin of the source code is to involved, 
but it must be clear to understand.

After  starting the programm,  you can see a picture (or  someone 
has stolen thi picture ?) which is scrolling down.  If it is  not 
so  the  programm file can be defect or you are useing  a  reset-
resident ramdisk,  which is moving the screen to an other  memory 
part.  If the last thing is right,  you should start the programm 
without ramdisk from disk.

Now you can see a Window which is titled "Fractal 0" and a  menue 
with the points Desk, View, Command and Options.

Under the point desk you find the following menue points:

About:              Info for the programm.
Accessory1          if it is in use
Accessory2          ...
Accessory3          ...
Accessory4          ...
Accessory5          ...
Accessory6          ...

Under the point view you can find 'as Blowup'.  If you click this 
point the programm will display the fractal to the whole screen.
If the calculating is ended or you stopped it with a key you  can 
change with another key to the right screen.

Under the point Command you find the following menue points:

Regenerate:         display the Fractal onother time.
Save Fractal:       save the Blowup picture
Load Fractal:       load a Blowup picture
Drucke:             print the Blowup picture (hadrcopy)
Quit:               return to desktop

Under the point Options you find the following menue points:

Low:                low iteration
Medium:             medium iteration
Hight:              high iteration

Black-White:        display the Fractal in two colours (BW)
4-Grey:             display the Fractal in 4 Grey modes

To see the 'normal' Fractal (in Germany called Apfelm„nnchen) you 
must (in this Version) select at first regenerate.
To get a part from this Fractal you can get with the mouse a  new 
part (rubberband) and like a miracle a new window opens with  the 
new calculation of this part.
You can open only four windows and can close only the last opened 
window. To look twice at the Blowup you can select the Fuller and 
can return to the right screen with any key.

This for the programm using.

In the next version you can work also in colour and you can  type 
some coordinates for calculating the Fractal.  Some routines  may 
be work faster.
Some  routines  then are using the  line-A-routines,  because  in 
nearer  future  the BLT-chip (Blitter) makes this  routines  very 
fast.

I  hope that some people can use this  programm,  especially  the 
ideas  for  the  programming in Gem.  Also i hope  that  you  can 
understand my bad English.
And now i whish you many fun by reading the other parts of STOP !
