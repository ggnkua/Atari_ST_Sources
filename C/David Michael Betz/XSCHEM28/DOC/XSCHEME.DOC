        XSCHEME                   INTRODUCTION                    Page 3


        XScheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language
        with extensions to support object-oriented programming.

        There are currently implementations of XScheme running on the
        IBM-PC and clones under MS-DOS, on the Macintosh, the Atari-ST
        and the Amiga.  It is completely written in the programming
        language 'C' and is easily extended with user written built-in
        functions and classes.  It is available in source form to non-
        commercial users.

        This document is a brief description of XScheme.  XScheme
        follows the "Revised^3 Report on the Algorithmic Language
        Scheme".  It assumes some knowledge of Scheme or LISP and some
        understanding of the concepts of object-oriented programming.

        I recommend the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
        Programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman and published
        by The MIT Press and the McGraw-Hill Book Company for learning
        Scheme (and programming in general).  You might also find "The
        Scheme Programming Language" by R. Kent Dybvig and "The Little
        Lisper" by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen to be
        helpful.









































        XSCHEME              A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR               Page 4


        A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR

        If you have any problems with XScheme, feel free to contact me
        for help or advice.  Please remember that since XScheme is
        available in source form in a high level language, many users
        have been making versions available on a variety of machines.
        If you call to report a problem with a specific version, I may
        not be able to help you if that version runs on a machine to
        which I don't have access.  Please have the version number of
        the version that you are running readily accessible before
        calling me.

        If you find a bug in XScheme, first try to fix the bug yourself
        using the source code provided.  If you are successful in fixing
        the bug, send the bug report along with the fix to me.  If you
        don't have access to a C compiler or are unable to fix a bug,
        please send the bug report to me and I'll try to fix it.

        Any suggestions for improvements will be welcomed.  Feel free to
        extend the language in whatever way suits your needs.  However,
        PLEASE DO NOT RELEASE ENHANCED VERSIONS WITHOUT CHECKING WITH ME
        FIRST!!  I would like to be the clearing house for new features
        added to XScheme.  If you want to add features for your own
        personal use, go ahead.  But, if you want to distribute your
        enhanced version, contact me first.

        EXPRESSIONS

        <variable>

            An expression consisting of a variable is a variable
            reference.  The value of the variable reference is the value
            stored in the location to which the variable is bound.  It
            is an error to reference an unbound variable.

        (QUOTE <datum>)
        '<datum>

            (quote <datum>) evaluates to <datum>.  <Datum> may be any
            external representation of a Scheme object.  This notation
            is used to include literal constants in Scheme code.  (quote
            <datum>) may be abbreviated as '<datum>.  The two notations
            are equivalent in all respects.

        <constant>

            Numeric constants, string constants, character constants,
            and boolean constants evaluate "to themselves"; they need
            not be quoted.

        (<operator> <operand>...)

            A procedure call is written by simply enclosing in
            parentheses expressions for the procedure to be called and
            the arguments to be passed to it.  The operator and operand
            expressions are evaluated and the resulting procedure is
            passed the resulting arguments.

        (<object> <selector> <operand>...)

            A message sending form is written by enclosing in
            parentheses expressions for the receiving object, the
            message selector, and the arguments to be passed to the
            method.  The receiver, selector, and argument expressions
            are evaluated, the message selector is used to select an
            appropriate method to handle the message, and the resulting
            method is passed the resulting arguments.






















        XSCHEME                   EXPRESSIONS                     Page 6


        (LAMBDA <formals> <body>)

            <Formals> should be a formal argument list as described
            below, and <body>  should be a sequence of one or more
            expressions.  A lambda expression evaluates to a procedure.
            The environment in effect when the lambda expression is
            evaluated is remembered as part of the procedure.  When the
            procedure is later called with some actual arguments, the
            environment in which the lambda expression was evaluated
            will be extended by binding the variables in the formal
            argument list to fresh locations, the corresponding actual
            argument values will be stored in those locations, and the
            expressions in the body of the lambda expression will be
            evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.  The
            result of the last expression in the body will be returned
            as the result of the procedure call.

            <Formals> should have the following form:

                (<var>... [#!OPTIONAL <ovar>...] [. <rvar>])
              or
                (<var>... [#!OPTIONAL <ovar>...] [#!REST <rvar>])

              where:

                <var>    is a required argument
                <ovar>   is an optional argument
                <rvar>   is a "rest" argument

            There are three parts to a <formals> list.  The first lists
            the required arguments of the procedure.  All calls to the
            procedure must supply values for each of the required
            arguments.  The second part lists the optional arguments of
            the procedure.  An optional argument may be supplied in a
            call or omitted.  If it is omitted, a special value is given
            to the argument that satisfies the default-object?
            predicate.  This provides a way to test to see if an
            optional argument was provided in a call or omitted.  The
            last part of the <formals> list gives the "rest" argument.
            This argument will be bound to the rest of the list of
            arguments supplied to a call after the required and optional
            arguments have been removed.

        (IF <test> <consequent> [<alternate>])

            An if expression is evaluated as follows:  first, <test> is
            evaluated.  If it yields a true value, then <consequent> is
            evaluated and its value is returned.  Otherwise, <alternate>
            is evaluated and its value is returned.  If <test> yields a
            false value and no <alternate> is specified, then the result
            of the expression is unspecified.

        (ACCESS <variable> <env>)

            <Env> is evaluated producing an environment.  The result is
            the value of <variable> in this environment.

        (SET! <variable> <expression>)

            <Expression> is evaluated, and the resulting value is stored
            in the location to which <variable> is bound.  <Variable>
            must be bound in some region or at the top level. The result
            of the set! expression is unspecified.

        (SET! (ACCESS <variable> <env>) <value>)

            <Env> is evaluated producing an environment.  <Value> is
            evaluated and the resulting value is stored as the value of
            <variable> in this environment.  The result of the set!
            expression is unspecified.

        (COND <clause>...)

            Each clause should be of the form

                (<test> <expression>...)

            where <test> is any expression.  The last <clause> may be an
            "else clause," which has the form

                (ELSE <expression>...)

            A cond expression is evaluated by evaluating the <test>
            expressions of successive <clause>s in order until one of
            them evaluates to a true value.  When a <test> evaluates to
            a true value, then the remaining <expression>s in its
            <clause> are evaluated in order, and the result of the last
            <expression> in the <clause> is returned as the result of
            the entire cond expression.  If the selected <clause>
            contains only the <test> and no <expression>s, then the
            value of the <test> is returned as the result.  If all
            <test>s evaluate to false values, and there is no else
            clause, then the result of the conditional expression is
            unspecified; if there is an else clause, then its
            <expression>s are evaluated, and the value of the last one
            is returned.






































        XSCHEME                   EXPRESSIONS                     Page 9


        (AND <test>...)

            The <test> expressions are evaluated from left to right, and
            the value of the first expression that evaluates to a false
            value is returned.  Any remaining expressions are not
            evaluated.  If all the expressions evaluate to true values,
            the value of the last expression is returned.  If there are
            no expressions then #t is returned.

        (OR <test>...)

            The <test> expressions are evaluated from left to right, and
            the value of the first expression that evaluates to a true
            value is returned.  Any remaining expressions are not
            evaluated.  If all expressions evaluate to false values, the
            value of the last expression is returned.  If there are no
            expressions then #f is returned.














































        XSCHEME                  BINDING FORMS                   Page 10


        BINDING FORMS

        (LET [<name>] <bindings> <body>)

            <Bindings> should have the form

                ((<variable> <init>)...)

            where each <init> is an expression, and <body> should be a
            sequence of one or more expressions.  The <init>s are
            evaluated in the current envirnoment, the <variable>s are
            bound to fresh locations holding the results, the <body> is
            evaluated in the extended environment, and the value of the
            last expression of <body> is returned.  Each binding of a
            <variable> has <body> as its region.

            If a name is supplied, a procedure that takes the bound
            variables as its arguments and has the body of the LET as
            its body is bound to that name.

        (LET* <bindings> <body>)

            Same as LET except that the bindings are done sequentially
            from left to right and the bindings to the left are visible
            while evaluating the initialization expressions for each
            variable.

        (LETREC <bindings> <body>)

            <Bindings> should have the form

                ((<variable> <init>)...)

            and <body> should be a sequence of one or more expressions.
            The <variable>s are bound to fresh locations holding
            undefined values; the <init>s are evaluated in the resulting
            environment; each <variable>  is assigned to the result of
            the corresponding <init>; the <body> is evaluated in the
            resulting environment; and the value of the last expression
            in <body> is returned.  Each binding of a <variable> has the
            entire letrec expression as its region, making it possible
            to define mutually recursive procedures.  One restriction of
            letrec is very important:  it must be possible to evaluate
            each <init> without referring to the value of any
            <variable>.  If this restriction is violated, then the
            effect is undefined, and an error may be signalled during
            evaluation of the <init>s.  The restriction is necessary
            because Scheme passes arguments by value rather than by
            name.  In the most common uses of letrec, all the <init>s
            are lambda expressions and the restriction is satisfied
            automatically.

            SEQUENCING

            (BEGIN <expression>...)
            (SEQUENCE <expression>...)

                The <expression>s are evaluated sequentially from left
                to right, and the value of the last <expression> is
                returned.  This expression type is used to sequence side
                effects such as input and output.






















































        XSCHEME                DELAYED EVALUATION                Page 12


            DELAYED EVALUATION

            (CONS-STREAM expr1 expr2)

                Create a cons stream whose head is expr1 (which is
                evaluated immediately) and whose tail is expr2 (whose
                evaluation is delayed until TAIL is called).  To use
                CONS-STREAM, enter the following access procedures:

                    (define head car)
                    (define (tail stream) (force (cdr stream)))

            (DELAY <expression>)

                Evaluating this expression creates a "promise" to
                evaluate <expression>  at a later time.

            (FORCE promise)

                Applying FORCE to a promise generated by DELAY requests
                that the promise produce the value of the expression
                passed to DELAY.  The first time a promise is FORCEed,
                the DELAY expression is evaluated and the value stored.
                On subsequent calls to FORCE with the same promise, the
                saved value is returned.

            ITERATION

            (WHILE <test> <expression>...)

                While is an iteration construct.  Each iteration begins
                by evaluating <test>; if the result is false, then the
                loop terminates and the value of <test> is returned as
                the value of the while expression.  If <test>  evaluates
                to a true value, then the <expression>s are evaluated in
                order for effect and the next iteration begins.

            DEFINITIONS

            (DEFINE <variable> <expression>)

                Define a variable and give it an initial value.

            (DEFINE (<variable> <formals>) <body>)

                Define a procedure.






















































        XSCHEME                  LIST FUNCTIONS                  Page 15


            LIST FUNCTIONS

            (CONS expr1 expr2)

                Create a new pair whose car is expr1 and whose cdr is
                expr2.

            (CAR pair)

                Extract the car of a pair.

            (CDR pair)

                Extract the cdr of a pair.

            (CxxR pair)
            (CxxxR pair)
            (CxxxxR pair)

                These functions are short for combinations of CAR and
                CDR.  Each 'x' is stands for either 'A' or 'D'.  An 'A'
                stands for the CAR function and a 'D' stands for the CDR
                function.  For instance, (CADR x) is the same as (CAR
                (CDR x)).

            (LIST expr...)

                Create a list whose elements are the arguments to the
                function.  This function can take an arbitrary number of
                arguments.  Passing no arguments results in the empty
                list.

            (LIST* expr...)

                Create a list whose elements are the arguments to the
                function except that the last argument is used as the
                tail of the list.  This means that the call (LIST* 1 2
                3) produce the result (1 2 . 3).

            (APPEND list...)

                Append lists to form a single list.  This function takes
                an arbitrary number of arguments.  Passing no arguments
                results in the empty list.

            (REVERSE list)

                Create a list whose elements are the same as the

                Compute the length of a list.

            (MEMBER expr list)
            (MEMV expr list)
            (MEMQ expr list)

                Find an element in a list.  Each of these functions
                searches the list looking for an element that matches
                expr.  If a matching element is found, the remainder of
                the list starting with that element is returned.  If no
                matching element is found, the empty list is returned.
                The functions differ in the test used to determine if an
                element matches expr.  The MEMBER function uses EQUAL?,
                the MEMV function uses EQV?  and the MEMQ function uses

            (ASSOC expr alist)
            (ASSV expr alist)
            (ASSQ expr alist)

                Find an entry in an association list.  An association
                list is a list of pairs.  The car of each pair is the
                key and the cdr is the value.  These functions search an
                association list for a pair whose key matches expr.  If
                a matching pair is found, it is returned.  Otherwise,
                the empty list is returned.  The functions differ in the
                test used to determine if a key matches expr.  The ASSOC
                function uses EQUAL?, the ASSV function uses EQV?  and
                the ASSQ function uses EQ?.

            (LIST-REF list n)

                Return the nth element of a list (zero based).

                value returned by this procedure is unspecified.

            (GENSYM [sym|str|num])

                Generate a new, uninterned symbol.  The print name of
                the symbol will consist of a prefix with a number
                appended.  The initial prefix is "G" and the initial
                number is 1.  If a symbol is specified as an argument,
                the prefix is set to the print name of that symbol.  If
                a string is specified, the prefix is set to that string.
                If a number is specified, the numeric suffix is set to
                that number.  After the symbol is generated, the number
                is incremented so subsequent calls to GENSYM will
                generate numbers in sequence.

            (GET sym prop)

                Get the value of a property of a symbol.  The prop
                argument is a symbol that is the property name.  If a
                property with that name exists on the symbols property
                list, the value of the property is returned.  Otherwise,
                the empty list is returned.

                Set the value of a property of a symbol.  The prop
                argument is a symbol that is the property name.  The
                property/value combination is added to the property list
                of the symbol.

                Recursively compares two objects to determine if their

                Compares two objects to determine if they are the same
                object.  Returns #t if they are the same and #f
                otherwise.  This function does not compare the elements
                of lists, vectors or strings but will compare all types
                of numbers.

            (EQ? expr1 expr2)

                Compares two objects to determine if they are the same
                object.  Returns #t if they are the same and #f
                otherwise.  This function performs a low level address
                compare on two objects and may return #f for objects
                that appear on the surface to be the same.  This is
                because the objects are not stored uniquely in memory.
                For instance, numbers may appear to be equal, but EQ?
                will return #f when comparing them if they are stored at
                different addresses.  The advantage of this function is
                that it is faster than the others.  Symbols are
                guaranteed to compare correctly, so EQ? can safely be
                used to compare them.

            All four of the following OPEN functions take an optional
            argument to indicate that file I/O is to be done in binary
            mode.  For binary files, this argument should be the symbol
            BINARY.  For text files, the argument can be left out or the
            symbol TEXT can be supplied.

            (OPEN-INPUT-FILE str ['binary])

                Opens the file named by the string and returns an input
                port.

            (OPEN-OUTPUT-FILE str ['binary])

                Creates the file named by the string and returns an
                output port.

                Returns the current file position as an offset in bytes
                from the beginning of the file.

            (SET-FILE-POSITION! port offset whence)

                Sets the current file position as an offset in bytes
                from the beginning of the file (when whence equals 0),
                the current file position (when whence equals 1) or the
                end of the file (when whence equals 2).  Returns the new
                file position as an offset from the start of the file.

            (GC [ni vi])

                Invokes the garbage collector and returns information on
                memory usage.  If ni and vi are specified, they must be
                integers.  Node and vector space are expanded by those
                amounts respectively and no garbage collection is
                triggered.  GC returns an array of six values: the
                number of calls to the garbage collector, the total
                number of nodes, the current number of free nodes, the

                This makes it possible to examine data structures that
                have the same internal representation as pairs and
                vectors.  It is *very* dangerous to modify objects using
                these functions and there is no guarantee that future

                OBJECT REPRESENTATIONS

                This version of XScheme uses the following object
                representations:

                    Closures are represented as pairs.  The car of the
                    pair is the compiled function and the cdr of the
                    pair is the saved environment.

                    Compiled functions are represented as vectors.  The
                    element at offset 0 is the bytecode string.  The
                    element at offset 1 is the function name.  The
                    element at offset 2 is a list of names of the
                    function arguments.  The elements at offsets above 2
                    are the literals refered to by the compiled
                    bytecodes.

                    Environments are represented as lists of vectors.
                    Each vector is an environment frame.  The element at
                    offset 0 is a list of the symbols that are bound in
                    that frame.  The symbol values start at offset 1.

                    Objects are represented as vectors.  The element at
                    offset 0 is the class of the object.  The remaining
                    elements are the object's instance variable values.
