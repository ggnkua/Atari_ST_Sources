THE USUAL DISCLAIMER

I've tried to ensure that this program is safe to use but I cannot 
ensure that it will never give any problems and it is supplied 
without warranty of any kind. You use this program at your own risk 
and by using the program you imply your acceptance of these 
conditions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have used Kevin Millicans excellent shareware program TUC.TTP
you will have noticed that it is impossible to give full pathnames for 
the three files required on the GEM parameter box. This shell is a 
simple GEM wrapper to use the fileselector to obtain the 3 pathnames 
and send them to TUC.TTP which does all the hard work.

All you need to do is put TUCSHELL.PRG and TUCSHELL.RSC in the same 
folder as TUC.TTP and double click on TUCSHELL.PRG as usual.
From the dialogue box you can either set the 3 pathnames by hand, or 
click on the <source>,<destination> and <tucfile> boxes and use the 
fileselector, which will have a title to tell you whether you are 
selecting the sourcefile,the destination file, or the tucfile. When 
you have selected all 3, click on <ok> or press <return> to set 
TUC.TTP going. When you've finished click on <cancel> to exit.
