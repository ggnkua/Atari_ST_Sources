                        dxed instructions

     DXED is a program that was ment to be used with a TX2-16 or a 
TX8-16 FM tone generator manufactured by Yamaha.   This program is 
somewhat  straight  forward to use,  but a little  instruction  is 
probably best to give.

     I. MENU

     This  section covers what the menu selections do on the  menu 
bar which is just about all you need to know on how to operate the 
program.

          A. DESK

     DESK is the standard desk accessory pop down menu that is  on 
all GEM applications.   The accessories that will be present  will 
depend on which *.acc files were present in the root directory  of 
the boot drive at system reset.

               1. About DX Edit

     This  selection contains the REVISION number of  the  program 
which  will  be  important for determining  how  far  behind  your 
program is compared to the present release.   The current  release 
is Version 0.91.

          B. FILE

     FILE is used for getting the data that will be worked upon or 
to save data that has been modified to the disk.

               1. OPEN

     Open is used to get new data into the machine.   When open is 
selected,  you have three choices,  Open from disk file, Open from 
the  synthesizer or make a fresh start.   When you pick open  from 
disk file you will get the standard GEM file selector BOX.  Refere 
to  your  atari  manual for info on  how  this  works.   One  hint 
however,  when you want to change drives,  get the cursor onto the 
top line where it says something like "A:\*.VCE".   Use the  arrow 
keys to move the cursor over to the A and use the Backspace key to 
erase and then change the A to what you need.   Now move the mouse 
arrow over to the "UP" arrow in the window with the file names and 
click on the "UP" arrow.  The computer will then change to the new 
drive.
     After  you have read in the file,  you will then get a  voice 
selector box with all the voices displayed by name.   Click on the 
voice  that you want and then click on the OK  button.   When  you 
return you will see the voice you have selected.

     When you use the open from synthesizer option,  the  computer 
will read in the BULK data buffers in the synthesizer and then  go 
to the before described voice selector box.

     The NEW option will clear out the internal BULK buffers.

               2. NEW

     NEW  will only clear out the voice you are currently  working 
with.   It resets only the EDIT buffers in the synthesizer and the 
program, but not the BULK buffers.

               3. SAVE

     Save  is  used  to save the BULK buffers  to  the  DISK.   It 
outputs  the  voice  data into files of the  form  *.vce  and  the 
performance  buffers  goto  *.per.   Use  this  with  care.   This 
function  does not take the data that is in the EDIT  buffers  and 
save them to the disk.  You must go to the EDIT menu selection and 
use  the  "SAVE VOICE" function to put the EDIT buffers  into  the 
BULK buffers.

               4. ARRANGE

     Arrange is one of the more useful functions.   This  function 
displays all the voices that are in the current BULK buffers.   If 
you wish to move them around a bit,  just click on the first voice 
you want to move,  then click on the voice whose position you want 
to swap it with.  This may seem a bit tedeous, but, it goes rather 
quickly  and soon you will have all the voices put where you  want 
them.
     Also,  if there is a voice in a different bank that you  wish 
to use,  you can click on the position that you want to load  that 
voice to, then click on the "load voice" option and you will get a 
file selector box for selecting the bank that contains that voice.
After you have selected the bank you want,  you will then get  the 
voice  selector dialog box,  and you just pick the voice as  above 
and you will see the name appear in the arrange box.  You can also 
save  the bank you have arranged right from this  dialog  box,  as 
well as load a whole new bank.   Loading a new bank will wipe  out 
the old one.

               5. QUIT

     Quit  allows you to exit back to the desktop.   You can  also 
click on the dot in the upper left hand corner of the window to do 
the same thing.

          B. EDIT

     The EDIT menu allows manipulation of the Edit buffers in  the 
computer.

               1. Edit VOICE

     This  selection  allows you to select a new  voice  to  edit.  
This  is done with a slider control and is by voice  number  only.  
Not  quite  so slick,  but is mostly intented for use  during  the 
editing of new voices.

               2. Save VOICE

     This selection will put the data in the EDIT buffers into the 
bulk buffers.  Unless you do this, any edits you have done will be 
lost  forever.   It is a good idea to do this before  anything  is 
done that can alter the edit buffers.
