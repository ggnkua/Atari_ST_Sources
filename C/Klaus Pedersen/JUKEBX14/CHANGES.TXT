          THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED IN THE JUKEBOX SINCE V1.1

o  I have changed to a Amiga-PROTRACKER sequencer. This isn't written
   by me - unlike the old NOISETRACKER sequencer. So there might be 
   more bugs that usally (also because there was some things that
   I couldn't resist to to fix ,-).
o  Shuffle (Multi MOD play) of files in a directory.
o  Can load [and start] a MOD at boot time.
o  Can start Shuffle of a directory [and start it] at boot time.
o  When program is started as program it now opens a minimal
   menubar, so that it is possible to access the Sound.CPX.
o  When installed as GTP program, it accepts things like '*.MOD' and
   'O:\mymusic\mine.MOD yours.MOD'.
o  The Jukebox don't use a window when the music is playing in the
   background.
o  You can install it on the desktop and drop multiple file on the
   icon, and The Jukebox will enable Shuffle automatically.
o  The Jukebox knows the ARGV standard for passing long parameter
   lists. 
o  Silent recover - from 'too little computer time'.
o  The 'too little computer time' dialog is now non-modial, and only
   active inside the Jukebox window.
o  Repeat of MOD or MOD's in shuffle mode.
o  Keyboard shortcuts for Pause,Play,Next and Previous.
o  Can optionally reset the filter/volume chip at boot.
o  Can optionally Fade a MOD file out.
o  The error checking of the sample start, end and loop position, 
   is now optionally.  
o  Channels are swapped. Left are voices 2+3, and right are Voices 1+4
o  MultiTOS compatible, when started as a program
o  Now compatible with Quick ST (I think).
o  A bug that would make the jukebox load music into non-existent
   memory (or to little memory) have been fixed! 
   

          THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED IN THE JUKEBOX SINCE V1.4

o  The LIST_MOD program now writes the "Volume Label" if it is present
   and directory. 
o  In Shuffle mode the Jukebox now writes both how many modules that
   it can shuffle, and the number of the current module. 
o  Menu's don't "spring" back when you select a menu - this is usefull
   when setting the flags.

The next version of the Jukebox will use the capabilities of the 
Falcon!

/ / Shuffle of files in a directory / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable Shuffle write "SHUFFLE.MOD" or "SHUFFLE.SEG" in the 
fileselector instead of selecting a file.
When SHUFFLE is selected a number appears in the upper right corner of
the Jukebox window. You can move around in the list with the left and
right arrows.

Shortcuts:         ->      - NEXT FILE.
                   <-      - PREVIOUS FILE.
                   INSERT  - START PLAYING.
                   HELP    - PAUSE.
         

---------------------------------------------------------------------
/ / Silent recover  / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Enable Silent recover in the 'Options/More Options/Silent recover' menu. 
(default is silent recover.)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
/ / Repeat  / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Enable repeat in the 'Options/Repeat' menu. If Shuffle and repeat are
active, then The Jukebox will play all MOD's in the list and start from
the start after the last MOD have been played.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
/ / The Jukebox as a program  / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------
When installed as GTP (GEM Take Parameters) program, then you can pass
things like 
	
    b*.MOD,
    M:\mymusic\mine.mod  *q.mod
    M:\mymusic\mine1.mod M:\mymusic\mine2.mod M:\mymusic\mine3.mod
    M:\mymusic\mine1.mod mine2.mod            mine3.mod

It is infact only the first file-path that is used! In the 2. example
the files 'mine.mod' and all files that match '*q.mod' are loaded from
the 'mymusic' directory.
Then what directorys are used in the 1. example? Well, if you have 
saved the settings ('JUKEBOX.CFG') then it will load all files that
match 'b*.MOD' from your normal *tracker* directory. If you haven't
then The Jukebox uses the *current* directory (the directory where
you have the program).

You can also drop MOD-files on the program icon. This will start The
Jukebox and enable shuffle of the files.

The Jukebox can stil be installed to take '*.MOD' and '*.SEG' files.
  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
/ / Auto Load [& start] / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you 'Save Settings' with a MOD loaded or SHUFFLE enabled, then The
Jukebox will start that way the next time it is started. If the Jukebox
is playing, then it will start to play after loading the first MOD.

Note that this also work when the Jukebox is set to take MOD's from the
desktop. If you save settings while the Jukebox is playing, then it will
load and play the file you double clicked on or dropped on the jukebox
icon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
/ / IRQTIMER PROGRAM  / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This program can be used to messure the time used by any IRQ driven
program, like fx The Jukebox or the Mouse handler...

Start IRQTIMER, then start the program you want to messure, and then
select the 'Messure' menu. The program will now every 500 mS messure
the time used by the IRQ routines. The result is output in % of a
unloaded maschine.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
/ / LIST_MOD PROGRAM  / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------
LIST_MOD.TTP, is a program that list all MODs in a directory, if it is
called without parametes the output goes to the screen. If it is called
with '>list' then the output goes to the file 'list'.
