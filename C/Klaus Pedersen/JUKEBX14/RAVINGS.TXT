
           THE JUKEBOX COMPARED TO THE OTHERS


The Jukebox always play the MOD at the correct speed - the timing is
always correct, even if the sound is awful.

The Jukebox doesn't use any timer. (it uses self-timed DMA).
 - more compatible with other programs.

The Jukebox doesn't use the V-blank for timings.
 - MOD's are played at correct speed in all resolutions.
 
All players in the Jukebox (even the 'Fastest') have the following
features:
     o  Can play MOD's with samples larger than 32 Kbyte
     o  Always have full volume control (when needed).
     o  Can play the MOD in mono, instead of that sick 
        Amiga Stereo (or dual mono).

All Original NoiseTracker 2.0 commands supported.

The Jukebox stops gracefully when there is going too much on. This 
have been fixed in the new version so that it is more insensible to 
'dynamic time hocks' like the mouse handler... 
It can even be disabled, so that the music always play!

The Jukebox can 'shuffle' a directory full of MOD's.

The Jukebox remember where you have your MOD's, and your faurite
player and frequency.
