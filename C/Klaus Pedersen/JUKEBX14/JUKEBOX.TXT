You should check that you have the following files in the JUKEBOX
directory:
   JUKEBOX\
      \TOOL.SRC            ; source to IRQTIMER, MOD_PEEK and LIST_MOD
      \DOC\
         JUKEBOX.TXT       ; This file.
         RAVINGS.TXT       ; About the other players.
         CHANGES.TXT       ; Quick index to changes.
         OK_MODS.TXT       ; List of Modules that I have checked.

      JUKEBOX.PRG          ; JUKEBOX.ACC with a .PRG extension

      LIST_MOD.TTP         ; Program that list all MODs in a directory
      IRQTIMER.PRG         ; Program to messure time used by IRQ

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jukebox is a program to play Noisetracker modules (MOD's) and SEGM
files in the background. Tracker MOD's is a popular music format on
the amiga. This program emulates the amiga hardware.

The 'Noisetracker' player build into Jukebox is fully compatible with
NoiseTracker v2.0 on the amiga (except that you can't flip the
power-on LED ;-) ).

SEGM files was first used in the PD program NT_COMP. NT_COMP can be
used to convert 'MOD' files into SEGM format. SEGM files don't use
the processor (much) when playing, that can NOT be said about a 'MOD'
player...

Jukebox should run on all Atari computers with DMA sound - read
[MEGA] STe and TT computers, but not old ST's, BOOK and PAD.

/ / / / / / / / INSTALATION / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The program can be used in 3 ways:
	- as an accessory
	- installed to take *.MOD, *.SEG or as a GTP program (TOS ò 2.0)
	- started as a normal program.

The program can only play in the background when the program is
installed as an accessory.


MEMORY

When the program is used as a accesory it let you allocate memory for
the music files while you are on the Desktop. When you load a file
from the desktop, you automaticly allocate resident memory for it. If
you load a file while an other program is running (not the Desktop),
then it will be put into resident memory if it fits there, otherwise
it won't be loaded!

Under the menu 'Options/Keep' can you see how much memory you have
resident. It is also possible to change the amount of memory to
'Keep' by hand, simply by using the up and down arrows. Notice that
the memory isn't allocated before you click on the number! Next to
the up and down arrows are an close-icon, click on this to release
all resident memory.

If you choose the menu 'File/Free & Lock!' then ALL memory that the
Jukebox is using will be released. (except the program itself)
If you try to open the Jukebox again you will get a dialogbox that 
says something like :

            !!!  The Jukebox is LOCKED! You
            !!!  can only reopen it on the
             !   Desktop. Press 'Unlock' to
             O   override the protection.
                   [  OK  ] [ Unlock ]

If you choose 'Unlock' then the Jukebox will allocate memory and make
the program you run the new 'desktop' - the place where it will let
you allocate resident memory. Use this with care, because if you
terminate that program while the music is playing you have serious
problems (well, bombs).

Hint: This can be used together with gemini and neodesk:
      Boot, 'Free & Lock' the Jukebox, start Gem Shell, open
      the Jukebox and 'Unlock'.


SAVE SETUP

When you boot the system then the Jukebox will search for a file
called 'JUKEBOX.CFG', if it finds the file it will remember where it
was and read the setup. In the config file there is the path to your
modules and prefered playback frequency, amount of resident memory,
player and such. If you choose the menu 'Save Setup', then the
Jukebox will save the config file at the place it was found at boot
time.


PLAYERS

I have build 6 players into the Jukebox, these have differend strong
points. Interpolation gives the best sound, but it is only sane on an
TT. The TT can play interpolation at 50KHz. The STe can play at
6.25KHz (until you vriggle the mouse). The other players plays well
on a STe (at 12.5KHz) and the 'Fastest' can play at 25KHz.

                     Speed   Quality
Mono, Good S/N       : 1,      good sound.
Interpolation Mono   : 0,      very good sound.
Fastest Mono         : 3,      crappy sound.

Stereo, Good S/N     : 1,      good sound.
Stereo, No Clipping  : 2,      good sound, a bit lower volume (6dB).
Stereo, Interpolation: 0,      very good sound.

Speed = 0..3 where 0 is slow and 3 is fast.
All players use full volume and frequency on all voices (even the
fast one).


NOTE, IMPORTANT

And just one other thing, don't change rez with the music playing.
(Please...).



WHAT DO *I* DO?
---------------
I would like you to contribute with : Ideas (for further developments)
and code that you think needs to be included (I need compression code,
filters and such). If this program shall improve and grow, then I need
your help! Send in BUG-reports (I can't test the program on your
computer - I need your help to do that!). If there is a thing you
think is ackward or silly let me know, _DO_NOT_ say "this is obvious,
someone else have told him", tell me yourself!

If you find BUGs then _please_ send them to me with the following
information:
  o  Computer (STe, TT, MEGA STe, SST)
  o  Memory.
  o  Extra Hardware (PC emulator, Speed up card).
  o  TOS version.
  o  Programs in the Auto folder
  o  Accesorys.

There are 3 ways to contact me :

and I don't understand a word Basic. You can fill in with
Scandinavian, English and Modern (Computer) German...
