                              A MEANINGFUL DIALOG

    This issue of ST PRO GEM begins an exploration of ST GEM's dialog
    handler.  I will discuss basic system calls for presenting the dialog,
    and then continue with techniques for initializing and reading on/off
    button and "radio" button objects.  We  will also take some short
    side-trips into the operation of the GEM Resource Construction Set to
    assist you in building these dialogs.

    There are a number of short C routines which accompany this column.
    These are stored as file GEMCL3.SRC.


                                DEFINING TERMS

    A dialog box is an "interactive form" in which the user may enter text
    and indicate selections by pointing with the mouse. Dialogs in GEM are
    "modal", that is, when a dialog is activated other screen functions
    such as menus and  window controls are suspended until the dialog is
    completed.

    In most cases, the visual structure of a GEM dialog is specified within
    your application's resource file.  The GEM Resource Construction Set
    (RCS) is used to build a picture of the dialog.

    When the RCS writes out a resource, it converts that picture into a
    tree of GEM drawing objects and stores this data structure within the
    resource.  Before your application can  display the dialog, it must
    load this resource file and find the  address of the tree which defines
    the dialog.

    To load a resource, the AES checks its size and allocates memory for
    the load.  It then reads in the resource, adjusting internal pointers
    to reflect the load address.  Finally, the object sizes stored in the
    resource are converted from characters to pixels using the system font
    size.

    (A note for those with Macintosh experience:  Although Mac and GEM
    resources share a name, there are fundamental differences which can be
    misleading.  A Mac resource is a fork within a file; a GEM resource is
    a TOS file by itself.  Mac resources may be paged in and out of memory;
    GEM resources are monolithic.  GEM resources are internally tree
    structured; Mac resources are not.  Finally, Mac resources include font
    information, while ST GEM does this with font loading at the VDI
    level.)



                                    Page 1







    The resource load is done with the GEM AES call:


       ok = rsrc_load(ADDR("MYAPP.RSC"));

    "MYAPP" should be replaced with the name of your program. Resources
    conventionally have the same primary name as their application, with
    the RSC extent name instead of PRG.  The ok flag returned by rsrc_load
    will be FALSE is anything went wrong during the load.

    The most common causes of failure are the resource not being in the
    application's subdirectory, or lack of sufficient memory for GEM to
    allocate space for the resource.  If this happens, you must terminate
    the program immediately.

    Once you have loaded the resource, you find the address of a dialog's
    object tree with:


       rsrc_gaddr(R_TREE, MYDIALOG, &tree);

    Tree is a 32-bit variable which will receive the address of the root
    node of the tree.

    The mnemonic MYDIALOG should be replaced with the name you gave your
    dialog when defining it in the RCS.  At the same time that it writes
    the resource, RCS generates a corresponding .H file containing tree and
    object names.  In order to use these mnemonics within your program, you
    must include the name file in your compile:  #include "MYAPP.H"


                                  BUG ALERT!

    When using the DRI/Alcyon C compiler, .H files must be in the
    compiler's home directory or they will not be found.  This is
    especially annoying using a two floppy drive ST development system. The
    only way around this is to explicitly  reference an alternate disk in
    the #include, for instance:  "B:MYAPP.H"

    Now that the address of the dialog tree has been found, you are ready
    to display it.  The standard (and minimal) sequence for doing so is
    given in routine hndl_dial() in the download.  We will now walk through
    each step in this procedure.

    The form_center call establishes the location of the dialog on the
    screen.  Dialog trees generated by the RCS have an undefined origin
    (upper-left corner).

    Form_center computes the upper-left location necessary to center the
    dialog on the screen, and inserts it into the OB_X and OB_Y fields of
    the ROOT object of the tree.  It also computes the screen rectangle
    which the dialog will occupy on screen and writes its pixel coordinates
    into variables xdial, ydial, wdial, and hdial.

    There is one peculiarity of form_center which occasionally causes



                                    Page 2







    trouble.  Normally the rectangle returned in xdial, etc., is exactly
    the same size as the basic dialog box.

    However, when the OUTLINED enhancement has been specified for the box,
    form_center adds a three pixel margin to the rectangle returned. This
    causes the screen area under the outline to be correctly redrawn later
    (see below).  Note that OUTLINED is part of the standard dialog box in
    the RCS.  Other enhancements, such as SHADOWED or "outside" borders are
    NOT handled in this fashion, and you must compensate  for them in your
    code.

    The next part of the sequence is a form_dial call with a zero
    parameter.  This reserves the screen for the dialog action about to
    occur. Note that the C binding given for form_dial in the DRI documents
    is in error: there are nine parameters, not five.  The first set of
    xywh arguments is actually used with form_dial calls 1 and 2 only, but
    place holders must be supplied in all cases.

    The succeeding form_dial call (parameter one) animates a "zoom box" on
    the screen which moves and grows from the first screen rectangle given
    to the second rectangle, where the dialog will be displayed.

    The use of this call is entirely optional.  In choosing whether to use
    it or not, you should consider whether the origin of the "zoom" is
    relevant to the  operation.  For instance, a zoom from the menu bar is
    relatively meaningless, while a zoom from an object about to be edited
    in the dialog provides visual feedback to the user, showing whether the
    correct object was chosen.

    If the origin is not relevant, then the zoom is just a time-waster. If
    you decide to include these effects, consider a "preferences" option in
    your app which will allow the experienced and jaded user to turn them
    off in the interests of speed.

    The objc_draw call actually displays the dialog on the screen. Note
    that the address of the tree, the beginning drawing object, and the
    drawing depth are passed as arguments, as well as the rectangle
    allotted for the dialog.

    In general, dialogs (and parts of dialogs) are  ALWAYS drawn beginning
    at the ROOT (object zero).  When you want to draw  only a portion of
    the dialog, adjust the clipping rectangle, but not the object number.
    This ensures that the background of the dialog is always  drawn
    correctly.

    The objc_xywh() utility in the download can be used to find the
    clipping rectangle for any object within a dialog, though you may have
    to allow an extra margin is you have used shadows, outlines, or outside
    borders with the object.

    Calling form_do transfers control to the AES, which animates the dialog
    for user interaction.  The address of the dialog tree is passed as a
    parameter.  The second paramter is the number of the editable object at
    which the text cursor will first be positioned. If you have no text
    fields, pass a zero.  Note that again the DRI documents are in error:



                                    Page 3







    passing a -1 default may crash the system. Also be careful that the
    default which you specify is actually a text field; no error checking
    is performed.

    The form_do call returns the number of the object on which the clicked
    to terminate the dialog.  Usually this is a button type object with the
    EXIT and SELECTABLE attributes set.  Setting the DEFAULT attribute as
    well will cause an exit on that object is a carriage return is struck
    while in the dialog.

    If the top bit of the return is set, it indicates that  the exit object
    had the TOUCHEXIT attribute and was selected with a double-click.
    Since very few dialogs use this combination, the sample code simply
    masks off the top bit.

    The next form_dial call reverses the "zoom box", moving it from the
    dialog's location back to the given x,y,w,h.  The same cautions apply
    here as above.

    The final form_dial call tells GEM that the dialog is complete, and
    that the screen area occupied by the dialog is now considered "dirty"
    and needs to be redrawn.  Using the methods described in our last
    column, GEM then sends redraws to all windows which were overlaid, and
    does any necessary redrawing of the menu or desktop itself.

    There is one notable "feature" of form_dial(3):  It always redraws an
    area which is two pixels wider and higher than your request!  This was
    probably included to make sure that drop-shadows were cleaned up, and
    is usually innocuous.


                                 A HANDY TRICK

    Use of the form_dial(3) call is not limited to dialogs.  You can use it
    to force the system to redraw any part of the screen.  The advantage of
    this method is that the redraw area need not lie entirely within a
    window, as was necessary with the send_redraw method detailed in the
    last column.  A disadvantage is that this method is  somewhat slower,
    since the AES has to decide who gets the redraws.


                                   CLEAN UP

    As a last step, you need to clear the SELECTED flag in the object which
    was clicked.  If you do not do this, the object will  be drawn inverted
    the next time you call the dialog.  You could clear the flag with the
    GEM objc_change call, but it is inefficient since you do not need to
    redraw the object.

    Instead, use the desel_obj() code in the  download, which modifies the
    object's OB_STATE field directly.  Assuming  that ret_obj contains the
    exit object returned by hndl_dial, the call:


       desel_obj(tree, ret_obj);



                                    Page 4








    will do the trick.


                                     RECAP

    The basic dialog handling method I have described contains three steps:
    initialization (rsrc_gaddr), dialog presentation (hndl_dial), and
    cleanup (desel_obj).

    As we build more advanced dialogs, these same basic steps will be
    performed, but they will grow more complex. The initialization will
    include setting up proper object text and states, and the cleanup phase
    will also interrogate the final states of objects to find out what the
    user did.


                                BUTTON, BUTTON

    The simple dialogs described above contain only exit buttons as active
    objects.  As such, they are little more than glorified alert boxes.

    We will now increase the complexity a little by considering non-exit
    buttons.  These are constructed by setting the SELECTABLE attribute on
    a button object.  At run-time, such an object will toggle its state
    between selected (highlighted) and non-selected  whenever the user
    clicks on it.  (You can set the SELECTABLE attribute  of other types of
    objects and use them instead of actual buttons, but  be sure that the
    user will be able to figure out what you intend!)

    Having non-exit buttons forces us to consider the problem of
    initializing them before the dialog, and interrogating and resetting
    them afterward.

    Since a button is a toggle, it is usually associated with a flag
    variable in the program.  As part of the initialization, you should
    test the flag variable, and if true call:


       sel_obj(tree, BTNOBJ);

    which will cause the button to appear highlighted when the dialog is
    first drawn.  Sel_obj() is in the download.  BTNOBJ is replaced with
    the  name you gave your button when you defined it in the RCS.  Since
    the button starts out deselected, you don't have to do anything if your
    flag variable is false.

    After the dialog has completed, you need to check the object's state.
    The selectp() utility does so by masking the OB_STATE field.  You can
    simply assign the result of this test to your flag variable, but be
    sure that the dialog was exited with an OK button, not with a CANCEL!
    Again, remember to clean up the button with desel_obj(). (It's often
    easiest to deselect all buttons just before you leave the dialog
    routine, regardless of the final dialog state.)




                                    Page 5








                             WHO'S GOT THE BUTTON?

    Another common use of buttons in a  dialog is to select one of a set of
    possible options.  In GEM, such objects are called radio buttons. This
    term recalls automobile radio tuners where pushing in one button pops
    out any others.  In like fashion, selecting any one of a set of radio
    buttons automatically deselects all of the others.

    To use the radio button feature, you must do some careful work with the
    Resource Construction Set.

    First, each member of a set of  radio buttons must be children of the
    same parent object within the  object tree. To create this structure,
    put a hollow box type object in the  dialog, make it big enough to hold
    all of the buttons, and then put the buttons into the box one at a
    time.

    By nesting the buttons within the  box object, you force them to be its
    children.  Each of the buttons must have both the SELECTABLE and RADIO
    BUTTON attributes set.  When you are done, you may make the containing
    box invisible by setting its border to zero, but do not FLATTEN it!

    Since each radio button represents a different option, you must usually
    assign a name to each object.  When initializing the dialog, you must
    check which option is currently set, and turn on the corresponding
    button only.  A chain of if-then-else structures assures that only one
    button will be selected.

    At the conclusion of the dialog, you must check each button with
    selectp() and make the appropriate adjustments to internal variables.
    Again, an if-then-else chain is appropriate since only one button may
    be selected.  Either deselect the chosen button within this chain or do
    them all at the end.

    There is one common use of radio buttons in which you may short-cut
    this procedure.  If the buttons each represent one possible value of a
    numeric variable, for instance, a set of selector buttons representing
    colors from zero to seven, then you can compute the initial object
    directly.

    In order for this technique to work, you must use a special capability
    of the RCS.  Insert the object corresponding to a zero value at the top
    (or left) of your array of buttons, then put the "one" button below (or
    right) of it, and so on.

    When the buttons are complete,  the SORT operation is used to guarantee
    that the top/left object is in fact the first child of the parent box
    with the others following in order.  Due to the details of object tree
    structure (to be discussed in the next column), this will guarantee
    that these objects are contiguous in the resource.

    If you assign a name (say BUTTON1) to the first button,  then you can
    initialize the correct button with the call:




                                    Page 6








       sel_obj(tree, BUTTON1 + field);

    where field is the variable of interest.

    When the dialog is complete, you can scan the radio buttons to compute
    the new value for the underlying variable.  The encode() procedure in
    the download will do this.  As always, remember to deselect the buttons
    at the end.

    You can use offsets or multipliers if your variable's values don't
    start with zero or increment by one.  If the values are irregular you
    may be able to use a lookup table, at the cost of additional code.


                                COMING UP NEXT

    In the next column, I will discuss the internal structure of object
    trees.  Then we'll use that knowledge to build a piece of code which
    will "walk" an entire tree and apply a function to each object. We'll
    apply this code to do all of the button deselects  with a single call!
    I'll also look at handling editable text fields and discuss some ways
    to alter a dialog's appearance at run-time.

    An editing error caused an omission in the first installment of ST PRO
    GEM.  The window components RTARROW and DNARROW should have been listed
    along with HSLIDE as the horizontal equivalents of the vertical slider
    components which were discussed.
