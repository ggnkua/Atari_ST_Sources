             Column #10 -  VDI Graphics: Text Output

       This  issue of ST PRO GEM concludes the two column series  on
  VDI  with a look at simple VDI  text output,  and ways to optimize
  its  speed.   There is also a Feedback section.   You may find the
  associated  download  file under the name GMCL10.C in DL3  of  the
  ATARI16 SIG (PCS-58).

       To  keep  the size of this first discussion  of  text  within
  reason, I am going to restrict it to use of the mono-spaced system
  font   in  its  default  size  and  orientation.    Discussion  of
  alternate and proportionally spaced fonts,  baseline rotation, and
  character scaling will become a later article in this series.

                           DEFINITIONS.
       This  article  makes use of  some  terminology  which  may  be
  unfamiliar if you have not used digital typefaces.   A mono-spaced
  font  is  one in which  each  character  occupies  an  identically
  wide  space  on  the screen.   A proportional font  has characters
  which occupy different widths. For instance, an 'l' would probably
  be narrower than a 'w'.

      Text may be "justified" right,  left,  or center.  This  means
  that  the right character,  left character,  or center position of
  the  text  string is constrained to a given location.   In  common
  usage,  a  page  of text is "ragged right" if its lines  are  left
  justified only.   The text page is "fully justified",  "justified"
  or  (ambiguously)  "right justified" if BOTH the  left  and  right
  characters are contrained to fixed columns.  Full justification is
  produced  by  inserting extra blank characters in the  case  of  a
  mono-spaced font,  or by adding extra pixel columns in the case of
  proportional output.

       A  text character (in a monospaced font) is written inside  a
  standard sized cell or box.  Vertically, the cell extends from the
  "top  line" down to the "bottom line".   If there are one or  more
  blank  lines at the top or bottom,  they are called "leading"  and
  are  used  to separate lines of text.   The characters  themselves
  always  fall between the "ascent line",  which is the highest line
  reached by characters such as 'd' and 'l', and the "descent line",
  which  is the lowest line in characters like 'q' and  'g'.   Other
  locations  of  interest are the "half line",  which is the top  of
  characters  like  'a' or 'n',  and the "base line",  which is  the
  bottom of characters which do not have descenders.

       Before  plunging into the Attribute Functions for  text,  you
  should  note  that  the  writing  mode  (vswr_mode)  and  clipping
  rectangle  (vs_clip) attributes discussed in the last column  (#9)
  also  pertain  to  text.   Since much of the  discussion  of  text
  optimization  will  center on these attributes,  you may  want  to
  review them.

                          TEXT ATTRIBUTES
       The writing color for graphics text is set with the command:

            vst_color(vdi_handle, color);

  Vdi_handle  is  always the handle returned from  graf_handle()  at
  application startup.  Color is a word value between 0 and 15 which
  designates  the  output  color index.   As discussed  in  previous
  columns,  the  actual  color  which appears is  dependent  on  the
  current  palette  settings.   In  applications such  as  word  and
  outline  processors  it  is important that  characters  and  their
  background  provide  good contrast to avoid eyestrain.   In  these
  situations,  you  may  want to use the setPalette and/or  setColor
  XBIOS  functions  to  force the palette to a  known  state  before
  starting the application.

       You  can choose a variety of special output effects for  your
  text with the call:

            vst_effects(vdi_handle, effects);

  Effects is a single flag word,  with the bits having the following
  significance:

            0 - Thicken
            1 - Lighten
            2 - Skew
            3 - Underline
            4 - Outline
            5 - Shadow

  In each case,  turning the bit on selects the effect.   Otherwise,
  the  effect  is  off.   Any  number of  multiple  effects  may  be
  selected, but the result may not always be pleasing or legible.

       The  "thicken"  effect widens the character  strokes  by  one
  pixel,   resulting  in  the  appearance  of  boldface  type.   The
  "lighten" effect superimposes a half-tone dither on the character.
  This mode is useful for indicating non-selectable text items,  but
  is not legible enough for other purposes.

       The  skew effect shifts the rows of the character the  right,
  with  the greatest displacement at the top.   This results in  the
  appearance of italic text.   You should be aware that the VDI does
  not  compensate for this effect.   This means that a skewed italic
  character which is immediately followed by a normal blank will  be
  overstruck,  and  part of the top of the character will disappear.
  Likewise,  a  skewed character written to the left of an  existing
  normal  character will overstrike part of it.   There is a related
  bug  in  the VDI clipping logic which may cause some  parts  of  a
  skewed  character not to be redrawn if they fall at the edge of  a
  clipping  rectangle,  even  though  they should  fall  within  the
  region.

       The  outline  effect  produces output which is  a  one  pixel
  "halo" around the normal character.  The shadow effect attempts to
  create  a  "drop  shadow" to the side  of  the  character.   These
  effects  should be used very sparingly with default  sized  fonts.
  They often result in illegible output.

       When  graphics text is written,  a screen coordinate must  be
  specified  for  the output.   The relationship of the text to  the
  screen point is determined by the call:

            vst_alignment(vdi_handle, hin, vin, &hout, &vout);

  Hin  and  vin are each words,  with values specifying the  desired
  horizontal  and vertical alignment,  respectively.   Hout and vout
  receive the actual values set by the VDI.  If they differ from the
  requested values, an error has occurred.

       Hin may be set to zero for left justification, one for center
  justification,  or  two  for right justification.   The coordinate
  given when text is written becomes the "anchor point" as described
  in the definitions above.  The default justification is left.

       Vin determines what reference line of the text is  positioned
  at the output coordinate.  The selection values are:

            0 - baseline (default)
            1 - half line
            2 - ascent line
            3 - bottom line
            4 - descent line
            5 - top line

       A  common combination of alignments is left (0) and top  line
  (5).   This  mode guarantees that all text output will lie to  the
  right and below the output coordinate.   This corresponds with the
  AES object and GRECT coordinate systems.

       Finally, the call to do the actual output is:

            v_gtext(vdi_handle, x, y, string);

  X  and y define the screen coordinate to be used as the  alignment
  point.   String  is  a pointer to a null terminated string,  which
  must  be total eighty characters or less,  exclusive of the  null.
  This limit is imposed by the size of the intin[] array in the  VDI
  binding.   Be  warned  that  it  is NOT checked  in  the  standard
  binding!  Exceeding it may cause memory to be overwritten.

       One Inquire Function is useful with text output.  The call

            vqt_attributes(vdi_handle, attrib);

  reads  back the current attribute settings into the 10 word  array
  attrib[].   The  main  items  of interest  are  attrib[6]  through
  attrib[9],  which contain the width and height of characters,  and
  the  width and height of the character cell in the  current  font.
  You  should  rely  on this function to  obtain  size  information,
  rather  than using the output of the graf_handle()  function.   On
  the ST, graf_handle() always returns sizes for the monochrome mode
  system font, which will be incorrect in the color screen modes.

       Attrib[1] will contain the current graphics text color as set
  by  vst_color().   Attrib[3]  and [4] contain the  horizontal  and
  vertical alignment settings, respectively.  Attrib[5] contains the
  current writing mode, as set by vswr_mode().

                          OPTIMIZATION
       The most common  complaint about using bit maps for character
  output is  lack of speed.   This section  suggests  ways to  speed
  things up.   By adopting all of these methods,  you can realize an
  improvement of two to three times in speed.

                          BYTE ALIGNMENT
       Since   writing  graphic   text  is  essentially  a  bit-blit
  operation, characters which have "fringes", that is, do not  align
  evenly with byte boundaries,  will suffer  performance penalities.
  The  default  system  fonts  in  all  resolutions  of the ST are a
  multiple of eight pixels wide, so the problem reduces to  assuring
  that each characters starts at a byte boundary  in  the screen bit
  map. This will be true if the horizontal pixel address of the left
  edge of the character is evenly divisible by eight.

       Obviously,  byte  alignment  is easiest to enforce  when  the
  horizontal justification is right or left.  Doing so with centered
  text is possible, but requires adding padding blanks to odd length
  strings.

       When  writing  text within windows,  it is helpful to  assure
  that the edges of the window working area are byte aligned.  There
  is  a section of code in the download which shows a technique  for
  converting  a  user requested window position and/or size  to  its
  working   dimensions,   byte-aligning  the  width  and  horizontal
  position, and computing the adjusted external window coordinates.

                          WRITING MODE
       The  fastest  text  output mode  is replace.  All other modes
  require reading in  the target raster area and merging it with the
  new information.   You may find that you  must  use transparent or
  reverse  transparent  mode,  for  instance,  to use or preserve an
  underlying  background color other than white.  In this case,  you
  can  still  do  some  optimization by  filling  in  the background
  color for the entire string with a v_bar() call, rather than doing
  it one character cell at a time.

                          CLIPPING
       VDI output always proceeds faster when the clipping rectangle
  is turned off, and text output is no exception. Remember that  you
  may only do this if you are  drawing  into  a dialog box,  or into
  the interior of a window which you know is on top.  (You  can  use
  the WM_TOPPED and WM_NEWTOP  messages for keeping track of the top
  window, or use the  WF_TOP  wind_get()   call  to find the current
  top.)  In both of these cases,  you will know  the  width  of  the
  drawing  area,  and  you  can  truncate  the  output string to fit
  exactly,  rather than setting the clipping rectangle.  For this to
  work,  you must have used the  byte  alignment technique to assure
  that the width of the writing area is  a  multiple  of eight.

                          BINDINGS
       The  normal  binding  for v_gtext() is inefficient. It copies
  the string which you supply  character-by-character  into  intin[]
  before it calls the VDI itself.   In many cases,  it  will be more
  efficient  for your application to place characters  directly into
  intin[] and make the VDI trap call directly.  To give you a start,
  the code  for  the standard v_gtext()  binding  has  been included
  in the download. When setting up intin[], be sure not to load more
  than 80 characters, or you will probably crash the system!

                          MOVING TEXT
       When performing text editing on the screen, you should  avoid
  rewriting the string  under edit whenever  possible.  It is always
  more  efficient to  use the raster  operations to move a string to
  the  right or left,   assuming  that  you  have  obeyed  the  byte
  alignment rule. If you are deleting characters, blit the unchanged
  part of the screen to the left,  and overstrike the last character
  in the  string  with a blank.   If inserting  characters, blit the
  trailing  portion of the string to the right before writing in the
  new character.

                          THAT'S IT FOR NOW
       This  concludes the two article series on simple  VDI output.
  Future  columns  may  explore  more  complex  VDI  topics  such as
  proportional text.  If there is something you would like  to  see,
  please  use the Online Feedback to  let me know!   Meanwhile,  the
  next column will give out the locations of some of the "hooks" and
  "trapdoors" built into the AES object structure,  including how to
  set up user-defined AES drawing  objects.
