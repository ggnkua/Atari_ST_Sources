     Column #12:  GEM Events and Program Structure

     So I fibbed a little.  This issue (#12) of ST PRO GEM started
out to be another discussion of interface issues.  But, as Tolkien
once said, the tale grew in the telling, and this is now the first
of  a series of three articles.   This part will discuss AES event
handling  and  its implications for GEM  program  structure.   The
following  article will contain a "home brew" dialog handler  with
some  new  features,  and  the third will,  finally,  take up  the
discussion  of  interface design,  using the dialog handler as  an
example.   (There is no download for this article.   The downloads
will return, with a vengeance, in ST PRO GEM #13.)

     ALL FOR ONE,  AND ONE FOR ALL.  A quick inspection of the AES
documents  shows that there are five routines devoted  to  waiting
for individual types of events, and one routine, evnt_multi, which
is  used  when more than one type is desired.   This article  will
discuss  ONLY evnt_multi for two reasons.   First,  it is the most
frequently used of the routines.   Second, waiting for one type of
event is a bad practice.   Any event call turns the system over to
the AES and suspends the application and its interaction with  the
user.   In  such  cases,  some  "escape clause",  such as a timer,
should be inserted to revive the program and prompt the user if no
event  is  forthcoming.   Otherwise,  the  application may end  up
apparently  (or  actually)  hung,  with a  resulting  reboot,  and
probably a very annoyed user.

     STARTING  AHEAD.   One  possible type of event is a  message.
Messages  are usually sent to the application by the AES,  and are
associated  with  windows or the menu.   Two previous articles  in
this  series have discussed such messages.   ST PRO GEM number two
considered   window  messages,   and  number  seven  handled  menu
messages.  You may want to review these topics before proceeding.

     The actual evnt_multi call is a horrendous thing:

     ev_which = evnt_multi(ev_flags,
               btn_clicks, btn_mask, btn_state,
               r1_flags, r1_x, r1_y, r1_w, r1_h,
               r2_flags, r2_x, r2_y, r2_w, r2_h,
               &msg_buff,
               time_lo, time_hi,
               &mx, &my, &btn, &kbd, &char, &clicks);

Each  of  the lines in the call relate to a different  event,  and
they  will be discussed in the order in which they  appear.

     Note  that a call with this number of parameters causes  some
overhead  due  to stacking and retrieval of the values.   In  most
cases,  this  should be of little concern on a machine as fast  as
the ST.   However, where throughput is a concern, such as in close
tracking  of the mouse cursor,  you may want to write a customized
binding  for evnt_multi which dispenses with the  parameter  list.
This  can  be accomplished by maintaining the values in  a  static
array  and moving them as a block into the binding  arrays  int_in
(for all values but &msg_buff), and addr_in (for &msg_buff).  Note
that  you  may NOT simply leave the values in  int_in;  other  AES
bindings reuse this space.

     Ev_flags  and ev_which are both 16-bit integers  composed  of
flag bits.  Bits set in ev_flags determine which event(s) the call
will  wait  for;  those  set in ev_which  indicate  what  event(s)
actually occurred.   Both use the following flag bit mnemonics and
functions:

     0x0001 - MU_KEYBD - Keyboard input
     0x0002 - MU_BUTTON - Mouse button(s)
     0x0004 - MU_M1 - Mouse rectangle #1
     0x0008 - MU_M2 - Mouse rectangle #2
     0x0010 - MU_MESAG - AES message
     0x0020 - MU_TIMER - Timer

The  appropriate mnemonics are ORed together to create the  proper
ev_flags value.

     There  is  one  common pitfall here.   Notice  that  multiple
events  may  be reported from one evnt_multi.   Event  merging  is
performed  by the AES in order to save space on the  application's
event queue.   If events have been merged,  more than one bit will
be  set in the ev_which word.   Your application must check ALL of
the  bits  before  returning to a new  evnt_multi  call.   If  you
don't do this, some events may be effectively lost.

     The  first event to be considered is the mouse button.   This
is probably the most difficult event to understand and use, and it
has one major shortcoming.

     The  parameter  btn_clicks tells GEM the  maximum  number  of
clicks which you are interested in seeing.   This value is usually
two,  if your program uses the double-click method, or one if only
single  clicks  are used.   The AES returns the number  of  clicks
which caused the event through &clicks, which must be a pointer to
a word.

     GEM determines the number of clicks by the following  method.
When the first button-down is detected, a time delay is begun.  If
another  complete button-up,  button-down cycle is detected before
the time expires,  then the result is a double click.   Otherwise,
the  event is a single click.    Note that the final state of  the
buttons  is  returned via &btn,  as described below.   By checking
this  final state,  you may determine whether a single click event
ended with the button up (a full click),  or with the button still
down  (which  may  be  interpreted as  the  beginning  of  a  drag
operation).   Double clicking is meaningless,  and not checked, if
the evnt_multi is waiting on more than one button (see below).

     The double-click detection delay is variable,  and may be set
by your program using the call

     ev_dspeed = ev_dclick(ev_dnew, ev_dfunc);

Ev_dfunc  is a flag which determines the purpose of the call.   If
it  is  zero,  the  current  double click  speed  is  returned  in
ev_dspeed.   If ev_dfunc is non-zero, then ev_dnew becomes the new
double-click   speed.    Both  ev_dspeed  and  ev_dnew  are  words
containing  a "magic number" between zero and four.   Zero is  the
slowest  (i.e.,  longest)  double-click,  and four is the fastest.
(These  correspond  to  the  slow-fast  range  in  the   Desktop's
Preferences  dialog.)  In general,  you should not reset the click
speed  unless  specifically requested,  because such a change  can
throw off the user's timing and destroy the hand/eye  coordination
involved in using the mouse.

     GEM  was  originally designed to work with  a  single  button
input device.   This allows GEM applications to function well with
devices such as light pens and digitizing tablets.   However, some
features are available for dealing with multi-button mice like the
ST's.

     The  evnt_multi parameters btn_mask and btn_state  are  words
containing  flag bits corresponding to buttons.   The lowest order
bit corresponds to the left-most button,  and so on.  A bit is set
in  the  btn_mask parameter if the AES is to  watch  a  particular
button. The  corresponding bit in btn_state  is set to the  values
for  which  the program is waiting.   The word returned  via  &btn
uses  the  same  bit system to show the state of  the  buttons  at
completion.   It  is  important to notice that all of  the  target
states in btn_state must occur SIMULTANEOUSLY for the event to  be
triggered.

     Note the limiting nature of this last statement.  It prevents
a  program from waiting for EITHER the left or right button to  be
pressed.  Instead, it must wait for BOTH to be pressed, which is a
difficult  operation  at best.   As a result,  the standard  mouse
button  procedure is practically useless if you want to take  full
advantage  of  both buttons on the ST mouse.   In this case,  your
program  must "poll" the mouse state and  determine  double-clicks
itself.   (More  on  polling later.)  By the way,  many  designers
(myself  included) believe that using both buttons  is  inherently
confusing and should be avoided anyway.

     MOUSE RECTANGLES.  One of GEM's nicer features is its ability
to watch the mouse pointer's position for you, and report an event
only  when it enters or departs a given screen region.   Since you
don't  have to track the mouse pixel by pixel,  this eliminates  a
lot  of application overhead.   The evnt_multi call gives you  the
ability  to  specify one or two rectangular areas  which  will  be
watched.   An event can be generated either when the mouse pointer
enters the rectangle,  or when it leaves the rectangle.  The "r1_"
series  of  parameters specifies one of the  rectangles,  and  the
"r2_" series spe{cifies the other, as follows:

     r1_flag, r2_flag - zero if waiting to enter rectangle,
                         one if waiting to leave rectangle
     r1_x, r2_x - upper left X raster coordinate of wait rectangle
     r1_y, r2_y - upper left Y raster coordinate of wait rectangle
     r1_w, r2_w - width of wait rectangle in pixels
     r1_h, r2_h - height of wait rectangle in pixels

Each  rectangle  wait will only be active if its  associated  flag
(MU_M1 or MU_M2) was set in ev_flags.
used when creating mouse-sensitive regions on the screen.   Mouse-
sensitive regions, also called "hot spots", are objects which show
a  visual effect,  such as inversion or outlining,  when the mouse
cursor  moves  over them.   The items in a menu dropdown,  or  the
inversion  of  Desktop icons during a drag operation,  are  common
examples.

        Hot spots are commonly created by grouping  the  sensitive
objects  into  one  or  two areas,  and then setting  up  a  mouse
rectangle  wait  for  entering  the  area.    When  the  event  is
generated,  the  &mx  and &my returns may be examined to find  the
true  mouse coordinates,  and objc_find or some other search  will
determine  the affected object.   The object is then  highlighted,
and  a new wait for exiting the object rectangle is  posted.   (ST
PRO  GEM  #13 will show how to create more  complex  effects  with
rectangle waits.)

     The  second common use of rectangle waits is in  animating  a
drag operation.  In many cases, you can use standard AES animation
routines such as graf_dragbox or graf_rubberbox.   In other cases,
you  may  want  a figure other than a simple  box,  or  desire  to
combine   waits  for  other  conditions  such  as  keystrokes   or
collision with hotspots.  Then you will need to implement the drag
operation  yourself,  using  the  mouse rectangles  to  track  the
cursor.

     If you want to track the cursor closely, simply wait for exit
on a one pixel rectangle at the current position,  and perform the
animation routine at each event.  If the drag operation only works
on a grid,  such as character positions,  you can specify a larger
wait  rectangle and only update the display when a legal  boundary
is crossed.

     MESSAGES.   The  &msg_buff parameter of evnt_multi gives  the
address  of a 16 byte buffer to receive an AES message.   As noted
above,  I have discussed standard AES messages elsewhere. The last
column  also mentioned that messages may be used to  simulate  co-
routines  within  a single GEM program.

     A  further possibility which bears examination is the use  of
messages  to coordinate the activities of multiple  programs.   In
single-tasking  GEM,  at least one of these programs would have to
be  a  desk accessory.   In any such use of the GEM messages,  you
should pay careful attention to the possibility of overloading the
queue.   Only  eight  slots are provided per task,  and  messages,
unlike events, cannot be merged by the AES.

     TIMER.   The  timer event gives you a way of pacing action on
the  screen,  clocking out messages,  or providing a time-out exit
for   an  operation.    Evnt_multi  has  two  16-bit  timer  input
parameters,  time_hi  and  time_lo,  which are the top and  bottom
halves,  respectively,  of  a  32-bit millisecond count.   However,
this documented time resolution must be taken with a grain of salt
on the ST, considering that its internal clock frequency is 200Hz!

     The  timer  event is also extremely useful  for  polling  the
event  queue.   A  "poll"  tests the queue  for  completed  events
without going into a wait state if none are present.  In GEM, this
is   done  by  generating  a  null  event  which   always   occurs
immediately.  A timer count of zero will do just that.

     Therefore,  you  can poll for any set of events by specifying
them  in  the evnt_multi parameters.   A zero timer wait  is  then
added to ensure immediate completion.   Upon return,  if any event
bit(s) OTHER than MU_TIMER are set,  a significant event was found
on the queue.  If only MU_TIMER is set, the poll failed to find an
event.

     KEYBOARD.   There  are  no input parameters for the  keyboard
event.   The  character  which  is read is returned  as  a  16-bit
quantity through the &char parameter.  For historical reasons, the
codes  which  are returned are compatible with the IBM  PC's  BIOS
level scan codes.  You can find this character table in Appendix D
of  the  GEM VDI manual.   In general,  the high byte need only be
considered  if  the lower byte is zero.   If the low byte is  non-
zero, it is a valid ASCII character.

     Evnt_multi  also returns the status of several modifier  keys
through  the &kbd parameter.   This word contains four significant
bits as follows:

     0x0001 - Right hand shift key
     0x0002 - Left hand shift key
     0x0004 - Control key
     0x0008 - ALT key

If  a  bit  is  one,  the key was depressed  when  the  event  was
generated.   Otherwise,  the key was up.  Since the state of these
keys  is already taken into account in generating the  &char  scan
code,  the  &kbd word is most useful when creating enhanced  mouse
functions, such as shift-click or control-drag.

     RANDOM NOTES ON EVENTS.   Although the &mx,  &my,  &btn,  and
&kbd returns are nominally associated with particular event types,
they are valid on any return from evnt_multi, and reflect the last
event  which was merged into that return by the AES.  If you  want
more  current values,  you may use graf_mkstate to resample  them.
Whichever method you choose, be consistent within the application,
since  the point of sampling has an effect on mouse  and  keyboard
timing.

     Although  this and preceding columns have been  presented  in
terms of a GEM application,  the event system has many interesting
implications  for desk accessories.   Since the AES scheduler uses
non-preemptive  dispatching,  accessories  have an event  priority
effectively  equal  to  the main  application.   Though  "typical"
accessories  wait  only for AC_OPEN or AC_CLOSE messages  when  in
their  quiescent state,  this is not a requirement of the  system.
Timer  and  other events may also be requested  by  an  accessory.
(Indeed,  there  is  no  absolute requirement  that  an  accessory
advertise  its presence with a menu_register call.)  The  aspiring
GEM hacker might consider how these facts could be used to  create
accessories  similar  to  "BUGS" on the Mac,  or  to  the  "Crabs"
program  described  in  the September,  1985 issue  of  Scientific
American.

     EVENTS  AND GEM PROGRAM STRUCTURE.   Although the  evnt_multi
call  might seem to be a small part of the entire GEM system,  its
usage has deep implications for the structure of any  application.
It is generally true that each use of evnt_multi corresponds to  a
mode  in  the  program.   For instance,  form_do contains its  own
evnt_multi,  and its invocation creates a moded dialog.  While the
dialog  is in progress,  other features such as windows and  menus
are unusable.  The graf_dragbox, graf_rubberbox, and graf_slidebox
routines also contain evnt_multi calls.   They create a mode which
is sometimes called "spring-loaded",  since the mode vanishes when
some continuing condition (a depressed mouse button) is removed.

     In consequence,  a well-designed,  non-modal GEM program will
contain only one explicit evnt_multi call.  This call is part of a
top-level  loop  which  decodes events as they  are  received  and
dispatches  control  to  the appropriate  handling  routine.   The
dispatcher  must  always  distinguish  between  event  types.   In
programs  where  multiple windows are used,  it may also  need  to
determine which local data structure is associated with the active
window.

     This  construction  is  sometimes  called  a  "push"  program
structure,  because  it  allows the user to drive the  application
by generating events in any order.  This contrasts with the "pull"
structure of traditional command line or menu programs,  where the
application is in control and demands input at each step before it
proceeds.    "Push"  structure  promotes  consistent  use  of  the
user interface and a feeling of control on the part of the user.

     The  next ST PRO GEM column will look more closely at  events
and  program  structure in the context of a large piece  of  code.
The  code  implements an alternate dialog  handler,  incorporating
mouse-sensitive objects as part of the standard interface.   Since
this  code  is  "open",  it may be modified and  merged  with  any
application's main event loop, resulting in non-modal dialogs.
