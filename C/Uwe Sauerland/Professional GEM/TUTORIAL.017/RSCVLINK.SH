    Keywords: KOUNT.TTP C TOOL WC WORD COUNT
    
    This is a highly modified version of the WC program from "Software Tools"
    by Brian Kerninghan and P J Plauger, Addison Wesley, 1976. It has no
    runtime options byt handles multiple files and gives totals at the end. It
    also will give character counts with and without newlines counted. Let me
    know if you have any suggestions (will UL the source on request). Enjoy...
