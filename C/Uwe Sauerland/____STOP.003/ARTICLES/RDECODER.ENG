     Which hardware-freak doesn't know the problem:

     You'd like to build a circuit printed in a magazine and need 
     some resistances.  Somewhere you'll find some lying  around, 
     but what values do they have ?

     This program helps you.  Simply click in a dialogue-box  and 
     you'l be prompted with the resistance-values
