{
 light.dat - check if merging of three light sources coloured red, green
 and blue does really result in a white light.

 This file is already prepared for use with Rayscene - if you want to test
 without Rayscene, you will have to replace the three values
 #bluex#, #redx#, #greenz# with reasonable values first.
