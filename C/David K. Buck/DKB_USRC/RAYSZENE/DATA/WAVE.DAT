{
 a .dat file to experiment with - just a wavy ground plane and one light
 source - might look a bit like a moon standing over the sea
 One can easily create an animation from this by just taking the PHASE
 value inside the wave's definition from 0 to 1. But don't forget:
 if you create, say, 10 frames with PHASE values from 0.0 to 0.9,
 the waves will run together - if you want waves that move outwards,
 choose values from 0.9 ... 0.0
 This is no real .dat file - just to get the ball going..I hope :-)
