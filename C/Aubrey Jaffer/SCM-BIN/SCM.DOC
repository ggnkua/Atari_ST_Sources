NAME
     scm - a Scheme Language Interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     scm [arg ...]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_c_m is an interactive Scheme interpreter.

     If ScmInit.scm exists in (getenv "HOME") directory then it
     is loaded; otherwise, each arg is given to LOAD in the order
     specified.  _S_c_m then evaluates and prints all expressions
     typed into it.

     Here are some of _s_c_m'_s features:

     Runs under Amiga, Atari-ST, MacOS, MS-DOS, NOS/VE, VMS, Unix
     and similar systems.

     Conforms to Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language
     Scheme and the IEEE P1178 specification.

     Enchancements to support files open for simultaneous reading
     and writing.

     Setable levels of monitoring and timing information printed
     interactively (the `verbose' function).

     User definable responses to interrupts and errors.

     open-pipe, close-pipe, open-file, close-file, file-exists?,
     force-output, chdir, alarm, system, quit, program-arguments,
     getenv, tmpnam, software-type, ed, abort, line-number, get-
     decoded-time, get-internal-run-time, get-internal-real-time,
     substring-move-left!, substring-move-right!, substring-
     fill!, object-hash, object-unhash, delete-file, rename-file,
     and try-load functions.

     *Features* and *load-pathname* variables.

     char-code-limit, most-positive-fixnum, most-negative-fixnum,
     and internal-time-units-per-second constants.

     Support for ASCII and EBCDIC character sets.

     Documentation on the internal representation and how to
     extend or include scm in other programs (code.doc in the
     source directory).
