	* scl.c (eqp lessp greaterp lesseqp greatereqp):
	Comparisons with inexact numbers was not being performed
	correctly.  For example, (< 1.0 2.0 1.5) would yield #t.  What was
	missing was a line x=y; in the inexact comparison sections of
	lessp(), greaterp(), lesseqp() and greatereqp().  In addition, I

	* sys.c (gc_sweep): usaage of pclose() now conditional on unix.

	* MANUAL (chdir): documented.

   from T. Kurt Bond, Adminisoft, Inc. <tkb@MTNET2.WVNET.EDU>:

	* repl.c sys.c (errno): VMS GNU C uses a special hack in <errno.h>
	to get the link-time attributes for the errno variable to match
	those the VMS C run-time library expects (it makes errno a
	preprocessor define so that the variable that the compiler sees
	has a special form that the assember then interprets), so if it is
	VMS and __GNUC__ is defined <errno.h> needs included.

	* setjump.h (SETJUMP LONGJUMP): SETJUMP and LONGJUMP changed to
	setjump and longjump. The VMS linker is case-indifferent.  VMS GNU
	C mangles variable names that have upper case letters in them to
	preserve their uniqueness.

	* sys.c (iprint iprin1): Now inline putc loops instead of calls to
	fwrite for VMS. The VMS `fwrite' has been enhanced to work with
	VMS's Record Management Sevice, RMS.  Part of this enhancement is
	to treat each call to `fwrite' as producing a seperate record.
	This works fine if you are writing to a stream_LF file or an
	actual terminal screen, but if you are writing to a file that has
	implied carriage control (such as a batch log file, or a mailbox
	used for subprocess communication), which is a more common file
	organization for RMS, each call to `fwrite' has a newline appended
	to it.  This causes much of the output to be incorrectly split
	across lines.

	* vmsgcc.com: created.

Sun Dec  1 00:33:42 1991  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at Ivan)

	definitions in order to fix characters having negative codes.

	* scm.h (MAKISYM, MAKFLAG, ICHR, MAKICHR, MAKINUM): Now cast to
	long so that their calls don't have to.  Changing MAKICHR fixed
	problem in scl.c (string2list) on IBMPC.

	* subr.c (quotient): support for `/' reintroduced; required by
	r3.99rs but not IEEE.

	* subr.c (char functions): added isascii tests for

	* test.scm: added tests for char-alphabetic, char-numeric?,
	char-whitespace?, char-upper-case?, and char-lower-case?.

	Substituted breaks and reordered switch and if clauses.

Sun Feb  3 23:12:34 1991  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at foxkid)

	* scm1-2: released. 

	* sys.c (read-char peek-char) added code for EOF.

	* test.scm (leaf-eq?) added and file "cont.scm" removed.  I/O
	tests added.

	* sys.c (I/O functions) now check for input and output ports
	rather than just ports.

	* sys.c (lprin1f): occurences of stdout changed to f.  Newlines
	after printing port removed.

Thu Jan 31 22:52:39 1991  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at foxkid)

	* eval.c (apply): added checks for number of arguments.

	* scm.h (CHECK_SIGINT): checks for blocked SIGINT.

	* sys.c (lprin1): added blocking and testing for SIGINT so that
	output won't hang on VMS.

	* scm.c (err_head, wta): added fflush calls to error routines so
	that error message come out in proper order.
