This is an ST port of the scheme.  I did it on behalf of <Insert user
name here>.  It involved nothing more than typing `make' and then
wondering what memv does.  I have discovered an error during the load of
init.scm: It says memv: 2nd argument: wrong type or something like that.
Otherwise the thing ran fine, out of the box.  Thanks.
