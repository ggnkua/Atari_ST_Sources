		      INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

If scm is already built (compiled) skip to secton INSTALL.

These #defines should be checked before compilation.  The first 2 can
be defined either in the Makefile or config.h.  See config.h for more
information.

Makefile    config.h	note
------      ----	--------
-DIMPLINIT  IMPLINIT	directory and pathname where Init.scm will
			reside.
-DFLOATS    FLOATS	support for inexact numerical types.  On unix
			systems, FLOATS is automatically handled by
			makefile.unix.

DEST	    		directory where `make install' will put the
			executable.  Unix only.
MANDEST	    		directory where `make install' will put the
			unix style manual page.  Unix only.

These #defines are automatically generated by various preprocessors.
Scm uses them to find include files and the proper names for system
functions.  If a define for your system type is missing on your
system, put -Dflag in the Makefile or #define flag in config.h.

  sys.c, eval.c, scl.c, and sc2.c to it.
  Add libraries MacTraps, unix, ANSI to the project.

  Edit makefile.aztec to set desired options and IMPLINIT.
    make

under SAS/C 5.10 on AMIGA:
  Edit compile.amiga to set desired options and IMPLINIT.
    compile.amiga

			       INSTALL

under UNIX:

  Edit Makefile to have appropriate destinations for scm and scm.1.

      make install

  If IMPLINIT is not correctly defined in Makefile or config.h then
  you will need to define the environment variable SCM_INIT_PATH to be
  the full pathname of Init.scm.  In a csh init file (.cshrc) this is
  done by:
      setenv SCM_INIT_PATH /usr/src/scm/Init.scm
  In a .profile file this should be:
      SCM_INIT_PATH=/usr/src/scm/Init.scm; export SCM_INIT_PATH

  Define the environment variable SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH to be the full
  pathname of the Scheme Library directory if you have one.  In a csh
  init file (.cshrc) this is done by
      setenv SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib/scheme/
  In a .profile file this should be:
      SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/scheme/; export SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH

under VMS:

  Put SCM.EXE, INIT.SCM, and COPYING someplace.  INIT.SCM and COPYING
  need to be in the same directory.  Either put SCM.EXE in a
  SYS$SYSTEM directory or, in your LOGIN.COM file, define the symbol
  SCHEME to be "$" appended to the full pathname of SCM.EXE.  For
  example:
      SCHEME == "$DKB100:[AGJ.SCM]SCM.EXE"

  In your LOGIN.COM file define the environment SCM_INIT_PATH to be
  the full pathname of INIT.SCM.  For example:
      DEFINE SCM_INIT_PATH DKB100:[AGJ.SCM]INIT.SCM
  Define SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH to be the pathname of the Scheme Library
  if you have one.  For example:
      DEFINE SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH DKB100:[AGJ.SLIB]

under MSDOS:

  If you are using DJGPP do:
      STRIP SCM.32
      COPY /B C:\DJGPP\BIN\STUB.EXE+SCM.32 SCM.EXE

  Put SCM.EXE, INIT.SCM, and COPYING someplace.  INIT.SCM and COPYING
  need to be in the same directory.  SCM.EXE needs to be in your
  search path.

  In AUTOEXEC.BAT define the environment variable SCM_INIT_PATH to be
  the full pathname of INIT.SCM.  For example:
      SET SCM_INIT_PATH=G:\AGJ\SCM\INIT.SCM

  In AUTOEXEC.BAT define the environment variable SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH
  to be the full pathname of the Scheme Library directory if you have
  one.  For example:
      SET SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=G:\AGJ\SLIB\

			 EDITING SCHEME CODE

under Gnu Emacs:
  Editing of Scheme code is supported by emacs.  Buffers holding files
  ending in .scm are automatically put into scheme-mode.  However, the
  run-scheme (`xscheme.el') which comes included with Gnu Emacs will
  work only with MIT Cscheme.

  If your Emacs can run a process in a buffer you can use the
  run-scheme command with SCM when you get the emacs packages
  `cmuscheme.el' and `comint.el'.  Otherwise, see "under other
  systems" below.

under Epsilon (MSDOS):
  There is lisp (and scheme) mode available by use of the package
  `LISP.E'.  It offers several different indentation formats.  With
  this package, buffers holding files ending in .L, .LSP, .S, and .SCM
  (my modification) are automatically put into lisp-mode.

  It is possible to run a process in a buffer under Epsilon.  However,
  memory available to the process is limited and episodes of file
  system damage when doing this have occured.  See "under other
  systems" below.

under other systems:
  Define the environment variable "EDITOR" to be the name of the
  editor you use.  The SCM procedure (ed arg1 ...) will then invoke
  that editor and return to SCM when you exit the editor.  I find the
  following definition very convenient:

  (define (e) (ed "work.scm") (load "work.scm"))

  Invoking (e) will then put me into the editor with the file I am
  working on and load this file after I have changed it.
