	From: rshouman@chpc.utexas.edu (Radey Shouman)
	* unif.c: no longer uses pointer comparisons in loops.  Should
	fix problems on 8086 processors.
	* unif.c (make_sh_array): Fixes MAKE-SHARED-ARRAY so that shared
	arrays with only 1 element in some direction may still be
	ARRAY-CONTIGUOUS?
	(uve_write uve_read): Fixes bug in UNIFORM-ARRAY-WRITE,
	UNIFORM-ARRAY_READ!.  Now they do the right thing for shared
	bit-arrays not starting at the beginning of their contents vector.
	(array_contents ARRAY-SIMPLE?): ARRAY-CONTENTS may now return a
	shared, contiguous, 1-d array, instead of a vector, if the array
	cannot access all of the contents vector.  ARRAY-SIMPLE? removed.
	(array-fill!): a replacement and generalization of
	UNIFORM-VECTOR-FILL!.
	(raequal): Combines with uve_equal(), providing also ARRAY-EQUAL?
	ARRAY-EQUAL? is equivalent to EQUAL? if all its arguments are
	uniform vectors or if all are arrays.  It differs from EQUAL? in
	that a shared, 1-d array may be ARRAY-EQUAL? to a uniform vector.
	  for example
	  (define sh (make-shared-array '#(0 1 2 3) list '(0 1))) ==> #1(0 1)
	  (equal? '#(0 1) sh)       ==> #F
	  (array-equal? '#(0 1) sh) ==> #T
	(list2ura): Combines list2uve() and list2ura().

	* makefile.acorn repl.c (set_erase): Port to acorn archimedes.

	From: fred@sce.carleton.ca (Fred J Kaudel)
	* unif.c (ra_matchp ramapc): patch to unif.c avoids two problems
	(K&R C does not allow initialization of "automatic" arrays or
	structures).  This was not use in 4d2 or previously, and the
	following patch ensures that such initialization only occurs for
	ANSI C compilers (Note that K&R C compilers need to explicitly
	assign the values).

	* sys.c (gc_sweep): usaage of pclose() now conditional on unix.

	* MANUAL (chdir): documented.

   from T. Kurt Bond, Adminisoft, Inc. <tkb@MTNET2.WVNET.EDU>:

	* repl.c sys.c (errno): VMS GNU C uses a special hack in <errno.h>
	to get the link-time attributes for the errno variable to match
	those the VMS C run-time library expects (it makes errno a
	preprocessor define so that the variable that the compiler sees
	has a special form that the assember then interprets), so if it is
	VMS and __GNUC__ is defined <errno.h> needs included.

	* setjump.h (SETJUMP LONGJUMP): SETJUMP and LONGJUMP changed to
	setjump and longjump. The VMS linker is case-indifferent.  VMS GNU
	C mangles variable names that have upper case letters in them to
	preserve their uniqueness.

	* sys.c (iprint iprin1): Now inline putc loops instead of calls to
	fwrite for VMS. The VMS `fwrite' has been enhanced to work with
	VMS's Record Management Sevice, RMS.  Part of this enhancement is
	to treat each call to `fwrite' as producing a seperate record.
	This works fine if you are writing to a stream_LF file or an
	actual terminal screen, but if you are writing to a file that has
	implied carriage control (such as a batch log file, or a mailbox
	used for subprocess communication), which is a more common file
	organization for RMS, each call to `fwrite' has a newline appended
	to it.  This causes much of the output to be incorrectly split
	across lines.

	* vmsgcc.com: created.

	* sys.c: #include <malloc.h> not done for VMS

Wed Feb 13 17:49:33 1991  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at foxkid)

	* scm.c scl.c: added unsigned declarations to some char *
	definitions in order to fix characters having negative codes.

	* scm.h (MAKISYM, MAKFLAG, ICHR, MAKICHR, MAKINUM): Now cast to
	long so that their calls don't have to.  Changing MAKICHR fixed
	problem in scl.c (string2list) on IBMPC.

	* subr.c (quotient): support for `/' reintroduced; required by
	r3.99rs but not IEEE.

	* subr.c (char functions): added isascii tests for
	char-alphabetic, char-numeric?, char-whitespace?,
	char-upper-case?, and char-lower-case?.  Added test against
	char_code_limit to int2char.

	* subr.c (s_char_alphap): is subr_1 not lsubr.

	* test.scm: added tests for char-alphabetic, char-numeric?,
	char-whitespace?, char-upper-case?, and char-lower-case?.

	* sys.c: most `return;'s eliminated to reduce warning messages.
	Substituted breaks and reordered switch and if clauses.

	* scm1-2: released. 

	* sys.c (read-char peek-char) added code for EOF.

	* test.scm (leaf-eq?) added and file "cont.scm" removed.  I/O
	tests added.

	* sys.c (I/O functions) now check for input and output ports
	rather than just ports.

	* sys.c (lprin1f): occurences of stdout changed to f.  Newlines
	after printing port removed.

	* subr.c (quotient): support for `/' removed; not required.

	* scm.c (wta): message for OUTOFRANGE fixed.

Mon Jan 28 12:45:55 1991  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at foxkid)

	* eval.c (apply): added checks for number of arguments.

	* scm.h (CHECK_SIGINT): checks for blocked SIGINT.

	* sys.c (lprin1): added blocking and testing for SIGINT so that
	output won't hang on VMS.

	* scm.c (repl): added fflush call.

	* scm.c (err_head, wta): added fflush calls to error routines so
	that error message come out in proper order.
