This file contains instructions for compiling and using MiNT-Net.
For more general information about MiNT-Net, see the file README
in this directory.

This package contains already compiled versions of the libraries
and the socket device driver for people who are not willing or
able to compile the stuff. If you are one of them you can ignore
the following instructions about compiling.

Things needed for compiling:
----------------------------

o	tar and gzip to unpack the archive (bit silly this one since you
	are reading this file).

o	gcc, preferably 2.3x, since later versions have been reported
	to be buggy, at least when using -mbaserel.

o	gmake, preferably 3.6x or later.

o	binutils PL >= 30.

o	MiNTLibs PL >= 41, because as of PL 41 they support the
	socket library in errno.h and strerror(). If you don't mind
	getting messages like 'unknown error' from perror(), you can
	use earlier versions too.

o	Minixfs or something similar that supports long filenames. This
	is not absolutely neccessary, but there are some filenames that
	do not fit into the 8+3 filename scheme.

Rebuilding the library and device driver:
-----------------------------------------

It is easiest to rebuild the whole package by typing
(1)	make clean
(2)	make depend
(3)	make
into the top level directory. This will rebuild the socket device
driver and all the libraries as necessary. (1) deletes all .o files
from previous compilations. (2) generates the dependency-files that
tell make which files need to be rebuilt when changing one particular
file.

Of cource you can 'cd' to one particular subdirectory and remake only
parts of the package. Please have a look at the Makefiles.

You should get the following binaries out of the above steps:
lib/socket.olb		-- 32 bit socket library.
lib/socket16.olb	-- 16 bit socket library.
lib/bsocket.olb		-- 32 bit -mbaserel socket library.
lib/bsocket16.olb	-- 16 bit -mbaserel socket library.
net/sockdev.xdd		-- socket device driver.
tool/netstat		-- netstat(8) utility.

Installing the libraries and the device driver:
-----------------------------------------------

Copy the include files from lib/sys/*.h to your local include directory,
for example /usr/include/sys/. DO NOT COPY THE FILES FROM include/,
they belong to the device driver.

Copy the libraries from lib/*.olb to your local library directory,
for example /usr/lib/.

Copy the execuables from tool/* to one of your bin directories, for
example /bin/.

Copy the device driver net/sockdev.xdd to your /mint/ or /multitos/
directory. As of 1.08 MiNT will automatically load the device driver
when booting. You need NOT change your mint.cnf or whatever, just reboot.

Writing programs that use sockets:
----------------------------------

In order to use the new socket calls, you must at least
#include <sys/socket.h>
and you should link your programs with the appropriate libraries,
for example
gcc sockettest.c -o sockettest.ttp -lsocket

Getting information about socket and network programming:
---------------------------------------------------------

You can obtain information about using the facilities provided by
this package by having a look at the manual pages in the man sub-
directory. You could also get the texinfo manual from the GNU-C
library or a good book, like `Networking with TCP/IP'.



Please report any bugs, problems, incompatibilities, suggestions, thanks, ...

Thank you.


You must not redistribute this version, since it is an alpha test version,
and there are probably bugs left. See README for a disclaimer.


Anyway, have fun with it -- Kay Roemer.
