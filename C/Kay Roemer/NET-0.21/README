This is a early alpha test release of MintNet, a networking extension
for and based upon the MiNT operating system extension for Atari
computers.

BSD sockets are used as the interface to the user level. Currently
only the unix (or file) communication domain is (partially) imple-
mented.
In the future there will be full support for the Internet
communication domain, but that may take a while ...

The package consists of two parts, a loadable device driver and a
library which lets you use the facilities provided by the device
driver via the usual socket(), connect(), ... calls.

There are manual pages for all the socket related library functions,
look at the subdirectory `man'.
 
All the stuff should be regarded as experimental, so

THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


See the file INSTALL for instructions about compiling, installing and
using the package.

Some things to watch out for:
-----------------------------

o	Currently sendmsg() and recvmsg() do not support sending
	and receiving of access rights. (ie file handles in the
	unix domain).

o	There are lots of new error codes, like ENOTCONN, ...
	To get meaningful messages from perror() and strerror() and
	for support of the new errorcode you will need the MiNTLibs
	patchlevel >= 41.

o	For AF_UNIX stream sockets you can set the send buffer size
	with the setsockopt() call only if the socket is connected.
	For AF_UNIX dgram sockets you can't at all set the send buffer
	size, only receive buffer size.

o	stat(), fstat() on sockets and AF_UNIX socket files return for
	the file type S_IFCHR and S_IFREG, respectively (not S_IFSOCK).

o	select()ing for writing on dgram sockets will always report
	that writing will not block, even if the desriptor is NOT
	ready for writing.

o	The FIONREAD ioctl() call on AF_UNIX dgram sockets returns the
	size of the next datagram or zero if none is available. The
	FIONWRITE ioctl() call on AF_UNIX dgram sockets returns always
	0 bytes if you did not specify a destination address for the
	socket using connect().

Any other things than the above mentioned that differ in their behavior
from BSD sockets are probably bugs (or maybe I forgot one :-).

Testing the socket library:
---------------------------

Please test the provided lib/dev driver in any way you can (ie port
unix software that uses sockets, compare it with other socket
implementations you know, try things which might crash, ...) and
report any bugs, improvements, suggestions, thanks, etc. etc. to

roemer@hera.rbi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de (preferred)

The earlier I get feedback, the sooner I can fix your problems,
make new releases, ...

You must not distribute this package, because it is probably still
buggy.

Have fun with it -- Kay Roemer.
