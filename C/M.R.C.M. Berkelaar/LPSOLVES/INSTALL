This package should install easily on any computer with ANSI C support and
POSIX compatible include files. You need lex and yacc as well. Flex and bison
can help you out, but no support is included.

Just have a look in the Makefile and change:

CFLAGS
LIBS
INSTALLDIR
MANDIR

when you don't like the defaults.

type make and try some of the examples.
