W i n L u p e 6.70 - faster than light
======================================

Winlupe is a magnifying glass onto your monitor screen! Winlupe can run as
an accessory or Application under all TOS versions. Includes the Source
code in Pure C and assembler.


What can Winlupe do for you?
----------------------------

* Winlupe enables precise mouse positioning whatever the Application.
* Proofing of raster graphic images.
* Can be used in Applications which either provide no Zoom function or
  the Zoom function is so badly implemented as to be unusable!

You can obtain the latest version of Winlupe by sending me a disk containing
some decent PD Software together with an SAE, stating whether you want the
English or German version.
Alternatively the latest German version is available for download from the
following German Mailbox: MAUS S2

The latest English version can be downloaded from the following BBSs:

CIX: 081 390 1244 On the Internet: cix.compulink.co.uk
The Tavern: 081 445 6514, FNET 2:255/408, NEST 90:1004/1042

Winlupe is distributed using the Freeware principle which means that
everyone may use, copy and give copies to other users. PD libraries are an
exception and may only distribute Winlupe after obtaining my permission.

Whilst I have taken every precaution to ensure Winlupe works perfectly I
offer no guarantee and you use Winlupe at your own risk, see below!


Important advice
================

The Info file 'WIN_LUPE.INF' generated by Winlupe when the defaults are
saved are only compatible with the version of Winlupe which created it.
When you first use a different version of Winlupe ensure you delete the
old .INF file and create a new one, using the Save option. Ignore this
advice at your peril, if you are lucky you'll get an Error Message but a
crash is also possible!

Winlupe is programmed to be compatible with all (Multi)-TOS versions and
should run on all ST/STE/TT and Falcon models. Large screen monitors,
graphics cards and True Colour boards are also fully supported.


Setting up Winlupe
==================

Winlupe can run as an Application (.APP) or accessory (.ACC) by renaming
the file with the appropriate file extender shown above. Intergrated
On-line help is provided which explains each function in detail.

The memory requirement of Winlupe has been kept as low as possible without
comprimising speed. Around 8Kb is needed for internal tables and
altogether around 68Kb is used (including program code and files). Winlupe
also uses two screen buffers for the open zoom window. The maximum size
of the screen buffer on the ST is 96Kb and on the TT 456Kb. The Falcon
030 at maximum resolution needs somewhere around 2Mb but I guess nobody
will use Winlupe with Overscanned and Interlaced True Color Modes
(768*576*65536 Colours). In 640*480*256 Colours only 912Kb is needed.

If you are looking for maximum speed; select the 'Optimise window size &
position' and 'Enlarged cursor' options. Deselect the 'Real time scroll
bars' option. Set the Frequency to 100Hz and use one of the pre-defined
zoom factors (2/4/8/16). If you have a graphic card installed it is well
worth trying the Standard, Pixel packed and Interleave Modes. Performance
increases between 150% - 3000% are possible, compared to the pure VDI
routines.

Standard Mode should work in all mono-resolutions, including ST & TT high,
as the screen output is compatible with the VDI Standard Format.
The Pixel packed Modes work with Graphics cards where the individual
pixels are not organised in planes but directly behind one another in
memory. This is the case for many graphic cards in 8/15/16/24/32 Bit modes
with corresponding 256/32768/65536/16.7 million colour options.
The Interleaved Mode is needed when the Pixel planes alternate behind one
another in memory. This works in all ST/TT resolutions including most of
the Falcon graphic modes, except True Color Modes, for which the pixel
packed option should be used.

The 'AES compatibility mode' activates the vital wind_update() call which
avoids redraw problems caused when screen elements overlap the zoom
window.

Winlupe was programmed using Pure C from Applications Systems Heidelburg
using my own extended GEM Dialog Library (EnhancedGEM).


How fast is Winlupe? (all times in milliseconds (ms))
-----------------------------------------------------

The times below were all taken in ST high resolution with the Zoom window
at full screen with the 'Optimise window size & position' deselected. This
is the slowest possible case. Using the blitter results in around a three
times speed increase.
