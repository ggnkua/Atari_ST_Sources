Only one file needs to be changed in the general case:

  1- Makefile -- change TANKDIR to be the directoy in which the scorefile
                 and various data files are kept.
                 define GAMEDIR if you wish.  check the CFLAGS options.

However, you can check to make sure that the options in
c_config.h are as you like them.

  if you have imake, you can run xmkmf.  Otherwise, you should copy
  Makefile.orig to Makefile
  
  type 'make' or 'make install'

  Make sure the score file is either writeable or run this program suid.
  The help file and message of the day should be world readable.

  Report any problems/fixes to mummert+@cs.cmu.edu
