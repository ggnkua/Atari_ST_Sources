This is a much modified version of the public domain spread sheet vc,

I have completely reworked the user interface.  The save file format is
different so I have included a sed script, cvt.sed, which will convert to
the new file formats.  I have also added lots of new features and fixed
lots of bugs.  Any bugs you find at this point are probably mine.
I would love to hear from you if you have any problems.

The code has been tested against a Vax running 4.2 and a National ICM-3216 
with system V.2.  The ICM has a National Semi 32016.  Just check the makefile
for the system flags.

Good luck with the tax man.
