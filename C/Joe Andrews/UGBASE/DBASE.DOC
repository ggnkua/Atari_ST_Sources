This program is free.  You may distribute it freely to anyone  who 
will accept it.


   UGbase  is a simple data base program that will keep  track  of 
members  in a user's group.  It has a limited sort capability  and 
two different types of printer output. I am still working on this 
program and will upload the updated versions at a later time.  The 
new  version  will include a more advanced sort,  plus  search  and 
selective print options. These should be coming RSN.

  To use UGbase,  simply load it in and go.  Be sure that the file 
'DBASE.RSC' is in the same directory as the program.  If not,  you 
won't  get  too  far.  The program runs only  in  medium  or  high 
resolution.  When  the menu appears,  you can select a variety  of 
options.  Most functions will be familiar to most of you,  but I'll 
cover them anyway.

  The 'File' menu is where most of the editing options are  found. 
At  the top of the list is 'New'.  This will let you start with  a 
clean slate.  Use 'Open' to load in a previously saved  file.  The 
program  checks  to see whether the file is in UGbase  format  and 
will let you know if it isn't. Then there's 'Save' which will save 
the current file in memory to disk under the file name you  loaded 
the  program under.  'Save as' will allow you to input a new  file 
name  to save the file under.  'Erase' erases the current file  in 
memory.  It  works just like 'New' except that you  aren't  thrown 
into the input dialog box.  'Edit' will open up the dialog box and 
allow you to edit the file in memory.  Of course, 'Quit' will exit 
UGbase and return you to the desktop.

   In the 'Options' menu,  you'll find 'Sort',  which simply sorts 
the  data base by last name only.  In future versions,  you'll  be 
able to sort by any one or a number of fields.  But for now,  last 
names will have to do.   'Print' will let you print out records in 
three  different  style.  I'll cover those  a  little  later.   At 
present, 'Search' is not available and is disabled.  


   When you first run UGbase,  you'll need to select  'New'.  This 
will open up the input dialog box where you will enter in all  the 
data.  Simply  type  in  the appropriate  data  into  each  field, 
pressing  either 'Tab' or the up and down arrows to  move  between 
fields.   When adding new names to the file,  select 'Add' in  the 
Edit box at the bottom of the dialog.  This will add the record to 
the end of the file and step you to the next free record. Continue 
this way until all records are entered.  After you enter the  last 
record,  instead of pressing 'Add', press 'Update'. This will save 
the record in memory as in Add,  but will not open up a new entry. 
Update  is also used for editing or updating an individual  record 
in the file.  You can delete any entry by pressing 'Delete'.  This 
will  erase  the  record from memory and move  all  the  remaining 
records up to fill the gap.  You can also view any record by using 
the Viewing buttons on the bottom left of the dialog.  'Next'  and 
'Prev' will move you forward and backward through the file,  while 
'Start'  and 'End' will move you to the first and last records  in 
the file, respectively.

    When you have finished entering all records,  press 'Exit'  to 
return to the menu.  If you are working on a new file, you'll need 
to use 'Save as' and enter a file name to save the file  under.  If 
you've  already saved the file,  UGbase will use the file name  you 
saved or loaded it under.

   To sort the data base, simply select 'Sort' under the 'Options' 
menu.  This  will sort the file by ascending  alphabetical  order. 
Sort  only works on Last names.  All else is ignored.  As  I  said 
earlier, future versions will allow you to sort by any category in 
either direction.

    To print your file,  select 'Print' under the 'Options'  menu. 
You'll  be prompted with a dialog box giving you  several  options 
such as column or label printout,  as well as regular or condensed 
print.  If  you  select 'Column' you can only print  in  condensed 
print and the buttons will change to let you know.  If you want  a 
title to your printout, just enter in in at the bottom of the box. 
The  print  routines  work on Star and Panasonic  printers  so  it 
should work on other Epson compatabiles,  but I can't say for sure 
because I haven't tried them.
  
  The disabled boxes labeled 'All' and 'Selective' will be used in 
future  versions  to let you print out only records  matching  the 
search criteria.  This will be working shortly and will be in  the 
next version.

   That's about it.  This is my first project in C and on the  ST, 
so the source code probably leaves a lot to be desired.  There are 
probably a few bugs still lurking around, too, so if you find any, 
leave me mail for J.K.ANDREWS.  I realize you could do this easily 
with DB Master One,  but I had to do something productive and this 
was something our club needed. Due to my inadequices in Megamax C, 
data base size is limited to 100 records.  Any more than that  and 
I'd cross the 32k limit on segment space.  If any of you know  how 
to  get  around  this,  please let me know.  The  source  code  is 
included so any of you with Megamax can modify and customize it to 
suit your taste.  Also,  if your printer is not Epson  compatible, 
you can go in and modify the printer codes to fit your situation.
