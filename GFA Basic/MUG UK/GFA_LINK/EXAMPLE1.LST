' Example loading routine #1
'
' This example shows how, once created, it is so easy to access any file
' within the link file.
'
' Don't forget you retain all the benefits of only 1 file being used
' so cluster space isn't wasted and it is that little bit harder to access
' by the nosey people out there - and if you pack all the data files, you
' also stop compilation groups repacking your files and altering data files.
