InterActive supported software scheme                    19th February 1997
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
About the scheme
----------------
The supported Shareware scheme was started by Joe Connor in 1993 to 
encourage authors to produce and support English language versions of 
their software AND to encourage UK users to register 'foreign' software. 
Recently the scheme was re-launched as InterActive. With currently over 
1700 registrations the scheme has established the proven benefits of local 
support, which include:

- Key to remove features reserved for registered users available
- Local telephone, post and Email support
- Free update service
- No hassle handling foreign currency
- Labelled Master disk and registration letter
- ST-Guide on-line hypertext help (some software)
- Other software (dependent on disk space)

Registration fees are set to cover the currency handling, stationary, 
media and postage costs incurred in mailing out master disks and providing 
support.
Although primarily a UK support scheme everyone is welcome to register via 
InterActive as an alternative to registering directly with the author/s.

The currently supported software is:

How to register from inside the UK
----------------------------------
1) Use the included ORDER_FM.TXT to select the required software
2) Make sure your name and address is included and *legible*!
3) Make cheques/POs payable to InterActive for the total amount
4) Send the completed order form and payment to InterActive

Additionally from outside the UK
--------------------------------
- Add œ1 to your order total to cover postage
- Make certain payment is *in Sterling* drawn on a *UK* bank address
  The following methods are known to work:
  -Bank draft/cheque
  -Eurocheque
  -International Post Office cheque payable *in Sterling*
  -Cash! Sterling, Dollars and DMs are fine -but at your own risk!
  
Country specific information
----------------------------
Canada:    Canadian Post Office money orders made out in *Sterling* are 
           perfect and inexpensive!
Australia: Please visit your Post Office and get a money order made out in 
and NZ     *Sterling*.
France:    For some reason I'm getting a number of local cheques (i.e. 
           written in Sterling but drawn on a french bank address.
           I can accept these but they cost œ5 to negoiate so you must add 
           an extra œ5 to your order total.
Europe:    In general Post Office money orders or Eurocheques are the best 
           way to pay.
USA:       What a nightmare! Can I suggest a day trip to a Canadian post 
           office? I've seen everything from Amex travellers cheques (add 
           œ5 to order total), local cheques (no can do), cash (fine -but 
           at your own risk). An International money order (add œ5 to 
           order total) made out in Sterling drawn on a UK banking address 
           is currently the best solution.

Update service
--------------

By post
-------
To receive an update send a self addressed envelope including return 
postage (or IRC) and an unlabelled double sided floppy disk. Please state 
clearly:

1) The software you'd like updated
2) The version you're currently using
   
How long will I have to wait?
-----------------------------
Due to the number of people taking advantage of the service and my other 
commitments as editor of Atari Computing I can't always reply as quickly 
as I'd like to. Often I'm waiting for a new version or simply too busy 
earning a living so please be patient!

If you have Internet access
---------------------------
Visit the InterActive websites which includes news and gossip about the 
latest products with links to other Atari related sites and (any day now) 
downloads of all the latest versions.

If you have a modem but no ftp access
-------------------------------------
You can always obtain the latest English language releases from 42BBS:

SysOp:     Colin Fisher-McAllum
Telephone: UK+(0)1256 895106
System:    24 hour/28.8K modem/Falcon/8N1

Other Bulletin boards and ftp sites are allowed to carry the on-line 
archives but because minor updates to the English language version are 
sometimes made without changing the version number hensa and 42BBS are the 
places to go to ensure you have the very latest versions!

Regards

Joe Connor
