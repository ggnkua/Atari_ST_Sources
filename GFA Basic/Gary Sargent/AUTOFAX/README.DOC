AUTOFAX FOR THE ATARI ST SERIES COMPUTER

This collection of programs and files comprise a weather facsimile 
receiving capability for the Atari ST series of computers.  This 
system features several advanced characteristics to make the 
process of receiving facsimile signals more enjoyable.  These 
programs have been tested on both Atari 520 and 1040 ST (color and 
monochrome) and works properly.  It has not been tested on any of 
the newer ST's.

The following files are a part of this package:

     o README.DOC    You are reading it now!

     o AUTOFAX.DOC   This is an ASCII file containing the text of
                     user's manual for the system.

     o AUTOFAX.BAS   This is the AUTOFAX BASIC program, as written
                     by the language GFA BASIC 2.0.  This file is 
                     only usable by GFA BASIC.

     o NAMSAT.PI3    This is a satellite FAX chart as received
                     from Navy station NAM.  It is a DEGAS high
                     resolution image file.

     o NAM1945.DAT   This is another satellite FAX chart as recieved
                     from Navy station NAM.  It is the native Autofax
                     file format.

     o FAXASM.PRG    This a short program that is required by
                     AUTOFAX.  It is usable only by AUTOFAX.

     o GFABASRO.PRG  This is the 'run only' version of the
                     programming language GFA BASIC.  Running this
                     program on the Atari ST will  allow  running 
                     the AUTOFAX program.

     o SAMPLE.SCH    This is a sample FAX receiving schedule as
                     shown in Figure 7 of the article.  This is a
                     simple ASCII text file.

As described in the AUTOFAX.DOC users's manual, this program 
requires a tone detecter interface between your shortwave 
receiver's audio output and the serial port of your ST computer.  
The circuit diagram (and other figures mentioned in AUTOFAX.DOC) 
are not included here, but are available for $5 from:
