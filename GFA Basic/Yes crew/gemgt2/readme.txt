             ======================================
                   ****  GemGT2 Player  ****
   
  
  GemGT2 is GT2 modules player for Falcon 030 computer.
  
  GemGT2 supports  AVSERVER.  That means, that in multitasking OSes
like MiNT or Magic with  AVSERVER running (Thing or Jinnee desktop)
u can install GemGT2 as  *.GT2 player/viewer.  Double clicks on any
*.GT2 file then load GemGT2 and load file automatialy. If GemGT2 is
already loaed, doubleclick on *.GT2 file, loads that file in GemGT2
and plays it. Same happens, if u drag GT2 file to GemGT2  window or
its Taskbar entry.

  In TOS only commandline is supported. So if u have GemGT2 as your
*.GT2 application, u can drag GT2 file to GemGT2.PRG or duble click
it. After GemGT2 is loaded, u can only load new files via load icon

  There are still some problems:
  
  - Fast Forward and Rewind buttons act odd sometimes, they actualy 
    works, but action is few seconds delayed. Atm i have no clue why
    that happens.

  - Replay frequency toggle also work strange. It sems like it only  
    chang tempo. Also it  wont restore  original speed  (press play 
    again for that)  or it  resets to original  frequency on end of 
    pattern...

  - It won't work on CT60, due to DSP comunicating problem
