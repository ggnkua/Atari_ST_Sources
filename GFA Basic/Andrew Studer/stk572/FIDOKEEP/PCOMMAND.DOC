      You may register your copy of PCommand with Solid Applications
      for $25.00.  You will receive a copy of the full documentation
      and a disk containing the desk accessory version of PCommand
      along with some useful utilities including a format program which
      creates diskettes that can be read on an IBM PC (both single and
      double sided disks).
      
      
      
      WHAT IS PCOMMAND:
      
      Command  is  a  line-oriented  command  line interpreter with
      batch file support.   It provides an interactive interface to Atari
      TOS which runs on the Atari ST.   Commands are similar to PC-DOS
      commands  PCommand provides faster access to TOS facilities than
      the GEM desktop.  Multiple commands can be entered on a single line
      for even better efficiency.
      
      Command has a number of built-in commands which are always available
      and can run GEM or TOS-based applications by simply typing their name.
      A list of local commands is displayed by typing HELP.  The batch file
      facility can be used to present GEM-based menus and alert boxes.  This
      allows a GEM interface to be built using a text editor to create a
      batch file.  Most text editors available for the ST will work.

      BUILT-IN COMMANDS
      
      Command has a number of built-in commands which can be entered
      directly or used in batch files.   There is also a small set of
      commands which can only be used within a batch file.  The following
      is a list of built-in commands.

         * indicates batch file use only.
      
      
      Multiple commands are placed on a line by separating them with
      an exclamation point, '!'.  Command lines can be up to 160
      characters.  Labels are the GOTO command are names immediately
      preceeded by a colon, ':'.  Any text after a label is assumed to
      be a comment.
      
      Batch file parameters are indicated by a leading percent sign, '%'.
      A single digit after '%' indicates a parameter to the batch file.
      The parameter relaces both the percent sign and digit.  Any of the
      following special characters can be used if the percent sign is
      immediately followed by a colon, ':'.
      
          %:c       first character from last INPUT result
          %:d       disk letter from last GEM :FILE command

          %:f       file name   from last GEM :FILE command
          %:i       string from last INPUT result
          %:p       path name   from last GEM :FILE command
          %:v       video mode (0=low, 1=medium, 2=mono)
          %::       current time
          %:/       current date
      
      
      BUILT-IN COMMANDS
      
      General syntax: optional items are placed within square
      brackets such as [XYZ].  Alternatives are separated by a
      vertical bar as with ON|OFF.  Repeated items are followed by
      ellipses (...).  Note, keywords do not have to be capitalized
      when used.

                               ON prints the STACK status and allows
                               the system to be restarted at the
                               specified point.
           BELL                Sounds the bell.
           BREAK [ON|OFF]      PCommand recognizes control-C and ESC

                               while a 'file' is in the list.  Names with
                               wild card characters cause a directory to

            GEM [ON|OFF|command|:option]
                               Set/show GEM mode for .PRG files.

            NOTE: SQUARE BRACKETS AND '|' ARE REQUIRED HERE.
                      They do not imply an optional arguments.
      
            GEM :ALERT default [type][text][buttons]
                           'default' specifies the default button
                           where no default is 0.  The 'type' specifies
                           the icon type (0 to 3, see GEM documenation).
                           'text' and 'button' items are separated
                           by a '|'.  Three 'button's max.  The
                           %:e, ERRORLEVEL, variable is set to the
                           selected button (1 to 3)
            GEM :FILE [path] [file]
                           presents the GEM file selector menu.
                           'file' may be blank.  Results are in
                           %:f for the file name and %:p for the
                           path name, and %:d for drive letter.
                           %:e is 0 if OK is selected and 1 if
                           Cancel is selected.
            GEM :SELECT default [text][button]
                           General button selection which can have
                           more text and buttons than :ALERT but
                           no icon option.  'text' can be as wide as
                           the screen (less 2 characters).
            GEM :INPUT [text][valid]
            GEM :INPUT [text][valid|format]
            GEM :INPUT [text][valid|format|default]
            GEM :INPUT [text][valid|format|default|output]
                           General single line text input menu.
                           'text' is like :ALERT and :SELECT and
                           appears at the top of the menu.  The
                           text entered is place into %:i.  The
                           'valid', 'format', 'default' and 'output'
                           options control what can be entered.  The
                           'valid' string can contain any of these:
      
                     9         digits 0 to 9
                     A         uppercase letters and space
                     a         any letter and a space
                     N         uppercase letters, digits and a space
                     n         any letter, digits and a space
                     F         file name characters plus : ? *
                     f         file name characters plus :
                     P         path name characters plus : \ ? *
                     p         path name characters plus : \
                     X         any character
      
                               'format' and 'output' specify where the
                               actual text goes using '_' and all other
                               characters are decoration.
                               
              Examples:
      
               GEM :INPUT [An example:][XXXXXXXXXXXXXX]
