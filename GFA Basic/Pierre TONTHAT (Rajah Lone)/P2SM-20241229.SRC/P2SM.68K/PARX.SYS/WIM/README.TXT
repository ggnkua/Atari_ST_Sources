To avoid Write Image Module selection at every image saving (like in D2M),
P2SM need to have the .WIM filenames unchanged.
You may want to replace GIF.WIM or XIMG.WIM, but keep the same filenames.

Also, P2SM is set to avoid .WIM parameters change; for exemple, the program
change its VDI palette to VDIX (shifter order) for XIMG format.

NEO and PI1/PI3 images format are managed internaly when saving to files.
