@{0U}                                  Installation and system requirements@{0}

  16 colors 640*400 pixels screen is the minimum required.

  A modern operating system such as MagiC or MiNT is strongly advised,
  with an optimized VDI like NVDI.

  Requires the "EdDI" cookie to display on graphic cards.
  Falcon and new machines such as Milan have this by nature.
  If you have a graphic card with an old operating system, you'll need NVDI.
 
  The program uses plenty of memory, moreover on high-colored screens.
  So if you have not enough space or if the game becomes slower, run
  it in 640*480 16 colors.
  
  Location is important to access graphics and datas, the folder keeping
  XEDITOR.PRG, XEDITOR.HYP, XEDITOR.RSC must be besides XENON2.DAT, such as:
  
  XENON2.PRG
  XENON2.DAT\*
  XENON2.DAT\IMAGES\*
  XENON2.DAT\COLORS\*
  XENON2.DAT\DATAS\*
  XENON2.UTL\XEDITOR.PRG
  XENON2.UTL\XEDITOR.RSC
  XENON2.UTL\XEDITOR.HYP

  Loading images is much quicker if the cache (for same screenmode) has been
  build by XENON2.PRG. The cache location and availability is known by reading
  the XENON2.INF file. $HOME variable should be set in modern GEM environment. 

  ST-Guide installation is required if you want to call the
  documentation directly from the program. Make it as *.ACC or
  declare its path in the environment variable STGUIDE$.
  ie in MAGX.INF, #_ENV STGUIDE=C:\ST-GUIDE.ACX

  - Select edited level with the menu entry.
  
  - Map window and sprites set window, populated with map datas,
    accordingly to the selected level.
    
  - Select one item in the sprite set, then draw it to the map.
    The map is 16*16 squared.
    
    Mobile creatures are not sprited-drawn, but displayed with a line and text.
    A line represent the moment when the scrolling will trigger their display.
    For grouped creatures (3 or more), select and put just one.
  
  - If you want to delete something on the map, 2 methods:
    1) unselect the item in the sprites set, 
       and left-click on the choosen zone on the map.
    or
    2) keep your choice in the sprites set,
       and right-click on the choosen zone on the map.
    
  - If the item is greater than 16*16 pixels, click on the upper-left corner
    of the sprite or text.
    
  - Selecting the capsule in sprite window opens a pop-up where you can select
    its contents. Then put it in the map in X,Y. Ingame, the capsule appears
    at 0,Y position. If you want to delete it, erase it at X,Y location.

  - Crispin's shop: select each level and fill the racks with items to buy.

@{0U}                                Specific notes specific to each levels@{0}

  @{0B}Level 1@{0}
  - There is not mid-boss, only the amonit end-boss, thus only stop at
    the shop at end of level, instead of two in the other levels.

  @{0B}Level 2@{0}
  - Tiny caterpilar with one shot should be placed on vertical surface,
    it goes down, fire its bullet and then stops.

  @{0B}Level 3@{0}
  - Crawler with bouncing spit should be placed on horizontal surface,
    its bullet is fired when a void below or a blocked path is encountered,
    then goes the opposite way.
  - Tiny crab should be placed on plane. Its behavior is to walk on the
    surface and go the opposite way if void below or blocking element is
    encountered.

  @{0B}Level 4@{0}
  - Jumper and toad walk verticaly to the bottom, put them on vertical surface.

  @{0B}Level 5@{0}
  - Octogone ships suite should be placed in a clear area (starting in the
    center of the screen, direction to the left, empty space at the right for
    the next octogones ships).
    It's important to use the slantwise stone elements of the scenery to guide
    these ships.
  - Condoit (fire 8 stars-shaped blasts) can have damaged stone element on the
    left and right. Place them besides in the editor. In the game, these will
    be displayed as stone elements until the Condoit destruction.
  - Static Multi-Directional Laser Canon can have damaged artefact on the left
    and right. place them besides the Canon in the editor. In the game, these
    will be displayed as artefacts elements until the Canon destruction.
  - Last stop in the shop between end-boss destruction and subspace greetings,
    the winner items will be fixed ingame and not editable.
