@{0U}What Meg does?                                                         @{0}

 @{0B}Meg@{0} is a small program for checking POP3 and IMAP4 mailboxes,
 with filtering against spam.

 Meg runs on Atari computers, emulators or clones under TOS, MagiC
 or MiNT (>= 1.17.0).

  @{0U}Features:@{0}

  ú looks automatically in several mailboxes you have declared
    (POP3 or IMAP4 protocols).
  ú can use secure connection with the library POLARSSL.LDG 
    (POP3S, POP3 with STLS, IMAPS, IMAP4 with STARTTLS protocols).
  ú counts the mails received.
  ú if the mail comes from a declared friend, the mail is always accepted.
  ú discards, moves or deletes emails with some rules you have given.
    and, if deletion, writes some infos in a log file.
  ú can import email accounts and email addresses from TROLL's datalist.
  ú warns you in its iconified window, a message in AtarIRC, or a sound alert.
  ú launches the email client, if mail has been detected, with
    a single click on the iconified window (MagiC). Under MiNT,
    uniconify the window and click the button, or just top the
    iconified window and press space key.

  This program is a Renaissance product and Freeware.

  No fee is asked for its use.
  Copy is legal and strongly advised.

  Meg was written after a hard study of the GFA source of
  Fr‚d‚ric FOUCHE's POPGEM. So Meg has to be provided open-source.

@{0U}Install and requirements                                               @{0}

 @{0U}Meg needs:@{0}

 ú A multitasking environment is stronly advised, with iconification
   support. An AV Server or MagiC is needed to watch the log file or
   listen the sound alert.

 ú STinG TCP/IP layer is advised under TOS or MagiC.

   Under MiNT, launch gluestik.prg before to install the STiK cookie.
   With FireBee, use its option "--force" to supersede the STiK functions
   of FireTOS.
   Gluetick is only used for the STiK cookie and its resolver function
   (that translates domains into IP address). MiNTnet sockets are used
   directly.

 @{0U}Installation:@{0}

 > Copy MEG.APP and MEG.RSC together in the same folder.
   The DATAS folder may be located beside the PRG file.

 > Launch MEG.APP and goto the preferences to set the location of
   the DATAS folder, choose the names of the files, etc.

 > In your desktop program, you should link the *.AVR or *.WAV sound
   alert file to an application (ie GEMJing), same with the
   *.LOG file (ie EvereST).

 > Secure connections are supported: POP3S, POP3 with STLS, IMAPS, IMAP4 with
   STARTTLS. You need the POLARSSL.LDG library.
  
   LDG.PRG must be launched (in AUTO folder or manualy after) to add the
   LDGM cookie.
   These files must be located in the LDG folder (usualy C:\GEMSYS\LDG\):
   - POLARSSL.LDG (mandatory)
   - POLARSSL.CA (optional, for servers certificates verification)
   - Folder POLARSSL.CS (optional, for using external ciphersuites files)

   These files are provided in a separate archive "POLARSSL.ZIP".

@{0B}Paths:@{0}

  @{0U}Email client@{0}
   Application installed on your Atari system that manage retreiving,
   repository and display of emails. If emails are detected and counted, click
   on the "launch mail client" to call it. If Meg's main window is iconified,
   a click is enough under MagiC environmenent. Under MiNT and XaAES, you'll
   have to top the iconified window and press 'space' key.
    
  @{0U}ST-Guide documentation@{0}
   Path and name of MEG.HYP.
    
  @{0U}Data folder@{0}
   Meg's data folder, where emails accounts, friends' emails addresses,
   filters and actions are listed in files.
    
  @{0U}Use a log file@{0}
   If enabled, description of deleted emails are logged here.
   Sender, date, size, subject, filter, and non-formated text are stored.

    
@{0B}Notify:@{0}

    - No sound effect (default)
 or - Notify with a digitalized sound (use ARV or WAV, and in the desktop,
      link this file type with a player that supports VA_START such as
      GEMJing).
 or - Notify with the system bell.
   
   It's possible to display the number of detected emails and the total size
   in KB in other applications: AtarIRC and AtarICQ.


@{0B}Schedule:@{0}
   
   Check is manual by default. Here, one can set an automatic check every N
   minutes. Better use Meg as ACCessory or use a multitask environment.
   
   If set, and if modern AES, then Meg iconify itself at next start.

  
@{0B}Security:@{0}

    @{0U}Verify servers certificates@{0}
      If set, the POLARSSL.CA file is loaded, parsed, and used at connection
      start to verify the certificates. If the server certificate is not
      valid, then an alert appears for the user to accept or reject the
      connection.
      If the certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), then
      it is automaticaly accepted.
      
      Disabling verification uses less RAM and time, but it lowers security.

      This option in disabled under TOS.
      If the POLARSSL.CA is not found, then verification is disabled.   

    @{0U}Accepted protocols@{0}
      From lighter to heavier: SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2
      The lighter asks less computations and therefore less delay 
      at connection start (SSL Handshake step).
      
      For quickness: lower maximum.
      For better security: increase minimum.

    @{0U}Preferred ciphersuites file@{0}
      SSL Handshake may take too long and fail because of heavy or buggy
      ciphersuites. You can choose wished ones in the POLARSSL.CS folder
      by selecting a *.CS file.
      
      If not selected, then POLARSSL.LDG will use its built-in ciphersuites.

@{0U}Mailboxes - emails accounts                                            @{0}

  - The "+" button is to add new emails accounts.
  Choice is between POP3 and IMAP4 types, or import all emails accounts items
  used in Troll email client (use the same HOME folder).
  
  It's advised to use IMAP4 connection: quicker and safer, detection is better
  for attachments and text content (BODYSTRUCTURE and BODY.PEEK[TEXT]).
  
  More actions are possible with IMAP4: move to Junk folder, move to Trash
  folder, move to another custom folder.

  It's not advised to user POP3 connection: one attachment can only be listed,
  and the text content may be not retreived (128 first lines of the RFC822 
  message is downloaded for analysis).

  Actions are limited with POP3 (count, do not count but keep, delete).

  - The "?" button allows to edit and modify the email account. Same effect
  as a double-click on the listed item.
 
  - The "-" button deleted the email account. A confirmation alert is displayed
  to warn. The related filters will be deleted in the configuration with
  the selected email account.

  - The "" et "" buttons re-order the mailboxes sequence check. First to
  be checked is at the top. Last is at the bottom.

  
  It's possible to disable one or more accounts for the check. 
  Disabled accounts appear lightened in the list.

@{0U}Email addresses or friends                                             @{0}

  - The "+" button is to add one or two emails addresses of a friend or a
  mailing-list. It's possible to import all the emails addresses from Troll
  email client (use same HOME folder).
      
  - The "?" button allows modifications on a selected item. Same as double-clic.
  - The "-" button is to delete the item.
   
  @{0U}Notes:@{0}

  - Can be considered as a "WhiteList". If the email address of the sender is
  located in this list, then the message is OK, not filtered, and will be
  counted as true email.
 
  If you want to sort messages, ie move some emails to specific folders, then
  do not declare emails in this list, use an IMAP4 account, add filters and use
  these filters on the top-list, can will be triggered first.

  - Friends and mailing-lists are alphabeticaly sorted by name when Meg starts.

@node "meg_filter" "Meg documentation"
@{0U}Filters and actions                                                    @{0}

  A filter is always related to an email account and is always linked to an
  action. IMAP4 access allows to move messages to folders (Junk, Trash, custom).

  - The "+" button adds a filter.
  - The "?" button or double-click modifies the selected filter.
  - The "-" button deletes/removes the selected filter.
  @{0B}Careful: there is no confirmation alert for filter remove.@{0}

  - The "" et "" allows to re-order the filter in the list. Each filters are
  tested for every message. First is at top, last is at bottom.
  This can be useful for:
  ú put first/at top the filters for sorting and moving to custom IMAP4 folders.
  ú make quicker spam detection.
  If triggered, the next filters are discarded.
  
  @{0U}Notes:@{0}
  
  - Subjects, sender and recipients, text/plain contents are decoded since
  1.5 version. Supported charsets are iso-latin-1, windows-1252, iso-latin-2,
  utf-8. Supported transfer encoding are 7bit, 8bit, base64 and
  quoted-printable.
  - These charsets are always accepted, even if you filter with wanted encoding
  in subject or text content filter.
  
  - a clic on editable field for encoding opens a pop-up where some encodings
  are listed. One can still modify the encoding by hand.
  
  - IMAP4 connection is better for text content detection and list of all
  attachments.
  - IMAP4 connection also allows message move to Junk, Trash or custom folders.
  When custom folder is choosen, then Meg connects to the server to make a list
  of unflagged folders. Select one of then in the pop-up selector.
  The IMAP server must use \Junk and \Trash flags, if not, the junked or trashed
  message is left in the INBOX, but not counted.
  
  - If harsh deletion is choosen, then it's advised to enable the log file.

          iconified window, top this window and press space. 
   Thanks to Lars SCHMIDBAUER

  @{0B}1.3C@{0}
   - chg: usage of AES extensions for internal menu
          (WF_MENU with wind_set()).

   - username field is enlarged (mailboxes datafile is
     automaticaly converted).

  @{0B}1.2F@{0}
   - fix crash at launch under MiNT with Memory Protection

  @{0B}1.2E@{0}
   - 'Bcc' removed for the search

                      of the mailbox is different from the email)
   - scan is desactivated while the mail client is running
   - new POP3 receive routine (quicker, maybe less freezing)
   - bugfix of the iso8859->atari conversion routine
   - bugfix of size(s) of mail(s) announced
   - more memory for analysis
   (Thanks Kenneth ;))

  @{0B}1.2C@{0}
   - bugfix of 'From', 'To', 'Subject', etc detection failure if
     they were in major case (fool trick of spams). Detection of the
     fields of the mail header is now case unsensitive. With this bug,
     the spams were always accepted if some friends were declared.
     (Thanks Kenneth ;))

  @{0B}1.2B@{0}
   - bugfix of filter 'case sensitive' string search in Body
   - bugfix of freeze if authentification has failed
   - work-around for $HOME on MiNT ext2 partition (save the MEG.INF
     beside the program if it cannot write in $HOME folder)

  @{0B}1.2@{0}
   - bugfix of 'Save' item menu : now active
   + alert to save datas when leaving (if datas have been modified)
   - bugfix in 'To + Cc' string search (was searching only in 'To')
   + optionnal case sensitivity for string search
   + new type of 'friend' : mailing-list (Email3 is deprecated)
     -> declare a mailing-list, so you can use the 'To + Cc' is not for me
        and keep mails coming from this mailing-list
   + New size filter : range of size (>=X and <=Y). If you want to delete
        all mail with size (>=X), use only the first numeric field.
   + Spam size is notified in the log file
   + Total size of mails is indicated in a bubble upon the icon
     (only if bubble deamon is set)

  @{0B}1.1@{0}
   - bugfix of 'To' and 'Reply-To' field confusion
   - bugfix of several lines field detection (both tab and space)
   + new parameter : number of lines of mail body to retrieve for analyse
   + accessory mode (with no guarantee on stability, prefer APP mode in
     multitasking environment)
   + new filter : mail size
   + new notification type : in AtarICQ window
   + new notification type : system bell

  @{0B}1.0B@{0}
   - bugfix of "Cc" (Carbon copy) field read. Wasn't reading
     the next lines and mail addresses
   - bugfix of body mail read. Could cause a crash or a program freeze
