             DEditor is a dungeon editor for DGEM.

             This programs allows to build, deck out, put and populate a
             11*50*50 dungeon, in GEM environment.

             The edited files should be in the folder DGEM.DAT\DATAS and
             named MAZE.*

             It is possible to deny edition to others by indicating a
             password.

             DEditor can interact with DGEM, in multitasking environment:
             - changer location of the party.
             - force DGEM to relaod its dungeon.
             This for testing.

@image DRAGON.IMG 1


              16 colors 640*400 pixels screen is the minimum required.

          A modern operating system such as MagiC or MiNT is strongly
          advised, with an optimized VDI like NVDI.

       ST-Guide installation is required if you want to call the
       documentation directly from the game. Make it as *.ACC or
       declare its path in the environment variable STGUIDE$.
       ie in MAGX.INF, #_ENV STGUIDE=C:\ST-GUIDE.ACX

       Copy DEDITOR.PRG and its RSC beside, where you want, and configure
       its options.

              @{0U}Editing modes@{0}
              Several editing modes, in the menu. Select one and a list-window
              appears.

          Then select a tile (or quarter-tile) in the main window.

         - @{0B}Build@{0}: walls, stairs, pits, etc. All that is unmovable.
         Select the pattern in the window and paint/design your dungeon in
         the main window.
         No pattern selected or right-click is void tile.

    For the list-window of wall/ground item, object or monsters:
     '+' to add
     '?' to edit
         (a blank item or apple or mummy is created by default)
     '' and '' to sort
         (if wall/ground item, only the top item is displayed)
     '-' to delete

         - @{0B}Deck out@{0}: wall or ground items. Theses can be ornements,
         mecanisms, buttons, generatos, doors, pads, alcoves...
         Only the first/top item will be displayed, but several can be
         created (see below) for multiple target mecanisms.

       ú Tip: several item of the same type on the same wall or position,
         each with different target, permits to act on several targets.
         For example: a pad (two pads in the list, each with different
         target) can open two different doors.

       ú Other tip: coinhole, and behind and alcove. If the coinhole target
         is the same location, then the coinhole will disappear if coin
         inserted and the alcove will appear instead.

       ú The 'target' is a ground or wall item that will be enacted if the
         current item is manipulated (ie a key in a keyhole will open a
         remote door).
         Due to difficult analysis, the target should be alone in the tile.
         If there's several items in the target tile, then the position is
         important : priority to the nord, then south, then east, then west.

       ú Advise: Atari computers runs at different speed running one or more
         programs, this program may be thus more or less reactive: you should
         not set mecanisms and trecks based on timing.

         - @{0B}Put@{0}: put the object, in quarter tiles. It is possible
         to put objects in alcoves (in deck-out mode) or on monsters (in
         populate mode).

         - @{0B}Populate@{0}: add the monsters. Only one monster or group
         of monsters in the list. 1 to 4, depends of the type of monster.

            ú Requires the "EdDI" cookie to display on graphic cards.
              Falcon and new machines such as Milan have this by nature.
              If you have a graphic card with an old operating system,
              you'll need NVDI.




     ú Many Memory Allocation via GEMDOS calls: old TOS and ST emulators
       won't appreciate. TOS 2.06 seems to be the minimum required.
