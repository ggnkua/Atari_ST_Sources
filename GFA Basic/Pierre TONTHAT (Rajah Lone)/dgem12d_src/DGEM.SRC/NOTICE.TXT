B - GFA COMPILATION

- use a patched GFA LIB (GFAPLIB, LicomLIB, Lonny Pursell's LIB)
- several compilator options are in the sources
- some more options are needed, use the default parameters of 
  the GFA Menu utilitary or specify: S< F> P< %0 *% E$
- it's very important that MUL() and DIV() use LONG words and not INT.

C - PROGRAM FLAGS

- you can set this flags with compiler options with Lonny Pursell's 
LIB or use FILEINFO.CPX or PRGFLAGS.PRG or ThingDesk.

2 cases:

a) the program is a 'serious' application: 
  FASTLOAD + PRG in TTRAM + MEM not in TTRAM 
  (the program do its mxalloc itself)
  'Private' for Memory Protection under MiNT 
  (the program do mxalloc with 'Global' when needed)

b) the program is a game and uses sounds:
  FASTLOAD + PRG not in TTRAM + MEM not in TTRAM 
  (the program do its mxalloc itself, it may contain 
  some INLINE routines like SNDH so the PRG should be in STRAM)
  'Super' for Memory Protection under MiNT 
  (the program do mxalloc with 'Global' when needed,
  but playing DMA sounds may be not safe with 'Private' flag)
