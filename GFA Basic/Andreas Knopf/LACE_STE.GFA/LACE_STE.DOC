Instruction to 'Lace STE':
This program makes it possible to use a higher resolution and more colors on
every STE. It uses a Screen switching technic to do interlace. 
Because of compatiblity problems I had to create this screen switching with
the help of a virtual screen of 640*200 pixel in low and 1280 pixel in mid
resolution. With the help of a VBL interrupt the computer switches between
two halfes of the virtual screen. 
I had to do it this way because of the VDI routines. The ST thinks the 
second half of the virtual screen would be the next line.

There are not so many programs that run with this software graphic card
well but nearly no program crashes with it. The big problem is that this
program is no high resulotion emulator so there run only programs which
are made for all resolutions or only for colour modes.
But a very nice thing is that GFA Basics 3.5 runs with this program.
To use the new resolution with GFA Basic you have to put the following
command at the start of your program:

Clip 0,0,320,400   (new low resolution, 320*400 pixel)
Clip 0,0,640,400   (new mid resolution, 640*400 pixel)

To use the new colours you have to do the following:

On every pixel with even y-position use a colour from 0 to 15
on every pixel with uneven y-position do the same as with the even ones.

To know what colour you use, you have to multiplicate the colour of the
even pixel plus one with the colour of the uneven pixel plus one.
( (even-colour+1) * (uneven-colour+1) )
Some examples:

Even colour  = 2
Uneven Colour=10
Real colour of the pixel: (2+1) * (9+1) = 30

Even colour  =15
Uneven colour=15
Real colour of the pixel: (15+1) * (15+1) = 256

One problem in this early version of Lace STE is the changing of the 256
on the same time possible colours.
At this version you have to load the source and edit the colours in it.
In the source you can find the two main palettes from which you can
mix the 256 colours. 
If you use $700 as colour one in the first  main palette and
           $070 as colour one in the second main palette
then you have a light yellow as the colour 4.
             
You can show with this program a little bit under 256 colours 
at a resolution of 320*400 pixel or 16 colours at a resolution of 640*400
pixel. The palette is nearly 16.7 million colours (more than a Falcon).

Plans for better versions in the future:
Overscan: max. 640*500 pixel
Raster  : 256 colours each line, 51200 colours on screen
Palette switching menu as accessory.

Planed programs to make use of Lace STE:
Paint 256 (Verion 0.1 is aviable)
The secret of donkey island (adventure)

If youself are planing to do something for this graphic expansion, then
put the name of your program in the list !!!
