           The not-reading-the-manual-phobia (DOCphobia)
           =============================================

           Dispite the fact, I have gone through great lengths in making
           this manual as complete as possible, I am frequently asked
           about things that are precicely described in this manual.

           I know reading a manual can be cumbersome, but it would save
           me, as the 7PLUS author, a lot of unnecessary work, if every
           7PLUS user who is having trouble, would take THIS MANUAL in
           hand and read it again thoroughly, before asking me.

           Of course, since nobody is perfect, I may have forgotten a
           few things here an there. Also some parts may not be very
           intelligible to beginners, although I tried hard to keep it
           simple.

           I cannot supply a MS_DOS/ATARI/AMIGA or UNIX course in this
           manual. Therefore you should be familiar with the basics of
           your computer and terminal program.


           Preface
           =======

           When sending data through the Packet Radio network, errors
           may occur in spite of the safety mechanisms incorporated into
           the AX25 protocol. One must bear in mind, that data may pass
           a lot of unprotocolled interfaces, where a simple impulse can
           alter it. Also upon transfer the data is passed through quite
           a lot of memory cells. On computers that don't use memory
           parity checking, memory errors may go undetected.

           Plain text with errors is still well legible for humans. We
           can correct or ignore errors (as long as numbers aren't
           falsified) and thus still understand what it meant. Even at
           an error rate of 10%, we can still get the meaning of the
           text.

           Things are very different when it comes to machine readable
           data as programs for instance. One error in 100000 bytes may
           cause the data to be completely worthless. A program affected
           by this would probably not run at all or at least not
           correctly, a picture may be damaged beyond recognition or may
           not be displayable at all.

           If a program was sent in the form of it's source text, it may
           be repaired, but only by those who have a profound knowledge
           of that programming language. For the mass of users, this is
           no help.

           Another problem is: How do you transfer a program or picture
           through a netnork of bulletin board systems (BBS) that are
           usually just meant to handle plain text?




                                                                                                                                                1

                                                                 Preface
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           The answer is to convert it to a format compatible with the
           BBSs. This task is done by so-called ASCII-encoders (short:
           encoder). The encoders used in the past had one common
           problem:

           - Did a file get corrupted, it was useless and had to be
             transfered again.

           - Some encoders wouldn't even recognize errors, so the files
             produces could actually do unexpected things! This ranged
             from simple crashes to destruction of data on the harddisk.

           - Some did recognize that there was an error, but wouldn't
             tell you where (in what file).

           - The overhead produced by those encoders was quite large and
             ranged between 27% up to 100% (!). To transfer a program of
             10K in length took up between 12,7K and 20K, depending on
             the encoder used.


           This situation was not very satisfying, so it was high time
           for an encoder that could handle the problem

           - by using checksums on each and every line of code, thus
             being able to recognize the exact position of errors,

           - by supplying a method of correting errors without having to
             resend entire files over and over again,

           - by correcting minor errors on the spot, and

           - by producing less overhead (ca.15%).

           The encoder that does all this - and more - is >> 7PLUS <<.


           The development of 7PLUS
           ========================

           7PLUS has been developed on the basis of my previous encoder
           SEVEN. 7PLUS however has the ability of detecting and correc-
           ting errors. These abilities had the price of incompatibility
           to SEVEN, however. This isn't so grave, since 7PLUS has a lot
           of advantages compared to SEVEN and now the repeated upload
           of files, that were corrupted in store & forward, is a thing
           of the past.

           Since 7PLUS was incompatible to SEVEN anyway, I implemented a
           RADIX216 encoding wich allows for very compact files.

           In the beginning, there was heavy opposition against 7PLUS.
           Some people were convinced that an encoder that uses charac-
           ters above 7Fh would create more trouble than do good.




                                                                                                                                                2

                                                The development of 7PLUS
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           7PLUS established itself as THE standard encoder in Germany
           very quickly. This proves the critics to be wrong. By now,
           7PLUS is not only used in Germany, but worldwide. There even
           are BBSs that use 7PLUS for file serving purposes.

           An inportant aspect is the fact, that 7PLUS is available for
           the most commonly used computer systems in Packet Radio:
           IBM_PC, ATARI_ST, AMIGA and UNIX systems.
           (There also are versions for the Apple MacIntosh and Acorn
           Archimedes. I don't have those versions, so ask around for
           them in the BBSs)


           The ASCII-encoder 7PLUS
           =======================

           From its conception, the Packet Radio protocol (AX.25) is an
           8 bit system. When only using 7 bits, the protocol is only
           used to 87.5% of its capacity. When encoding data only using
           a 6 or 7 bit algorithm, an unnecessarily high overhead is
           produced.

           7PLUS (all versions)

           - exploits the capacity of the network fully by using all 8
             bits,

           - creates the 7PLUS code lines in a way, that when decoding
             them, it can determine if a line was transfered correctly,

           - detects and protocols what lines were damaged or missing,

           - simplifies the exact reconstitution of corrupted files, by
             using an mainly automated method of correcting (with
             minimal cooperation between sender and recipient).


           Basic steps of a 7PLUS filetransfer
           ===================================

           1. OM A encodes the file TEST.TXT into TEST.7PL and uploads
              it to the Packet Radio network.

           2. OM B downloads TEST.7PL and tries to decode it.
              ...Unfortunately, the file has been damaged on its travel
                 through the network....

           3. OM B's 7PLUS detects the errors in TEST.7PL and produces a
              so-called metafile (TEST.7MF) where all the good lines are
              stored in their already decoded form and in addition an
              error report TEST.ERR. (TEST.7PL may be deleted at this
              point, since it is not needed for correcting)

           4. OM B sends TEST.ERR to OM A.




                                                                                                                                                3

                                                 The ASCII-encoder 7PLUS
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           5. With the help of 7PLUS, the original TEST.TXT and the
              error report TEST.ERR, OM A creates the correction file
              TEST.COR. He then sends the correction file to OM B or he
              uploads it as a bulletin, if it can be useful to others.

           6. OM B's 7PLUS then uses TEST.COR to fill in the gaps in the
              metafile TEST.7MF. If no gaps remain, 7PLUS frees the
              metafile of the index data contained in it, renames it to
              TEST.TXT and reconstitutes the file's timestamp.


           In case the file TEST.COR has been damaged as well, OM A has
           to send it again. Since the files TEST.ERR and TEST.COR are
           usually rather short, this way of correcting damaged files
           (points 3 through 6 above) is much more effective than
           resending entire parts again and again until they luckily get
           through undamaged.
           The whole concept of exchanging error report and correction
           files may sound complicated at first, but it isn't really.


           The 7PLUS correcting method is basically comprised of 5
           simple, but important steps:

             1. "At OM B: Decode and recognize faulty lines and memorize
                them in an error report TEST.ERR (automated),
             2. "Send error report TEST.ERR from OM B to OM A",
             3. "At OM A: Compile correction file TEST.COR" (automated),
             4. "Send correction file TEST.COR from OM A to OM B",
             5. "At OM B: Do the correction" (automated).

           If the correction file TEST.COR (for OM B) is downloaded by
           OM B2 (someone who also downloaded TEST.7PL) does not cover
           all faulty lines, he just has to run through the described
           steps 3-5, since his own special TEST.ERR has been generated
           when unsuccessfully tried to correct his TEST.7MF.

           Once OM A and OM B have successfully transfered a program or
           picture file this way, they will see that the whole concept
           is quite fool-proof.


           A helpful OM C, who has successfully decoded TEST.7PL can
           take the place of OM A by supplying correction files to his
           friends or to someone looking for it. Also, an automated
           station (e.g. an F6FBB-BBS running 7PSERV by SM0NCS) may well
           take over the job of supplying correction files!

           -------------------------------------------------------------

           7PLUS-theory
           ============

           The encoding scheme 7PLUS uses, could well be called a 7-
           three-quarter-bit encoding, because on the smallest scale, 31
           bits of the original data are encoded into 32 bits (4 charac-
           ters) of the 7PLUS code. That is one of the reason, why 7PLUS
           is called 7PLUS                           (Simple, isn't it?)

           7PLUS uses a RADIX216-algorithm for encoding.

           For 31 bytes of the original data, 32 7PLUS-bytes are
           produced. This causes an overhead of 1/32 = 3.125%.
           Because of the required line delimitors, checksums, head and
           foot lines, the overhead increases to about 13% to 15%.

           Simple encoding algorithms as RADIX64 (UUE), RADIX128 (SEVEN)
           are done by simple bit shifting operations (multiplications
           with 2^n and divisions by 2^n). Something, microprocessors
           can do with great speed.

           RADIX216 (7PLUS) is not based on multiples of 2, thus integer
           divisions and multiplikations are necessary which take consi-
           derably more time than simple bit shiftings.

           Some older microprocessors do not have direkt commands for
           multiplication and division of integers, so these operations
           have to be implemented by using add-shift-loops, which run
           relatively slowly. Divisions done that way are even slower.
           The microprocessors commonly used today (80X86, 680X0) how-
           ever all have direct commands for multiplikation and division
           of integers. That's why the 7PLUS algorithm will run at
           acceptable speeds on them.


           Encoding algorithm
           ------------------

           When encoding data, 7PLUS interprets 31 bits of the original
           data as the integer number N. This number is then divided
           through 216 for three times.

           Die divisional rests (A1, A2, A3) and the third quotient (A4)
           - can take one of 216 possible values (0 bis 215) and
           - represent 4 basic characters  (= 4 bytes = 32 bits) of the
             7PLUS code.

           After encoding of a group of 31 bytes of the original data, a
           7PLUS group of 32 basic characters is the result.

           The basic characters from the RADIX216 algorithm can however
           not be used directly as they still contain certain characters
           the are used for control purposes in the ASCII code. This is
           why each basic character is asigned a new one, that does not
           collide with any control character of the ASCII code.



                                                                                                                                                5

                                                            7PLUS-theory

           Character set
           -------------

           Characters used by the 7PLUS algorithm: (in HEX notation)

              21 - 29, 2B - 7E, 80 - 90, 92, 94 - FC (ranges including)

           Characters not used:

              00 to 20  : Control codes and the space character.

              2A        : The asterisk (*) must not be used, because
                        - by chance - the string '***end' could be
                        produced, thus causing the receiving TheBox-BBS
                        to end storage. (To my shame, I must admit, I
                        did not take the bulletin board systems used
                        outside of Germany into accout.. The file
                        termination '/EX' may be produced by chance! I
                        haven't received any complaints about this,
                        however. Axel)

              7F        : DEL, another control code.

              91 and 93 : Some telephone terminal programs mis-interpret
                        these characters as XON and XOFF (11h and 13h).

           When having problems storing all characters of the 7PLUS
           code, see 'Tips for configuring ...'.


           Decoding algorithm
           ------------------

           When decoding,
           - 7PLUS reads 4 characters of the 7PLUS code ( = 32 bits) and
           - regroups them into the four values  A1, A2, A3 and A4.

           The value N is then rebuilt:

           N = A1 + A2*216^1 + A3*216^2 + A4*216^3

           The value N now represents 31 bits of the original data
           (almost 4 bytes).
           After reading and decoding a full 7PLUS group of 32 charac-
           ters, 31 bytes of the original data are reconstituted.













                                                                                                                                                6

                                                            7PLUS-theory
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Automagic single byte correction
           --------------------------------

           Since version 1.60, 7PLUS uses a simple, but effective way to
           correct single byte errors on the spot, when

           - one byte per line is wrong, or
           - one byte is missing, or
           - one byte is superfluous.

           Upon decoding of a line, 7PLUS checks its validity by using
           the 'inner' checksum, wich has been there since 7PLUS v1.0 .
           In case of an error, 7PLUS tries to rebuild the line by
           testing all possible combinations (up to more than 14.000
           combinations). If a combination is found, where the 'outer'
           checksum (this checksum has been added since version 1.60 of
           7PLUS) tests ok, the result is checked again with the inner
           checksum, because at this point there may be more than one
           possible result. If both checksums test ok, then the line has
           been successfully rebuilt. If not, testing of combinations
           continues until either a valid combination is found or all
           combinations have been tested unsuccessfully.

           A situation where the inner AND outer checksum test ok and
           the line is still incorrect, is EXTREMELY unlikely. To add
           some more safety, the outer checksum is calculated inverse to
           the inner one (back to front).

           The single byte correction may take quite some time (up to
           three seconds) on slow computers, but if this feature can
           save the trouble of ordering a correction files, it's well
           worth the waiting. Also, single byte errors are not that
           frequent.


           I am well aware of the fact that there are better methods.
           The trouble is, they either have a much greater overhead or
           need extensive tables, wich is a problem in situations where
           there isn't much memory available (e.g. when called from
           within a terminal program or a computer running a bulletin
           board system).


           The structure of 7PLUS code files
           =================================

           7PLUS code files are generally comprised of
           - a header,
           - up to 512 lines of code and
           - a foot line.

           Each line is concluded with a CR/LF combination (on MSDOS and
           ATARI; on other systems a line delimitor complying with that
           system is used, e.g. LF on AMIGA/UNIX).
           During transfer via Packet Radio, the line delimitor is
           always and only the CR character.


                                                                                                                                                7

           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Transformation of CR/LF (LF with AMIGA/UNIX) into CR is done
           automatically by the terminal programs.

           Exception: When receiving or sending in the binary mode of
                     some terminal programs.

           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Single and multipart 7PLUS code files
           =====================================

           7PLUS uses a 9 bit line number for the numbering of the code
           lines. This allows for a maximun of 2^9 (=512) lines per code
           file. Since a code line represents 62 bytes of the original
           data, the maximum size of a file that can be encoded into a
           single 7PLUS code file is 512 * 62 = 31744 bytes.
           Bigger files are automatically encoded into several 7PLUS
           code files because of this restriction.

           However, 7PLUS already starts splitting at a size of 8557
           bytes, so that the 7PLUS code file have a size of abt 10K. By
           using the appropriate split options, 7PLUS can still be
           ordered to produce bigger files, if required.

             Note:
             -----
             The reason for the restriction of the size of code file to
             abt 10k lies in the not very smart method used in the store
             & forward traffic between BBSs.

             An example:

             A message of 40,000 bytes is to be transfered from BBS A to
             BBS B. If the transfer is interrupted by a link failure
             (happens quite frequently), the entire transfer has to be
             repeated from the top, until the link holds through the
             entire transfer.
             As long as the authors of bulletin board systems don't
             improve the store & forward method to allow resuming an
             interrupted transfer without starting allover, it is best
             to keep the size of files low.

           Single part code files are issued a filename consisting of
           the prefix of the filename of the original file and the
           extension '.7PL'.

           Example: 'FUNKTION.EXE' or 'FUNKTION.PAS' becomes
                    'FUNKTION.7PL'.

           Multipart code files are issued a different extension than
           single part code files. The extension '.PXX' marks all code
           files that belong together. 'XX' stands for a hexadecimal
           number in the range of 01 to FF (1 to 255 dec).

           Example: 'XMIT.EXE' may be encoded into 'XMIT.P01',
                    'XMIT.P02', 'XMIT.P03' etc.

           7PLUS can produce up to 255 parts. Thus, 255 * 31,744 =
           8,094,720 bytes can be encoded with 7PLUS.

           For Ham purposes, this is more than sufficient.

           Splitting
           =========

           7PLUS can split files in different manners.

           It can be ordered to

           - split into a specified number of files,

               where the size of the produced files depends on
               - the specified number of files and
               - the size of the original file,

           or

           - split into files of a specified size,

               where the number of files produced depends on
               -  the specified size of the parts and
               -  the size of the original file.

           How 7PLUS splits can be greatly influenced by the user.

           See discription of the split options in 'Usage/Ecoding'.


           The metafile
           ============

           A new feature of 7PLUS are the so-called metafiles. They
           eliminate a number of processing steps when correcting files.

           With older versions of 7PLUS, the user had to keep the unsuc-
           cessfully decoded files until he received a correction file.
           When the correction file was received, the code files had to
           be corrected and then decoded. Were there a good number of
           single byte errors, this could take a considerable amount of
           time and if the correction was not successful, the procedure
           had to be repeated. In principal, the code files were decoded
           three times: once when trying to decode, when correcting and
           again when finally decoding. This wasn't very effective, as
           anyone can imagine.

           Now, 7PLUS will produce a metafile, when first decoding. The
           metafile contains all successfully decoded lines (in their
           already decoded form) and where lines are missing or damaged,
           the metafile is filled in with NUL bytes.

           At this point, the 7PLUS code files may be erased, because
           they are not needed for correcting.

           After decoding, the metafile has the same length as the
           original file, only where lines are missing, it has gaps
           where the missing lines can be inserted, when a correction
           file is available.



                                                                                                                                              11

                                                      7PLUS file formats
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Some important index information is then appended to the end
           of the metafile (basically the same information as in the
           error report), so 7PLUS can look up, where there still are
           gaps in the metafile.

           When a correction file is available, the gaps are simply
           filled in. The metafile does not even have to be moved for
           this process, because this is done by direct positioning of
           the write pointer. The previously inserted NUL bytes are
           simply overwritten.

           Since the metafile does not have to be moved, the process of
           correcting is now extremely fast. You may get the feeling,
           nothing has happened!

           If all gaps in the metafile are filled in, it is renamed to
           the name of the original file, truncated to its correct
           length (to rid it of the additional info 7PLUS put at the end
           of it; that is also done without moving the file) and its
           original timestamp is restored.

           Metafiles have filenames that consist of the prefix of the
           original file's name plus the extension '.7MF'. Metafiles
           must be kept, because without them, correcting errors is not
           possible!

           Note:
           On operating systems that do not support the manipulation of
           filesizes, the index info is not appended to the metafile but
           written into an extra file with the extension '.7IX'. At
           least under MS_DOS, DR_DOS, OS/2 and TOS (Atari), manipula-
           tion of filesizes is possible, so no extra index file is
           produced.


           The error report
           ================

           When 7PLUS code files have been damaged in transfer, 7PLUS
           does not actually recognize the specific errors, but

           - it recognizes which lines are missing or damaged and
             threrefore have to be transfered again,
           - 'memorizes' the uncorrupted and decoded lines in the
             metafile and
           - produces an error report, where all necessary information
             is contained to allow the uploader of the damaged files the
             compilation of a correction file.

           Exception:
           If only one byte per line is falsified, superfluous or
           missing, 7PLUS will correct the error on the spot (so-called
           'single byte correction').





                                                                                                                                              12

                                                      7PLUS file formats
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Example of an error report:

            go_text. TEST.ERR
           7PLUS error report: TEST.TXT 113 /Test.TXT/ 34028
           01
           005 006 007 03D FFF
           02
           10C 10D 10E FFF
           [18398BE4]
           00
           CRC A17D
            stop_text.

           The error report from OM B is practically the request for a
           correction file from OM A to thus resend the damaged lines,
           so they can be added to OM B's metafile.


           The lines ' go_text.' and ' stop_text.' mark the beginning
           and end of the error report. These markings allow 7PLUS to
           find and extract the error report from a capture file.

           Note:

           The markings ' go_text.' and ' stop_text.' are also used by
           my program FFR (Mailbox File Fractionizer) to mark regular
           text for automatic extraction. Only when the extension of the
           filename stated in the ' go_text.' line is either '.ERR' or
           '.COR', it is an error report or a correction file! (Axel)


           The header '7PLUS error report...' contains information 7PLUS
           needs to compile a correction file:

           - Name of the original file,
           - number of lines per file (splitsize),
           - the full filename (only AMIGA/UNIX since v1.4) and
           - the length of the original file (since 7PLUS v1.5).


           The two-digit hex values define the part (01 - FF) in wich
           the following lines were corrupted.
           An unsplit 7PLUS file is handled as 'part 1' here.

           One or more lines containing 3-digit hex values follow (the
           first line in a code file is regarded as line 000 and the
           512th as 1FF).

           A line number of 'FFF' concludes the list of damaged lines
           for that part.

           This can be repeated for all parts having missing or damaged
           lines.

           Since 7PLUS v2.0 the error report is conluded by the original
           file's timestamp enclosed in braces '[]'. The old conclusion


                                                                                                                                              13

                                                      7PLUS file formats
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           '00' is still there for reasons of compatibility to older
           versions.

           After this, the checksum for the error report follows (since
           7PLUS v1.5) to enable 7PLUS to check the validity of the
           error report before using it.


           The correction file
           ===================

           Upon reception of the error report from OM B, OM A (hope-
           fully) compiles a correction file with it. The correction
           file contains all the lines that were requested by the error
           report. OM A then either sends the correction file to OM B or
           posts it as a bulletin, when he has been receiving the same
           error reports from more than one OM.
           In case the error reports differ, OM A can have 7PLUS join
           them ('-J' option) to one error report and then produce a
           collective correction file with it.

           When using a correction file, 7PLUS will only replace lines
           that aren't already decoded successfully. Because of this, OM
           B2 can use the correction file that was intended for OM B as
           well and without risk. The correction will then be success-
           ful, if all the lines that are demaged with OM B2 are
           successfully replaced.

           Example of a correction file:

            go_text. TEST.COR
           7PLUS correction: TEST.TXT 34028 113 [18398BE4]

                                                      7PLUS file formats
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           The header '7PLUS correction...' contains the following
           information:

           -  name of the original file,
           -  length of the original file (decimal) (since 7PLUS v1.5),

           and additionally since 7PLUS v2.0:
           -  the blocksize in lines (hex) the original file was split
              into and
           -  the timestamp of the original file.

           A line with an entry of the form ' PXX:' defines, for which
           of the encoded files the following lines are meant. The code
           lines are preceded by ' LXXX:' wich states the line number in
           the file. 'XX' and 'XXX' stand for two- and three-digit hex
           values.

           The structure of the error reports and correction files is
           intentionally held very simple.


           'Saving' damaged error reports and correction files
           ===================================================

           When an error report or correction file has been damaged and
           it has a checksum, 7PLUS will break execution and warn the
           user about the missing or incorrect checksum.
           This does not necessarily mean, the file is unusable. Since
           the structure of these files is help very simple, it should
           not be very difficult to erase the faulty parts.
           Since the checksum (CRC XXXX) is incorrect, it must also be
           erased or else 7PLUS will still refuse to use it.
           In addition the '-F' option must be issued, when using files
           manipulated in this manner.
           This way it is still possible to at least use the good parts
           of an error report or correction file, making the next try
           (requesting new correction file etc.) less voluminous.

           If the correction file was downloaded by our fictional OM B2,
           he may be lucky if the correction file contained more lines
           than he needed to do the correction. Then all his damaged
           lines may now be replaced (if the right lines were in the
           correction file, of course).


           Compatibility of 7PLUS versions
           ===============================

           7PLUS will decode all files produced with older versions of
           7PLUS. Files produced with 7PLUS v1.0 e.g. will still decode
           without any difficulty with 7PLUS v2.0.

           Since version 1.60 the single byte correction feature was
           added. For this the code lines were fitted with an additional
           checksum. Because of this change, versions of 7PLUS before
           v1.4 will not decode the files from version 1.60 and above


                                                                                                                                              15

                                                           Compatibility
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           any more! There is however the possibility of manually
           erasing the additional checksums from every line (the last
           two characters) and to then decode with a version prior to
           v1.4. Since the greater part of users has a newer version,
           this incompatibility is actually not a problem any more. Not
           many other encoders (if any) are as highly an up- AND down-
           ward compatible as 7PLUS is.

           Error reports and correction files are also up- and downward
           compatible.

           Since 7PLUS v1.5 the error reports and correction files are
           fitted with a global checksum. It is only checked for
           validity if the files actually contains a checksum. If 7PLUS
           does not find a checksum however, it will warn the user:

           'no CRC. File may be corrupted or from version earlier than
            7PLUS v1.5'.

           This only means, that 7PLUS could not figure out, if the file
           is ok or not. You should take a look at such files and read
           the chapter ''Saving' damaged ...'.


           Filename conventions
           ====================

           Filenames handled by 7PLUS, must comply with the rules
           concerning filename generation under MS_DOS, no matter what
           system 7PLUS is implemented on.

           They are always made up of
           - a name (8 characters max.) and
           - an extension (3 characters max.) seperated by a period.

           Filenames in 7PLUS-files are always in uppercase!

           Example for a filename according to above rules: TERMINAL.EXE

           On disk, lower case is used for the filenames, if the file-
           system allows this. This is very important on systems that do
           not ignore the case in filenames (UNIX).

           To enable transfer of full filenames on systems with name
           structures different than MS_DOS, the full filenames are
           transfered separately (see 'The header'). At the same time,
           an MS_DOS compatible filename is created to insure exchange-
           ability. E.g., the full filename 'Hyper_Term_Plus' would be
           changed into 'HYPER_TE'.

           When encoding a file without splitting it, the encoded file
           is assigned '.7PL' as the extention.  (TERMINAL.7PL)

           Split files are assigned '.PXX' as the extension, where XX is
           a hexadecimal number in the range 01 through FF.



                                                                                                                                              16

                                                    Filename conventions
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Error reports usually have '.ERR' and correction files '.COR'
           for an extension. This is very important, because 7PLUS gets
           its information on what to do from the extension!

           - '.ERR' tells the 7PLUS of the uploader to compile a
             correction file,
           - '.COR' tells the 7PLUS of the downloader to do the
             correction


           It is allowed to change names of error reports and correction
           files. However, the extensions MUST comply with above rules!

           If you recieved a lot of error reports, there is another way
           of naming these files. The first error report must have
           '.ERR' for an extension and the following ones must have
           '.EXX', where XX is a two-digit hex value.

           Example:
           You received three error reports that all relate to the same
           upload (TEST.7PL). When extracting through the '-X' option,
           the first report will be called TEST.ERR, the second TEST.E01
           and the third TEST.E02. The three reports can then easily be
           joined into a combined report using the '-J' option for
           instance.

           Analogous to the naming of error reports, correction files
           may also be numbered. If you receive several correction files
           that have the same name (and relate to the same upload),
           7PLUS will name the first correction file 'TEST.COR', the
           next 'TEST.C01' etc..


           7PLUS-files should always be stored with filenames
           corresponding to these rules. This is even more important in
           regard to split files and correcting, because 7PLUS may
           otherwise not be able to find the files belonging together!


           Usage
           =====

           The following examples apply to an MSDOS system. If using
           7PLUS on an Atari_ST, you don't need to enter '7plus' again
           in the requester after you double clicked 7PLUS, but only the
           parameters shown in the examples.
           On an Amiga, the CLI must first be started. The syntax is
           then the same as in the examples, except for differences in
           the structure of filename and paths.

           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Encoding
           --------

           7plus test.txt
               7PLUS will encode the file TEST.TXT and (if necessary)
               automatically split it into files of about 10K in size.

           7plus test.txt -s
               7PLUS will encode TEST.TXT and split it into files of
               maximum size (up to 512 lines per file).

           7plus test.txt -s 30
               Encode and split TEST.TXT into files of 30 lines each.

           7plus test.txt -sp 3
               Encode and split TEST.TXT into 3 files of about equal
               size.

           7plus test.txt -sb 5000
               Encode and split TEST.TXT into files of about 5000 bytes
               length.


           Extracting
           -----------
           (Extracting = copy 7PLUS files from a capture file)

           One can use an editor to extract 7PLUS files from a capture
           file, but 7PLUS can do this much quicker, safer and more
           convenient.

           The 7PLUS extractor looks for files in the capture file that
           - begin with the markings ' go_7+.', ' go_info.'
             or ' go_text.', and
           - end with the line containing ' stop_7+.', ' stop_info.'
             or ' stop_text.'.

           The full command to extract 7PLUS files from a capture file
           is:

           7plus <capturefile> -x [<searchtext>]


           Examples:

           7plus spsave.c10 -x 999.err
               7PLUS extracts (and numbers) all error reports from the
               capture file 'spsave.c10' if their name  contains
               '999.err'. This could be 'TERM999.ERR' or 'MEGA1999.ERR'
               etc.

           7plus a:term.log -x
               If no searchtext is issued, ALL 7PLUS files contained in
               a capture file are extracted. In this case, the files are
               extracted from 'a:term.log'.



                                                                                                                                              18

                                                                   Usage
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           7plus 91-05-15 -x ###
               When a fictional searchtext is issued (e.g. ###), no
               files are extracted, but a list is generated, showing
               what files are contained in the capture file. You get a
               sort of directory of the contents.

           When extracting, no matter if the line delimitors in the
           capture file are CR/LF, CR or LF, the extracted files will
           have line delimitors in compliance with the system used:
           CR/LF on IBM and Atari_ST and LF on Amiga and UNIX.

           If the capture file was created by capturing the data in
           binary mode, the line delimitors in the file will only be
           CRs, wich will make editing impossible. 7PLUS however is not
           only able to correctly extract, but also the correct naming
           of the files is insured.
           Along with the 7PLUS code files, error reports, correction
           files  and info files are also extracted. Info files have to
           be marked manually before uploading them to a BBS by
           inserting ' go_info. FILENAME.EXT' as the first line and
           ' stop_info.' as the last line. FILENAME.EXT is the filename,
           the info file will be given, when extracted.

           At this point, I would like to bring your attention to the
           existance of another program of mine, that will also do the
           job of extracting 7PLUS files and more: FFR (Mailbox File
           Fractionizer).
           The FFR will also extract bulletins, personal mail and the
           files of most other encoders (RADIX95, CODEX, 7BIT etc.).
           The FFR can be freely configured to work with many bulletin
           board systems. Currently it knows the formats of TheBox,
           F6FBB, W0RLI, MSYS and many more.. It's almost as popular
           as 7PLUS around Germany.. (Axel)


           Decoding
           ------

           7plus test.7pl
               7PLUS decodes TEST.7PL. If there are no errors in
               TEST.7PL, 7PLUS will produce a copy of the original file
               using the MSDOS compatible filename (unless decoding on
               an Amiga or UNIX system. Then the full filename is used,
               if available). In case of errors, 7PLUS will produce an
               error report (TEST.ERR).
               If 7PLUS finds a correction file 'TEST.COR' in the same
               directory, it will use it automatically. If additional
               correction files exist (TEST.C01, TEST.C02 etc.) they are
               also used.
               See also 'The metafile'.

           7plus test.p01
               7PLUS will decode all parts (*.p01, *.p02 etc.).
               See previous example.




                                                                                                                                              19

                                                                   Usage
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           7plus test
               7PLUS will -  either DECODE 'TEST.7PL' or 'TEST.PXX'
                          -  or ENCODE the file named 'TEST'.


           Compiling a correction file
           ---------------------------

           7plus test.err c:\pr\
               7PLUS will compile the correction file 'TEST.COR'. It
               will look for the original file 'TEST.TXT' in the
               directory 'C:\PR\'. If no searchpath is issued, 7PLUS
               will look for 'TEST.TXT in the current directory. It is
               not necessary for the uploader of 'TEST.TXT' to keep the
               encoded files (TEST.7PL or TEST.PXX), because they are
               not needed to compile a correction file. The only thing,
               he MUST keep is the original unencoded file 'TEST.TXT'!
               Without it, no correction files can be compiled. Also he
               should remember how he split 'TEST.TXT' to be able to
               supply entire parts, if they have been lost alltogether.

           7PLUS automatically splits very large correction files into
           chunks of about 10k. The size, where 7PLUS begins to split
           can be influenced with the '-SB' option.
           See 'Encoding'


           A special situation can arise, when a 7PLUS file was created
           on a system with non-MSDOS filename structures.

           Example:

           An OM, who has an AMIGA, encodes 'Hyper_Term_Plus'. 7PLUS
           creates an MSDOS compatible filename from the full filename:
           'HYPER_TE' (the full filename is also transfered in the 7PLUS
           files, but is not used on MSDOS or Atari_ST systems).
           The 'AMIGA-OM' uploads the file(s) and an 'MSDOS-OM' down-
           loads it/them and decodes with a version of 7PLUS older than
           v1.4. In case of errors, the 'MSDOS-OM' sends his error
           report to the 'AMIGA-OM'. He tries to compile the correction
           file, but his 7PLUS looks for 'HYPER_TE' instead of
           'Hyper_Term_Plus'! In this case, the full name including the
           path must be specified:

           E.g.: 7plus hyper_te.err df0:utils/Hyper_Term_Plus

           This problem will not arise, if the 'MSDOS-OM' used 7PLUS
           v1.4 (or higher), because 7PLUS will add the full filename to
           the error report.









                                                                                                                                              20

                                                                   Usage
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Correcting
           ----------

           7plus test.cor
               7PLUS will use the correction file 'TEST.COR' to fill the
               gaps in the metafile 'TEST.7MF'. If not all gaps could be
               filled, 7PLUS creates a new error report. This is the
               case if the correction file does not cover all gaps or
               not the right ones. Send the new error report to the
               uploader and request a new correction file. If 7PLUS
               finds additional correction files (TEST.C01, TEST.C02
               etc.) in the same directory as 'TEST.COR' it will
               automatically use them.

           7plus test.p03 -c
               7PLUS also allows the usage of a regular 7PLUS file as a
               correction file. It will take the lines it needs out of
               'TEST.P03' and fill the gaps in the metafile. If gaps
               remain, 7PLUS will create a new error report, just as
               stated in the previous example.

           If the correction file was produced using a 7PLUS version
           prior to v1.5, 7PLUS will break execution, because it can't
           find any checksum. 7PLUS can be forced to use such a file by
           issuing the '-F' option. You should however take a look at
           the file, before doing so!
           See also ''Saving' damaged...'

           Tip for insiders:

           If 'TEST.7PL/PXX' was uploaded to a general board and correc-
           tion files for it turn up from time to time, one could well
           wait until a fitting correction file turns up.

           You may use as many correction files as you wish. Since all
           successfully decoded lines are stored in the metafile, you
           may be lucky to eventually fill all remaining gaps.


           Joining error reports
           ---------------------

           Joining of error report is usefull, when an uploader has
           received more than one error report. He can use the joined
           error report to produce a collective correction file which
           contains all lines that were reported damaged. If all error
           reports are the same, joining is not necessary, of course.


           7plus test.err test2.err -j
               7PLUS will join the error reports 'TEST.ERR' and
               'TEST2.ERR'.






                                                                                                                                              21

                                                                   Usage
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           7plus test.err -j
               7PLUS will automatically join all error reports that were
               created through extraction with the '-X' option. 7PLUS
               looks for 'TEST.E01', 'TEST.E02' etc.


           Recreating an error report from a metafile
           ------------------------------------------

           In case an error report is lost or if you want to send one
           again (because the first one wasn't answered), it can be
           recreated from the metafile.

           7plus test.7mf
               7PLUS reads the index information from the end of the
               metafile and uses it to create 'TEST.ERR'.

           NOTE:
           On some systems, 'TEST.7IX' must be specified instead of
           'TEST.7MF'. The reason for this is explained in the chapter:
           'The metafile'.


           Quick help
           ----------

           7PLUS -H (or simply 7PLUS)
               A short usage info is displayed. The info is longer than
               25 lines, so you should have your fingers on CTRL-S to
               pause the output.


           Additional options
           ------------------

               -K  With this option, 7PLUS will automatically clean up
               behind itself and erase all files, that aren't needed any
               more. Exception: When compiling correction files, error
               reports will not be erased, because they may still be
               needed for producing collective correction files.

           -N  (only ATARI_ST version)
               Usually 7PLUS prompts for a key stroke after termination.
               The '-N' option will switch off this prompt. This is
               useful when 7PLUS is invoked by another program (shell).

           -P  Encoded files, error repors and correction files will be
               written with CR as line delimitor. This is necessary with
               those terminal programs, where 7PLUS-files must be sent
               in binary mode, because they can't handle 8 bit
               characters in textmode. This is even more important on
               the AMIGA or under UNIX , because the standard line
               separator there is LF! Uploading a file in binary mode,
               that has LF as a line delimitor, would create an unusable
               file on the receiving side, because LFs are always
               stripped in Packet Radio. The standard line separator in


                                                                                                                                              22

                                                                   Usage
           -------------------------------------------------------------

               Packet Radio is CR! The result would be a file that
               contains one extremely long line!

           -R  In case only one part of a multipart upload needs to be
               re-encoded (e.g. because it never reached it's destina-
               tion), it is not necessary to encode the entire original
               file. 7PLUS is able to re-encode only one specified part.

               Examplel: 7plus test.txt -sp 10 -r 5

               In this example, 7PLUS only encodes part 5, but not the
               parts 1-4 and 6-10.

               It is VERY IMPORTANT to re-encode in EXACTLY the SAME WAY
               as with the original upload. Be sure to use the same
               splitting options!

           -T  This option can be used to append a file termination
               string to 7PLUS files, error reports and correction files
               to automatically signal the end of the file when
               uploading.

               Example: 7plus test.txt -t /ex

               Note: If the terminating string begins with a minus sign
               '-', the entire string must be put into double quotes
               ("-EX") because 7PLUS would otherwise try to interpret it
               as an option.

           -TB format.dat
               When encoding, the head and foot texts contained in
               'FORMAT.DAT' are automatically added to the 7PLUS files.

               Example for 'FORMAT.DAT':

               The variables have the following meaning:

               %n  -> Name of the encoded file.
               %N  -> dito, in capital letters.
               %o  -> Name of unencoded original file.
               %O  -> dito, in capital letters.

               The '-TB' option only works when encoding, but not when
               creating correction files or error reports.

               Up to 256 character may be specified with '@@top' and
               '@@bottom'.

               A word of warning:

               Files created with this option should not be used with
               TheBox systems. There is a bug in the command parser of
               TheBox wich causes problems, when uploading 7PLUS files
               in one go (send command and 7PLUS file together in one
               file). If you get the error message 'invalid command',
               you know the bug has struk again. The bug always mani-
               fests when the first frame sent to the BBS contains
               semicolons!

               You should erase the file in the bbs then and upload it
               again by issueing the send command manually step by step.

               This bug in the command parser is present in ALL versions
               of TheBox, even in the test releases of the new TheBox
               v1.9. If it will be eliminated in the official release of
               the v1.9, remains to be seen.

               The '-TB' option will work fine with any other bulletin
               board system!

           -Y  7PLUS assumes 'YES' on all queries. This option is
               useful, when 7PLUS is invoked from another program
               (shell, server).

           -#  When using 7PLUS with a file server, the problem is to
               let the server know, how many files were produced when
               encoding. The server could pre-calculate, how many parts
               would be created, but 7PLUS can produce a small info file
               called 7PLUS.FLS containing the information on how many
               files were created and how the names of the encoded files
               are. The content of 7PLUS.FLS could e.g. be '10 TEST'.


           Tips for configuring devices and programs for 7PLUS
           ===================================================

           General conditions
           ------------------

           To be able to process 7PLUS files, it is important, that the
           TNC and the terminal program are configured correctly.

           With TNC2 (using TAPR firmware), KAM, PK232, PK88, MFJ ect.
           the following commands must be set to not interfere with 8
           bit characters:

                          8BITCONV ON, AWLEN 8 and LCOK ON
                       - or equivalent commands accordingly -


           The serial link between the computer and the terminal should
           be set to 8 bits, 1 stopbit, no parity (8n1).

           It is advisable to set the streamswitch character to $01
           (CTRL-A) - on a KAM, the second streamswitch should be set to
           $02 (CTRL-A) - because 7PLUS uses practically all displayable
           characters for itself.

           With streamswitch set to $7C (|) e.g.,

           - you may experience unwanted stream changes when uploading
             7PLUS files!

           - the terminal program may detect wrong streamswitches when
             downloading 7PLUS files and thus induce unexpected actions.

           With the streamswitch set to $01, it is not necessary to use
           the transparent mode to upload 7PLUS files!

           All commercial TNCs and multimode controllers are able to
           handle 8 bit characters in non-transparent mode!

           Character translation tables of terminal programs must be set
           to 1:1 translation (no translation). Some programs have
           options to strip or permanently set the MSB (most significant
           bit). These options must be set, so the MSB is not stripped
           and not changed in any way!




                                                                                                                                              25

                                        Configuring devices and programs
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Terminal emulations (VT100, ANSI etc.) should not pose any
           problems with 7PLUS files, because the control sequences used
           in those emulation usually begin with an escape charater (the
           7PLUS code does not use the escape character!). Should there
           be problems with the emulation inspite of that, try switching
           to a simple TTY-emulation.

           If you are still having problems with 7PLUS files, the
           problem lies with the terminal program. In that case, you
           should read the chapter 'Downloading/uploading in binary
           mode'. If that doesn't solve the problems, try to get in
           contact with the author of the terminal program. In his own
           interest, he will see to it to bring his program up to date
           (this probably won't work with commercial products).

           Generally, terminal programs made for telefone use shouldn't
           be used for Packet Radio.

           There are a lot of very sophisticated programs especially
           made for Packet Radio use. Most of them are free or quite
           inexpensive. Sometimes the vendors of TNCs supply such
           programs along with the TNC.

           Since the first appearance of 7PLUS, updates have become
           available for all Packet Radio programs which are now '7plus
           safe'.

           Inspite all critics, this didn't take long at all, hi (Axel)


           Downloading/uploading in binary mode
           ====================================

           With some older Packet Radio terminal programs there may be
           problems with correct downloading or uploading of 7PLUS
           files. In such cases, the binary mode of those programs must
           be used. Don't get this mixed up with modem protocols like
           YAPP, X-, Y, Z-moden etc. Binary mode just describes a mode,
           where receiving and sending of data can be done without
           interpretation of the data content and without the use of a
           special protocol.


           Downloading
           -----------

           When downloading data in binary mode everything received is
           stored EXACTLY as it is. Since the line delimitor used in
           Packet Radio is the carriage return (CR), the downloaded
           files will only contain CRs as line delimitors.

           When using the usual capture features of the terminal
           programs, the conversion of the CR into (CR/LF or LF,
           dedending on what computer is used) is automatically done by
           the terminal program.



                                                                                                                                              26

                                        Configuring devices and programs
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Since the file produced in binary mode has not undergone the
           conversion, you won't be able to use a regular editor to cut
           the 7PLUS files out.

           To be able to extract the files anyway, use the '-X' option
           of 7PLUS. See 'Usage/Extracing'.

           Another way is to use a conversion program for line
           delimitors (e.g. CRLF. Available on request). The files that
           were converted can then be edited with a regular text editor.

           Downloading in binary mode has a useful side-effect:

           National (umlauts) and graphical characters can be downloaded
           even if the terminal program would normally strip them.


           Uploading
           ---------

           When uploading 7PLUS files, the '-P' option MUST be used.
           7PLUS will then use CRs as line delimitors.

           Error reports don't need to be uploaded in binary mode, so
           the '-P' oprion is not necessary there.


           7PLUS on the AMIGA
           ------------------

           Most terminal programs available for the AMIGA are not able
           to handle 8 bit characters, unfortunately (there are some
           commendable exceptions, however).
           In case of difficulties, use the binary mode of those
           terminal programs.

           Tips for down- and uploading of 7PLUS files
           ===========================================

           A lot of things can go wrong when down- or uploading 7PLUS
           files. To avoid unnecessary trouble, here a some useful
           hints.


           Downloading
           -----------

           Before downloading huge files from the BBS, you must make
           sure your terminal program and tnc are correctly configured.
           For this purpose you find ASC.TXT in the distribution archive
           of 7PLUS. Upload it to the BBS addressed to yourself and
           download it again. If it doesn't look EXACTLY like the



                                                                                                                                              27

                             Tips for down- and uploading of 7PLUS files
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           original any more, check your configuration and read the
           chapter 'Tips for configuring...'.

           If the test went ok, then you're set to download 7PLUS-files.

           The simplest way to download 7PLUS-files is to open a
           capturefile and continuously write the received files into
           it. Note that you should not call the capturefile the same as
           the 7PLUS-files you download! Use a name like 'savefile' for
           instance.

           When you have finished downloading the files (did you think
           of looking for correction files that may already be in the
           BBS?), you must extract them from the capturefile. For this,
           an editor can be used or - much more convenient - 7PLUS
           itself! 7PLUS will not only find and extract the files from
           the capturefile, but also create the correct filenames for
           them.

           Invoking 7PLUS like this:

              '7plus savefile -x'

           will do the job of extracting the files from the capturefile.

           Now, the files are in the format that 7PLUS needs and you can
           begin decoding.

            Let's see, what we have on disk now: (This is only an
           example)

              TERM999.INF
              TERM999.P01
              TERM999.P02
              TERM999.P03
              TERM999.P04
              TERM999.COR
              TERM999.C01

           Ah, fine... You thought of downloading the correction files
           that was already in the BBS.

           The file 'TERM999.INF' was automatically extracted by 7PLUS,
           because the author had uploaded it with the markings
           ' go_info. TERM999.INF' and ' stop_info.'. That way, you get
           the info file along with the 7PLUS files. Practical...

           Decoding (including correction) is very simple to do now:

              '7plus term999'

           In case a file called 'TERM999' (without an extension)
           already exists in the current directory, 7PLUS will try to
           encode 'TERM999' rather then decode 'TERM999.P01'!




                                                                                                                                              28

                             Tips for down- and uploading of 7PLUS files
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           This is why i pointed out, that you should use a name for the
           capturefile, that has no relation to the name of the 7PLUS-
           files.

           If you run into this problem, call 7PLUS this way:

              '7plus term999.p01'

           If decoding went ok, 7PLUS will tell you:

              'Decoding succesful! 'term999.exe' 43210 Bytes.'

           TERM999.EXE is the decoded file. What you have to do from
           now, depends entirely on the hints from its originator. As
           the author of 7PLUS, i don't have anything to do with it
           anymore from this point on.

           Let's suppose decoding did not go allright.

           7PLUS says:

              'Decoding not successful.'

           This just means, that you should take 'term999.err' and send
           it to the originator of 'term999.exe' and wait for the
           correction file to return from him.

           The meta file 'TERM999.7MF' must be kept at all cost! Without
           it, you won't be able to do the correction when you receive
           the correction file.

           The 7PLUS files 'TERM999.P01' etc are not needed any more and
           can be deleted.

           In the past, it happened that OMs sent me error reports for
           programs I have never uploaded and requested the according
           correction files from me! Let me say this again in full
           clarity: The one who uploaded the files, that were corrupted
           in Store & Forward, is the one you have to send the error
           reports to!!! I, as the author of the encoder used, have
           nothing to do with it. Comparison: A forwarding agency
           delivers goods that were damaged on the transport. No-one in
           his right mind would have the idea to hold the builder of the
           truck used for the transport (Me) liable, when the truck
           (7PLUS) is ok, but the roads (the network) are not....


           Automatic 'BBS milking'
           ------------------------

           Some terminal programs have features that allow to

                             Tips for down- and uploading of 7PLUS files
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           When using such features, this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:

           It happens quite frequently that files downloaded are
           incomplete because a link failure occured.

           You should in any case check, if all files really are
           complete. When decoding such incomplete files, much to big
           error reports are produced! You should take a look into the
           BBS, if the files really are damaged that much. If you send
           such a mammoth error report to the uploader, well knowing,
           most errors are due to link failures, you are stressing his
           good will. If this happens frequently, he could cease sending
           correction files at all!


           'Listening in' on someone else
           ----------------------------

           Some terminal programs have features that allow capturing
           everything another station is downloading from a BBS. This is
           a practical way to keep the load on the BBS/digipeater down.

           7PLUS files that were captured that way, ussually contain
           more errors than are really present in the BBS. This is due
           to the fact, that not every frame sent to the other station
           you were 'listening' to, was captured.

           However, doubled frames are no problem for 7PLUS. You don't
           need to edit them out.

           When decoding such a file, you should be aware that it is a
           VERY NASTY thing to do to send the error report to the
           original uploader!

           Firstly, this causes him unnecessary work and secondly in
           case he uses the error reports to create a collective
           correction file, it will contain a lot of lines that are not
           corrupted anywhere!

           Better is, to either

           - send the error report to the station you were listening in
             to, and explain why you are doing so. He will most probably
             be happy to help out. If he was able to decode the files
             successfully, he can compile a correction file right away.
             If not, you'll have to wait until he got his own correction
             file,

           or

           - listen in to other OMs, who are downloading the files you
             need and use the files to correct the metafile. If errors
             remain, continue as described above.

                             Tips for down- and uploading of 7PLUS files
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           Uploading
           ---------

           As in the previous chapter, make sure your terminal and tnc
           are configured correctly to handle 7PLUS-files. If you don't
           take all precautions, the files may not be decodable. So,
           avoid frustrating the other users an think before acting.

           You should write a small info in which you explain,
           - what program is contained in the files you upload,
           - what system the program is for,
           - what hardware is required,
           - what compressor (ARJ, LHARC, LHA, PKZIP) was used,
           - what files are in the archive and last but not least
           - what encoder was used for the upload (7PLUS in this case).

           This way one can see right away, if the program is any use
           for him.

           The title of this info should be brief but yet state all
           needed info, e.g.:

           'TERM999.EXE Info'

           When uploading to a general purpose board (ALL, SOFTWA etc.),
           you should also state the system the program runs on:

           'TERM999.EXE Info (IBM)'

           The info text should be marked, so 7PLUS can extract it along
           with the 7PLUS files:

            go_info. TERM999.INF
           This is where the info is put.....
            stop_info.

           The filename with ' go_info. ...' should be spelled in
           capital letters and comply with the rules for MSDOS/
           Atari_TOS! See 'Filename conventions'.


           OK, now you can do the encoding.

           Bear in mind that some BBSs restrict the size of bulletins.
           Ask your SYSOP about this. Take this into regard when
           splitting the file up ('-s','-sp' or '-sb' option).

           By using the '-SB' option, you can directly specify the size
           of the encoded 7PLUS files or correction files.

           Invoking 7PLUS like this:

              '7plus term999.exe -sb 4000'

           tells it to produce files of roughly 4000 bytes each.



                                                                                                                                              31

                             Tips for down- and uploading of 7PLUS files
           -------------------------------------------------------------

           When not specifying a split option, 7PLUS will produce files
           of about 10000 bytes in length.


           After encoding is done, you should have the files TERM999.P01
           through TERM999.P?? (lets suppose, 12 files were produced) on
           disk. The files can now be uploaded seperately. Here also,
           you should choose an informative title:

           'TERM999.P01 / 0C 7+

           Means: TERM952 is encoded with 7PLUS and it's the first file
           of 12 (0C hex) parts.

           Even better, but maybe somewhat cryptic to newcomers:

           'TERM999.EXE.SFX.P01/0C.7+'

           The best way to read this, is from the rear:

           1) It's a 7PLUS-file,
           2) of a 12 part upload,
           3) the first part,
           4) and the resulting program is a self extracting archive
              called TERM999.EXE.

           After uploading all the files, you should check them by down-
           loading them right away. They could have become corrupted on
           the way from your terminal to the BBS! In case they really
           were corrupted, generate a correction file and upload it. It
           is not really necessary to upload the entire file that was
           corrupted.


           And now: wait for error reports...

           See also 'Additional options / -TB'


           Uploading correction files
           --------------------------

           It has proven to be a good idea to upload correction files
           twice (in one file).

           It is very unprobable that both copies of the correction file
           get corrupted. In case it does happen, the recipient still
           has the option to use an editor to put togheter one good file
           from the two corrupted ones.

           -------------------------------------------------------------

           General notes
           =============

           When downloading 7PLUS files from a BBS, always look for
           correction files the uploader may have already posted. There
           is a good chance that the correction file covers the errors.
           This saves the uploader unecessary work.

           If you have uploaded 7PLUS files, answering error reports is
           a question of good manners and Ham Spirit! Files no-one can
           get a correction file to, are just garbage, clogging up the
           BBSs. Of course, there is always the chance, that all files
           came through undamaged. Unfortunately, that isn't very often
           the case.


           Is there a future without errors?
           =================================

           Should there be one fine day where the Packet Radio network
           does not produce any more errors, that must not really mean
           the end of 7PLUS.

           It should be considered, that

           - some BBSs have a throughput of several billion characters,

           - a message passes maybe several 100 memory cells and
             harddisks during its travel from A to B,

           - some computers don't use memory parity checking, so memory
             defects may go undetected for some time,

           - the AX25 protocol only has a limited amount of safety
             against bit errors,

           - an affordable network still has a lot of unprotocolled
             links (TNC<-->computer, TNC<-->TNC in some nodes) and last,
             but not least

           - a simple impulse can cause the alteration of a character!

           7PLUS can insure that a file is reconstituted exactly as it
           was, even if it passed through a lot of BBS.


           7PLUS is available for a wide range of systems by now, so it
           represents a safe and practical way of transfering binary
           data between different systems
           And it's more compact than the old-style encoders like UUE or
           RADIX95...

           Ordering 7PLUS
           ==============

           7PLUS can be ordered by disk.

           Send a 3 inch disk plus SASE and maybe a small contribution
           to my address (see cover of this manual).

           When ordering from outside of germany, enclose 3 US-Dollars
           for the return postage.

           Specify, for what system you need 7PLUS! I can supply version
           for IBM clones, Atari_ST and AMIGA.


           Important for the AMIGA:

           I am not able to read or write disks formatted on the AMIGA.
           I will supply 7PLUS in MSDOS format, so you need to have a
           tool wich allows reading of MSDOS disks like e.g. DOS_2_DOS.
