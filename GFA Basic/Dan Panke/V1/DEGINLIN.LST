'  Place the cursor on the INLINE line above, then hit

'  top of the screen.  Press [L] for Load, then use
'  the file selector to choose your DEGAS picture.
'  The pic is imbedded into your code.  pic_add% will now
'  hold the start address of the picture.  (32066 is the
'  length of a DEGAS file.)  You can have as many pics as
'  you want, each in it's own INLINE statement, with different
'  start-address variable names.  Pass the start address to
'  the procedure below to view the picture.
'
'  An example:
deg_view(pic_add%)  !  pic_add% is the start address of the pic stored
'                      in the INLINE statement above.
