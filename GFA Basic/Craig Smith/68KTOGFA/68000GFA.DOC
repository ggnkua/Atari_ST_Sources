                         Conversion Utility

                           Introduction...
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
  To follow up on ST Format's GFA Basic Tutorial Series I decided
  to make a fast and powerful utility for converting Machine Code
  Routines to Basic Equivalent.  For example let's say you want to
  add the 'BASCODE.EXE' Routine (Supplied with Most Samplers) to 
  your GFA Basic Masterpiece, you could use this utility to do that.
  You could even write animation routines in Assembler and converge
  them with your Basic to improve your program.  For those who 
  do not know 68000 Machine Code, then get Stuck In with Peter
  Molyneux's Assembler series in ST Format.  Note that you will
  also need an Assembler Package to get the best out of this utility.
  Luckily enough ST Format is giving away Devpac ST On the Coverdisk,
  so there is no reason why you can't write a scorcher of a game
  becuase you have all the Utilities for the Purpose and one of
  Britain's top Programmers teaching you all you need to know!!!
      
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
                        Files On Disk...
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  You should have the following files with this utility:

  68000GFA.PRG     -     The Conversion Program itself.
  ROUTINE.S        -     An example assembler file which inverts.
                         the screen when called.
  68000GFA.DOC     -     This text you are reading!
  EXAMPLE.BAS      -     An example GFA Basic File to 'Poke' and
                         call the source above.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
                        Using the Program...
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Using this Program could not be easier!  Simply Load it from 
  desktop and when the Program has loaded simply follow onscreen
  prompts.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
                         Beginners Guide...
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  For those totally lost and that don't know how to start follow
  these steps and you should be okay:

  1.  Assemble The Example Source File Given with this Program
      using DEVPAC.

  2.  Load in the Converter Program.

  3.  When asked for a source file, insert your disk containing
      the assembled file and select the file.

  4.  The screen will flash yellow and red whilst the Conversion
      Process is taking Place.

  5.  When the Conversion has taken place, you will be asked
      for an output filename.  The extension must be LST so that
      GFA-BASIC can Merge it.

  6.  Save the Output file and load up GFA-BASIC.

  7.  Load EXAMPLE.BAS by Pressing F1.

  8.  Move Cursor to end of EXAMPLE.BAS and insert the disk 
      containing the file created above.

  9.  Press F2 to Merge, then wait.

  10. After it has merged you should see DATA Statements appear.

  11. Run The Program and thats all there is to it!

                     Hints on Writing Routines
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Programmer must pay attention to the following points when
  using machine routines in GFA-BASIC:

  1.  End your routine with RTS to hand control back to GFA-BASIC.
  2.  Make sure your routines are position independant and if they
      are not Position indepedant that they are poked to the 
      proper start address.
  3.  GFA-BASIC puts the routines in user mode when it calls them,
      so you must ensure that they put themselfs in SUPERVISOR
      mode if they need to.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Finally I hope that Programmers, find this useful as a supplement
 to ST Format's GFA-BASIC Tutorials and Assembler Tutorials.  Finally
 who know's maybe you could write a format Gold or a decent animation
 demo and even if you don't, this Utility will provide you with an
 handy tool for Future use.  Have Fun...
