                         STONE-AGE DELUXE

     This is an enhanced version of STONE-AGE which adds many new 
features, including:

     * Ability to Create, Save, and Load additional Screens

     * Two Player games are supported

     * Practice and Play mode... Play mode incorporates a timer
        as well as scoring

     * Ability to start at any of 5 levels

     * Three skill levels... Easy, Tougher, and Hard

     * Willi now moves faster... hold the Joystick Button down
        to slow him down!
     
     * Instructions and Help files are built-in... just press
        HELP KEY at Create Screen or Play Screen

There are a few other neat features that I'll let you discover for 
yourself!  Hope you have fun with it.  Create your own worlds for 
Willi to conquer, then upload them so others can share (each World 
should have 5 levels... two worlds are included in this file).  
Let me know of any enhancements you would like to see!
