
Instructions for GRMODE.EXE

This file is fairly straight forward. The file need only be run once to set
up your graphics mode.
Grmode also sets up color and whether you have a printer on-line. Grmode now
allows the user to set up the limit for the wheeling system found in option
'C' from the main menu. You can choose between 14 and 49 numbers for the 
wheeling system.
