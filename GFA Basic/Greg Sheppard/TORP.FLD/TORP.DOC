  TORP! must be about the 3 millionth computer battle-ship game; yet I
offer it up as my first attempt at a GFA Basic game.  Perhaps some of
the techniques employed may be interesting or useful.
  Play is simple:
  First, select positions for your ships using the mouse and left
button.  Meanwhile, the computer selects positions for its ships.
  Play resumes with the computer leading off.  There are ten turns, five
shots per turn and one free shot turn.
  Player with most points at the end wins.
