Developer information

The Atari STE¿ family of computers is equipped to reproduce digitized sound 
using DMA (direct memory access; that is, without using the 68000).  
This document provides the information required to understand and use this 
feature.

OVERVIEW

Sound is stored in memory as digitized samples.  Each sample is a number, 
from -128 to +127, which represents displacement of the speaker from the 
"neutral" or middle position.  During horizontal blanking (transparent 
to the processor) the DMA sound 
chip fetches samples from memory and provides them to a digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC) at one of several constant rates, programmable as 
(approximately) 50KHz (kilohertz), 25KHz, 12.5KHz, and 6.25KHz.  
This rate is called the sample frequency.

The output of the DAC is then filtered to a frequency equal to 40% of the 
sample frequency by a four-pole switched low-pass filter.  
This performs "anti-aliasing" of the sound data in a 
sample-frequency-sensitive way.  The signal is further filtered 
y a two-pole fixed frequency (16kHz) low-pass filter and provided to a 
National LMC1992 Volume/Tone Controller.  Finally, the output is available 
at an RCA-style output jack on the back of the computer.  This can be fed 
into an amplifier, and then to
speakers, headphones, or tape recorders. 

There are two channels which behave as described above; they are intended 
to be used as the left and right channels of a stereo system when using 
the audio outputs of the machine.  A monophonic mode is provided which 
will send the same sample data to
each channel.

The stereo sound output is also mixed onto the standard ST audio output 
sent to the monitor's speaker.  The ST's GI sound chip output can be mixed 
to the monitor and to both stereo output jacks as well.

DATA FORMAT

Each sample is stored as a signed eight-bit quantity, where -128 (80 hex) 
means full negative displacement of the speaker, and 127 (7F hex) means 
full positive displacement.  In stereo mode, each word represents two 
samples: the upper byte is the sam
le for the left channel, and the lower byte is the sample for the right 
channel.  In  mono mode each byte is one sample.  However, the samples 
are always fetched a word at a time, so only an even number of mono 
samples can be played.

A group of samples is called a "frame."  A frame may be played once or can 
automatically be repeated forever (until stopped).  A frame is described by 
its start and end addresses.  The end address of a frame is actually the 
address of the first byte 
in memory beyond  the frame; a frame starting at address 21100 which is 
10 bytes long has an end address of 21110.

time to stop playback immediately.

The frame address registers occupy the low bytes of three consecutive words 
each.  The high bytes of these words do not contain anything useful, 
and it is harmless to read or write them.  The frame address counter 
register is read-only, and holds the
address of the next sample word to be fetched.

PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS

The simplest way to produce a sound is to assemble a frame in memory, 
write the start address of the frame into the Frame Start Address register, 
and the end address of the frame into the Frame End Address register, 
set the Mode register appropriatel
 (set stereo or mono, and the sample frequency), and write a one into the 
Sound DMA Control register.  The frame will play once, then stop.

To produce continuous sound, and link frames together, more elaborate 
techniques are required.

The DMA sound chip produces a signal called "DMA sound active" which is 
one when the chip is playing sounds, and zero when it's not. When a frame 
ends in the repeat mode (mode 3), there is a transition from "active" to 
"idle" and back again on this s
gnal.  The signal is presented as the external input to MFP Timer A.  
You can put Timer A into Event Count mode and use it to generate an 
interrupt, for example when a frame has played a given number of times.  
Because of the design of the MFP, the a
tive edge for this signal must be the same as the input on GPIP I4, which 
is the interrupt line from the keyboard and MIDI interfaces.  
It is, and the Active Edge Register is already programmed for that, 
so you need not worry about that if you use   
timer A to count frames.

The DMA Sound chip's mode 3 (repeat mode) ensures seamless linkage of 
frames, because the start and end registers are actually double-buffered.  
When you write to these registers, what you write really goes into a 
"holding area".  The contents of the
holding area go into the true registers at the end of the current frame.  
(Actually, they go in when the chip is idle, which means right away if the 
chip was idle to begin with.)

If you have two frames which you want played in succession, you can write 
the start and end addresses of the first frame into the chip, then set 
its control register to 3.  The first frame will begin playing.  
You can then immediately write the start
and end addresses of the second frame into the chip: they will be held in 
the holding area until the first frame finishes, then they'll be copied 
into the true registers and the second frame will play.  The interrupt 
between frames will still happen,
so you can tell when the first frame has finished. Then, for instance, you 
can write the start and end registers for the start of a third frame, 
knowing that it will begin as soon as the second frame has finished.  
You could even write new data into 
he first frame and write its start and end address into the chip; this 
kind of ping-pong effect is rather like double-buffering of a graphics 
display.

Here is an example of using Timer A in Event Count mode to play a 
controlled series of frames.  Suppose you have three frames, A, B, and C, 
and you want to play frame A three times, then frame B five times, and 
finally frame C twice.  The sequence of
steps below will accomplish this.  Numbered steps are carried out by your 
program; the bracketed descriptions are of things which are happening 
as a result.

1.	Set Timer A to event count mode, and its counter to 2 (not 3).

2.	Write Frame A's start & end addresses into the registers.

3.	Write a 3 to the sound DMA control register. [Play begins.] 
Go do something else until interrupted.

[At the end of the second repetition of Frame A, the timer's interrupt 
fires. At the same time, frame A begins its third repetition.]

4.	Write Frame B's start and end addresses into the DMA sound chip.  
These values will be held until the third repetition of Frame A finishes.

5.	Set Timer A's count register to 5, then go away until interrupted

[When the current repetition finishes, the start & end registers are loaded 
from the holding area, and Frame B will begin playing.  The end-of-frame 
signal will cause Timer A to count from 5 to 4.  At the end of Frame B's 
fourth repetition, its fifth
will start, the timer will count down from 1 to 0, and the interrupt will 
occur.]

6.	Write frame C's start & end addresses into the registers, and 
program Timer A to count to 2.  Go away until interrupted.

(When the current repetition (B's fifth) finishes, the start & end registers 
are loaded from the holding area, and Frame C will begin playing.  The 
end-of-frame signal causes Timer A to count down from 2 to 1.  When Frame 
C finishes its first repetit
on, Timer A counts down from 1 to 0 and interrupts.)

7.	Write a 1 to the DMA Sound Control Register to play the current 
frame, then stop.  Disable Timer A and mask its interrupt.  You're done.

As you can see, you program the timer to interrupt after one repetition 
less than the number of times you want a frame to play.  That is so you can 
set up the next frame while the DMA sound chip is playing the last 
repetition of the current frame.  T
is ensures seamless linkage of frames.

INTERRUPTS WITHOUT TIMER A

Besides going to the external input signal of Timer A, the DMA-sound-active 
signal, true high, is exclusive-ORed with the monochrome-detect signal, 
and together they form the GPIP I7 input to the M68901 MFP.  The intent of 
this is to provide for inte
rupt-driven sound drivers without using up the last general-purpose timer 
in the MFP.  It is a little trickier to use, however.  For one thing, 
it causes the interrupt at the end of every frame, not after a specified 
number of frames.  For another, t
e "interesting" edge on this signal depends on what kind of monitor 
you have. 
	
On an ST, monochrome monitors ground the mono-detect signal, so when you 
read the bit in the MFP you get a zero.  Color monitors do not ground it, 
so it reads as a one.  When the DMA sound is idle (0), this is still the 
case.  However, when the sound
is active (1), the mono-detect signal is inverted by the XOR, so the bit 
in the MFP reads the opposite way.  (The one place where the OS reads 
this bit is at VBLANK time, to see if you've changed monitors.  
The ROMs on any machine with DMA sound are 
ppropriately modified, so you need not worry about this.)  

If you want to use the mono-detect / DMA interrupt signal, you have to set 
up the active-edge register in the MFP to cause the interrupt at the right 
time.  The interesting edge on the DMA signal is the falling edge, that is, 
from active to idle; thi
 happens when a frame finishes.  If you have a monochrome monitor, this 
edge is seen as a transition from 1 to 0 on MFP bit I7.  However, with a 
color monitor, the edge will be seen as a transition from 0 to 1.  
Therefore, you have to program the MFP
s active-edge register differently depending on which monitor you have.  Make sure the DMA sound is idle (write a zero to the control register), then check MFP I7: if it's one, you have a color monitor, and you need to see the rising edge.  If it's z
ro, you have a monochrome monitor, and you need to see the falling edge.

The DMA sound active signal goes from "active" to "idle" when a frame finishes.  If it was playing in mode 1, it stays "idle" and the control register reverts to zero.  If it was playing in mode 3, the signal goes back to "active" as the next frame b
gins.  In this case, the signal is actually in the "idle" state for a very short time, but the MFP catches it and causes the interrupt, so don't worry.

Additional Considerations

Regardless of how you manage your interrupts, there is more you should know:  the signal goes from "active" to "idle" when the DMA sound chip has fetched the last sample in the frame.  There is a four-word FIFO in the chip, however, so it will be eig
t sample-times (four in stereo mode) before the sound actually finishes.  If you are using mode 1, you can use this time to set up the chip with the start and end addresses of the next frame, so it will start as soon as the current one ends.  However
 if the interrupt should be postponed for four or eight sample-times, you could miss your chance to start the sound seamlessly.  Therefore, for seamless linkage, use the pre-loading technique described above.

MICROWIRE¿ Interface

The MICROWIRE¿ interface provided to talk to the National LMC1992 Computer Controlled Volume / Tone Control is a general purpose MICROWIRE¿ interface to allow the future addition of other MICROWIRE¿ devices.  For this reason, the following descriptio
 of its use will make no assumptions about the device being addressed.

The MICROWIRE¿ bus is a three wire serial connection and protocol designed 
to allow multiple devices to be individually addressed by the controller.  
The length of the serial data stream depends on the destination device.  
In general, the stream cons
sts of N bits of address, followed by zero or more don't care bits, 
followed by M bits of data.  The hardware interface provided consists 
of two 16 bit read/write registers: one data register which contains 
the actual bit stream to be shifted out, an
 one mask register which indicates which bits are valid.

Let's consider a mythical device which requires two address bits and 
one data bit.  For this device the total bit stream is three bits 
(minimum).  Any three bits of the register pair may be used.  
However, since the most significant bit is shifted fi
st, the command will be received by the device soonest if the three most 
significant bits are used.  Let's assume: 01 is the device's address, 
D is the data to be written, and X's are don't cares.  Then all of the 
following register combinations will
provide the same information to the device.

1110 0000 0000 0000 Mask
01DX XXXX XXXX XXXX Data

0000 0000 0000 0111 Mask
XXXX XXXX XXXX X01D Data

0000 0001 1100 0000 Mask
XXXX XXX0 1DXX XXXX Data

0000 1100 0001 0000 Mask
XXXX 01XX XXXD XXXX Data

1100 0000 0000 0001 Mask
01XX XXXX XXXX XXXD Data

As you can see, the address bits must be contiguous, and so must the data 
bits, but they don't have to be contiguous with each other.

The mask register must be written before the data register.  
Sending commences when the data register is written and takes 
approximately 16æsec.  Subsequent writes to the data and mask registers 
are blocked until sending is complete.  Reading the reg
sters while sending is in progress will return a snapshot of the shift 
register shifting the data and mask out.  This means that you know it is 
safe to send the next command when these registers (or either one) 
return to their original state.  Note t
at the mask register does not need to be rewritten if it is already 
correct.  That is, when sending a series of commands the mask register 
only needs to be written once.


Volume and Tone Control

The LMC1992 is used to provide volume and tone control.  Before you go 
and find a data sheet for this part, be warned that we do not use all 
of its features.  Commands for the features we do use are listed below.

Communication with this device is achieved using the MICROWIRE¿ interface.  
See MICROWIRE INTERFACE the section for details.  The device has a two bit 
address field, address = 10, and a nine bit data field.  There is no way to 
reading the current set
ings.

Using the MICROWIRE¿ Interface and the Volume/Tone Control Chip

The MICROWIRE¿ interface is not hard to use: once you get it right, you'll 
never have to figure it out again.

The easiest way to use it is to ignore the flexibility, and just use one 
form for all commands.  Since the Volume/Tone chip is the only device, 
and it has a total of 11 bits of address and data, your mask should be 
$07ff.  If you're picky, you can us
 $ffe0, because the high-order bits are shifted out first, but it adds 
conceptual complexity.  With a mask of $07ff, the lower 9 bits of the 
data regsiter are used for the data, and the next higher two bits are 
for the address:

	Mask:	%0000 0111 1111 1111
	Data:	%xxxx x10d dddd dddd

Replace the d's with the command code and its data.  
For example, this combination sets the master volume to $14:

	Mask:	%0000 0111 1111 1111
	Data:	%xxxx x100 1101 0100

The other important concept you must understand is that the bits shift out 
of these registers as soon as you write the data, and it takes an 
appreciable time (16 æsec) to finish.  You can't attempt another write 
until the first one is finished.  If y
u read either register while it's being shifted out, you will see a 
"snapshot" of the data being shifted.  You know the shifting is complete 
when the mask returns to its original value.  (This theory is wrong if you 
use a mask which equals its origin
l value sometime during the shifting, but $07ff never does.)

Assuming you write $07ff into the mask register ahead of time, the 
following routine can be used to write new data from the D0 register to the 
volume/tone control chip:

	MWMASK	equ	$ffff8924
	MWDATA	equ	$ffff8922

	mwwrite:
		cmp.w	#$07ff,MWMASK	; wait for prev to finish
		bne.s	mwwrite		; loop until equal
		move.w	d0,MWDATA		; write the data
		rts					; and return

The purpose of the loop at the beginning is to wait until a previous write 
completes.  This loop is at the beginning of the routine, not the end, 
because waiting at the end would always force at 16 æsec delay, 
even if it's been longer than that since
the last write.
