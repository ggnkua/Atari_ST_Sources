Ok, you've been patient enough, here are two binaries that you can run
from the desktop. 
They have both been packed with Ice2.4, which, if I remember correctly,
works fine on a Falcon. (If it doesn't then I'm afraid you'll have to
unpack them using MegaDepack or something similar..)

KillThings and its level-editor are available (in source format!) from DT/Web
        http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/6273
you have any questions, then feel free to mail
        orm@sandbag.demon.co.uk
(but at the time of writing, I haven't checked my mail for a month, but this
is due to living out of a hotel and not getting a phoneline installed in my
new humble abode (yet..120quid to connect 4 wires.. sheesh..))
so don't worry if you don't receive a quick reply! =]
