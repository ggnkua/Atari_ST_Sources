This is the docfile for the non-SSI code for the Art Of Noise tracker.
This is NOT intended to be used with any other DSP effects, it's just
a straight 50Khz x-voice (up to 8 voice) stereo player. Just see the
opening lines of the source code to see how to start a modfile. All the
volume levels, no of tracks should be handled automatically by the
player, so it should be (fairly) easy to use. Have fun...
