Sound library source code and example routine

1997 Steven Tattersall, Avena

This Zipfile contains 68000 and DSP sources and data for a fairly
simple Protracker module player with 2 separate FX channels. All
channels give full stereo panning and movement effects.

This code may be used freely in any game or demo or production.
The ZIPfile may be freely copied.

However, I don't have much time these days to reply but I will try
my best...
