This packer was written by Karl and New Mode of DELTA FORCE.

The packer is SHAREWARE, so go on reading for more details.

NoisePakker is a packing system to pack samples and soundtracker
modules. Packratios of 50% on samples are guaranteed! The basic
algorithm is a lossy algorithm, but usually the quality of your
samples is even improved.

Try packing your NoisePakked files with Ice Packer, you'll get amazing
results afterwards. 70% average packratio on modules!

Not many instructions here, just some basic hints. For full information
