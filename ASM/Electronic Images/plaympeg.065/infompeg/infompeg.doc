InfoMPEG version 1.0
--------------------

    InfoMPEG is a small utility to parse MPEG-1 compatible video streams,
and return information that is easily attainable.
    InfoMPEG was written to provide a quick and convenient way of constructing
charts containing various details on MPEG streams, allowing comparisons to
easily be made.  It can also be used simply to find out the pixel resolution
and types of frames in a stream (can do so almost instantly).

InfoMPEG Options
----------------

Usage: InfoMPEG [-123] filename.mpg [filename.mpg ...]

Option '-1' should be used when the resolution and types of frames
	    in a bitstream are sufficient data.  This option is
	    very quick (can be used to scan through directories of
	    MPEG files in seconds using the wildcard string '*.MPG')

Option '-2' or Option '-3' should be used when '-1' does not return
	    enough data.  As with '-1', either option can be used on
	    a single MPEG file or with multiple files.  If more than
	    one file is specified, a summary chart will be displayed
	    at the end of output.
