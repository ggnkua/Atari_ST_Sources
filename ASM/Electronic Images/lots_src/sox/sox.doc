     DESCRIPTION
          Sox translates sound files from one format to another,
	  possibly doing a sound effect.

     OPTIONS
	  The option syntax is a little	grotty,	but in essence:
	       sox file.au file.voc
	  translates a sound sample in SUN Sparc .AU format into a
	  SoundBlaster .VOC file, while
	       sox -v 0.5 file.au -rate	12000 file.voc rate
	  does the same	format translation but also lowers the
	  amplitude by 1/2 and changes the sampling rate from 8000
          hertz to 12000 hertz via the rate sound effect loop.

	  File type options:

          -t filetype
		    gives the type of the sound	sample file.

          -r rate   Give sample     rate in Hertz of file.

          -s/-u/-U/-A
		    The	sample data is signed linear (2's complement),
		    unsigned linear, U-law (logarithmic), or A-law
		    (logarithmic).  U-law and A-law are	the U.S. and
		    international standards for	logarithmic telephone
		    sound compression.

          -b/-w/-l/-f/-d/-D
		    The	sample data is in bytes, 16-bit	words, 32-bit

     SOX(1)                UNIX System V                  SOX(1)



		    longwords, 32-bit floats, 64-bit double floats, or
		    80-bit IEEE	floats.	 Floats	and double floats are
		    in native machine format.

          -x            The sample data is in XINU format; that is, it
		    comes from a machine with the opposite word	order
		    than yours and must	be swapped according to	the
		    word-size given above.  Only 16-bit	and 32-bit
		    integer data may be	swapped.  Machine-format
		    floating-point data	is not portable.  IEEE floats
		    are	a fixed, portable format. ???

          -c channels
		    The	number of sound	channels in the	data file.
		    This may be	1, 2, or 4; for	mono, stereo, or quad
		    sound data.

	  General options:

          -e            after the input file allows you to avoid giving an
		    output file	and just name an effect.  This is only
                    useful with the stat effect.

          -v volume Change amplitude (floating point); less than 1.0
		    decreases, greater than 1.0	increases.  Note: we
		    perceive volume logarithmically, not linearly.
                    Note: see the stat effect.

          -V            Print a description of processing phases.  Useful
                    for figuring out exactly how sox is   mangling your
		    sound samples.

	  The input and	output files may be standard input and output.
          This is specified by '-'.  The -t type option     must be given
          in this case, else sox will not know the format of the given
          file.  The -t, -r, -s/-u/-U/-A, -b/-w/-l/-f/-d/-D and       -x
	  options refer	to the input data when given before the	input
	  file name.  After, they refer	to the output data.

          If you don't give an output file name, sox will just read
	  the input file.  This	is useful for validating structured
          file formats; the stat effect may also be used via the -e
	  option.

     FILE TYPES
          Sox needs to know the   formats of the input and output files.
	  File formats which have headers are checked, if that header
	  doesn't seem right, the program exits	with an	appropriate
	  message.  Currently, the raw (no header), IRCAM Sound	Files,
	  Sound	Blaster, SPARC .AU (w/header), Mac HCOM, PC/DOS	.SOU,
	  Sndtool, and Sounder,	NeXT .SND, Windows 3.1 RIFF/WAV,
	  Turtle Beach .SMP, and Apple/SGI AIFF	and 8SVX formats are

     SOX(1)                UNIX System V                  SOX(1)



	  supported.

          .aiff     AIFF files used on Apple IIc/IIgs and SGI.  Note:
		    the	AIFF format supports only one SSND chunk.  It
		    does not support multiple sound chunks, or the
		    8SVX musical instrument description	format.	 AIFF
		    files are multimedia archives and and can have
		    multiple audio and picture chunks.	You may	need a
		    separate archiver to work with them.

          .au       SUN Microsystems AU files.  There are apparently
		    many types of .au files; DEC has invented its own
		    with a different magic number and word order. The
		    .au	handler	can read these files but will not
		    write them.	 Some .au files	have valid AU headers
		    and	some do	not.  The latter are probably original
		    SUN	u-law 8000 hz samples.	These can be dealt
                    with using the .ul format (see below).

          .hcom     Macintosh HCOM files.  These are (apparently) Mac
		    FSSD files with some variant of Huffman
		    compression.  The Macintosh	has wacky file formats
		    and	this format handler apparently doesn't handle
		    all	the ones it should.  Mac users will need your
		    usual arsenal of file converters to	deal with an
		    HCOM file under Unix or DOS.

          .raw      Raw files (no header).
		    The	sample rate, size (byte, word, etc), and style
		    (signed, unsigned, etc.)  of the sample file must
		    be given.  The number of channels defaults to 1.

          .ub, .sb, .uw, .sw, .ul
		    These are several suffices which serve as a
		    shorthand for raw files with a given size and
                    style.  Thus, ub, sb, uw, sw, and ul correspond to
		    "unsigned byte", "signed byte", "unsigned word",
		    "signed word", and "ulaw" (byte).  The sample rate
		    defaults to	8000 hz	if not explicitly set, and the
		    number of channels (as always) defaults to 1.
		    There are lots of Sparc samples floating around in
		    u-law format with no header	and fixed at a sample
		    rate of 8000 hz.  (Certain sound management
		    software cheerfully	ignores	the headers.)
		    Similarly, most Mac	sound files are	in unsigned
		    byte format	with a sample rate of 11025 or 22050
		    hz.

          .sf       IRCAM Sound Files.
		    SoundFiles are used	by academic music software
		    such as the	CSound package,	and the	MixView	sound
		    sample editor.

          .voc      Sound Blaster VOC files.
		    VOC	files are multi-part and contain silence
		    parts, looping, and	different sample rates for
		    different chunks.  On input, the silence parts are
		    filled out,	loops are rejected, and	sample data
		    with a new sample rate is rejected.	 Silence with
		    a different	sample rate is generated
		    appropriately.  On output, silence is not
		    detected, nor are impossible sample	rates.

          .auto     This is a ``meta-type'': specifying this type for
		    an input file triggers some	code that tries	to
		    guess the real type	by looking for magic words in
		    the	header.	 If the	type can't be guessed, the
		    program exits with an error	message.  The input
		    must be a plain file, not a	pipe.  This type can't
		    be used for	output files.

          .smp      Turtle Beach SampleVision files.
		    SMP	files are for use with the PC-DOS package
		    SampleVision by Turtle Beach Softworks. This
		    package is for communication to several MIDI
		    samplers. All sample rates are supported by	the
		    package, although not all are supported by the
		    samplers themselves. Currently loop	points are
		    ignored.

          .wav      Windows 3.1 .WAV RIFF files.
		    These appear to be very similar to IFF files, but
		    not	the same. They are the native sound file
		    format of Windows 3.1.  Obviously, Windows 3.1 is
		    of such incredible importance to the computer
		    industry that it just had to have its own sound
		    file format.

     EFFECTS
	  Only one effect from the palette may be applied to a sound
          sample.  To do multiple effects you'll need to run sox in a
	  pipeline.

	  copy				Copy the input file to the
					output file.  This is the
					default	effect if both files
					have the same sampling rate,
					or the rates are "close".

	  rate				Translate input	sampling rate
					to output sampling rate	via
					linear interpolation to	the
					Least Common Multiple of the
					two sampling rates.  This is
					the default effect if the two

     SOX(1)                UNIX System V                  SOX(1)



					files have different sampling
					rates.	This is	fast but
					noisy.

	  avg				Mix 4- or 2-channel sound file
					into 2-	or 1-channel file by
					averaging the samples for
					different speakers.

	  stat				Do a statistical check on the
					input file, and	print results
					on the standard	error file.
                                        stat may copy the file
					untouched from input to
					output,	if you select an
					output file. The "Volume
					Adjustment:" field in the
					statistics gives you the
                                        argument to the -v number
					which will make	the sample as
					loud as	possible.

          echo [ delay volume ... ]     Add echoing to a sound sample.
					Each delay/volume pair gives
					the delay in seconds and the
					volume (relative to 1.0) of
					that echo.  If the volumes add
					up to more than	1.0, the sound
					will melt down instead of
					fading away.

          vibro speed  [ depth ]        Add the world-famous Fender
					Vibro-Champ sound effect to a
					sound sample by	using a	sine
					wave as	the volume knob.
                                        Speed gives the   Hertz value of
					the wave.  This	must be	under
                                        30.  Depth gives the amount
					the volume is cut into by the
					sine wave, ranging 0.0 to 1.0
					and defaulting to 0.5.

          lowp center                   Apply a low-pass filter.  The
					frequency response drops
                                        logarithmically with center
					frequency in the middle	of the
					drop.  The slope of the	filter
					is quite gentle.

          band [ -n ] center [ width ]  Apply a band-pass filter.  The
					frequency response drops
					logarithmically	around the

     SOX(1)                UNIX System V                  SOX(1)



                                        center frequency.  The width
					gives the slope	of the drop.
                                        The frequencies at center +
                                        width and center - width will
					be half	of their original
                                        amplitudes.  Band defaults to
					a mode oriented	to pitched
					signals, i.e. voice, singing,
                                        or instrumental music.  The -n
					(for noise) option uses	the
					alternate mode for un-pitched
                                        signals.  Band introduces
					noise in the shape of the
					filter,	i.e. peaking at	the
                                        center frequency and settling
					around it.

          Sox enforces certain effects.    If the two files have
	  different sampling rates, the	requested effect must be one
          of copy, or rate, If the two files have different numbers of
          channels, the avg effect must be requested.

     BUGS
	  The syntax is	horrific.  It's	very tempting to include a
	  default system that allows an	effect name as the program
	  name and just	pipes a	sound sample from standard input to
	  standard output, but the problem of inputting	the sample
	  rates	makes this unworkable.
