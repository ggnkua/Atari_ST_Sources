   =============================================================================
   Changes since release 2.91:

   Invalid scan codes
      NKCC now recognizes invalid scan codes and transforms them to proper
      normalized key codes. See chapter 3 of the documentation file for
      details.


   =============================================================================
   Changes since release 2.90:

   conterm ($484)
      nkc_init sets bit 3 of the system variable <conterm> to receive the status
      of Shift/Control/Alternate along with the key codes returned by BIOS.
      In older versions of NKCC the function nkc_exit restored the complete
      <conterm> variable to the value it had before nkc_init. This has been
      abandoned because a parallel running process may have changed <conterm>
      for own purposes and thus get into trouble after NKCC has terminated.


   New deadkeys
      Two new deadkey assignments were added:

      / + 2 -> ´
      / + 4 -> ¨


   Notes for programmers
      The file header of NKCC.S (and the source extract NKCC.TXT) now contains
      notes about the special directive syntax of the MadMac assembler, which
      was used to develop NKCC. This information should help you to adjust
      the source files to a different assembler (e.g. when you like to expand
      or modify NKCC).

      NOTE: it's not allowed to distribute a modified NKCC package (especially
            via mailbox)!

   Changes since release 2.81:

   New address
      Please use the new address shown above to contact the NKCC developer!


   Key code converter
      Two new functions were introduced: nkc_n2tos() and nkc_n2gem(). Both
      convert key codes back to the system's format (either in 32 bit format
      or 16 bit format without flag byte).


   Upper case/lower case
      The upper/lower case translation tables nkc_toupper and nkc_tolower
      were replaced by functions with the same names. Just change your
      source code the following way:

      a = nkc_toupper[b]      becomes        a = nkc_toupper(b)
      a = nkc_tolower[b]      becomes        a = nkc_tolower(b)


   GEM parameter arrays
      NKCC now uses its own parameter arrays rather than sharing the arrays
      with Turbo C/Pure C. Their names have be changed from _intin,
      _intout ... to nkc_intin, nkc_intout ... - which is only interesting
      for assembler programmers who use the nkc_amulti function.

      The nkc_init function gets one additional parameter: a pointer to
      the application's GLOBAL array (which is initialized by the AES
      function appl_init and which contains information used for AES
      calls; NKCC couldn't use an own one). For Pure C this would be:

      nkc_init(NKI_BUTHND,vdi_handle,_GemParBlk.global);

      If the button event handler is _not_ used, the pointer is ignored and
      therefore may be NULL:

      nkc_init(0,0,NULL);

      The NKCC version NKC_GPB.O is no longer useful because of this new
      mechanism. It has been deleted.
