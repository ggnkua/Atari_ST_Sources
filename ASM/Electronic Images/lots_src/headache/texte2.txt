          YOHO, GUYS!          WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?          MINDBOMBING, ISN'T IT?          NO?          OK...                                                                                                                                                                                                  AND NOW, THE TWO SCROLLERS AT THE SAME TIME!                             AH, AH, AH, AH!          YEP, FELLOWS, THIS IS 'THE ULTIMATE HEADACHE DEMO' BY OVERLANDERS!          ARE YOU STILL READING?         WELL, THIS SHOULD BE - HUMUNGUS - AT THE KEYBOARD, SINCE HE CODED THIS MAIN PART OF THE DEMO BUT THIS IS, IN FACT, - DOGUE DE MAUVE - TYPING THIS LITTLE SCROLLER...           WHY? WELL, BECAUSE HUMUNGUS HAS GONE FOR SOME NICE VACATIONS TWO HOURS AFTER FINISHING THIS DEMO - IT WAS VERY JUST! - AND HE COULDN'T MANAGE TO WRITE ANYTHING FOR HIS TWO 'TURNING SCROLLERS'. WHAT A PITY!                    SO, SINCE I'M STILL THERE - I'M NOT IN HOLIDAYS! -, I'M GOING TO WRITE SOME STUFF INSTEAD OF HIM. AND I WILL TRY TO TELL YOU THINGS HE WOULD HAVE TOLD...                    FIRST, I WANT TO SEND HUMUNGUS A VERY BIG 'HI!' AND WISH HIM SOME VERY NICE HOLIDAYS SKIING AND HAVING FUN IN THE MOUNTAINS. HAVE FUN, HUMUNGUS!                    WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS SCREEN?          WELL, I THINK THAT HUMUNGUS' WORK ON THIS IS GREAT. IT LOOKS QUITE GOOD AND QUITE ORIGINAL, TOO. I KNOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERED TO HAVE A FEW MORE DAYS TO IMPROVE IT A BIT - ESPECIALLY FOR THE BORDER CLIPPING OF THE SCROLLERS - BUT WE'RE BOTH QUITE HAPPY WITH OUR WORK.          PERHAPS SHOULD I REMIND YOU THAT WE WERE GFA BASIC CODERS BEFORE AND THIS IS OUR FIRST REAL SCREEN IN ASSEMBLER - WELL, IN FACT, HUMUNGUS ALREADY MADE A SMALL INTRO FOR OUR SECOND 'COMPIL CODE' -.          WE BOTH KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE BEST DEMO SO FAR BUT YOU HOPE YOU'LL FIND IT ACCEPTABLE FOR A FIRST SCREEN. WE TRIED TO PROGRAM IT IN A CAREFUL WAY AND TO IMPROVE IT WITH SOME ORIGINAL FEATURES SUCH AS MY 'MELTING' SCROLLER, HIS TURNING SCROLLINGS AND 'HYPNOTIC' STARFIELD.          WELL, OBVIOUSLY, - INNER CIRCLE - FOUND IT GOOD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IT IN THEIR DEMO AND WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR THIS...          ARE YOU STILL THERE? WELL, YOU'RE VERY COURAGEOUS, SINCE THIS IS NOT AN EASY SCROLL TO READ!          IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GREETINGS, JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE INTRO SCROLLER - YEAH! YOU'VE TO RELOAD THIS DEMO! -.          I THINK I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU NOW 'COZ IT'S VERY LATE AND I STILL HAVE TO WRITE THE OTHER SCROLLER AND SEND THE WHOLE DEMO TO - GRIFF - FROM INNER CIRCLE...          I AND HUMUNGUS WISH YOU A VERY NICE DAY! HAVE FUN WITH THIS MEGADEMO AND MAY THE MAUVE BE WITH YOU ALL!!!          OVERLANDERS SAY 'WARP'...
