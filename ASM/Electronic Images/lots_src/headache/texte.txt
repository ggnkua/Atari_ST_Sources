WELL, FIRST, THIS SCREEN WAS ENTIRELY CODED BY - HUMUNGUS - WHO ALSO MADE ALL GRAPHIX (EXCEPT THE LITTLE SPRITES BY - FURYO -). THE INCREDIBLY MAGNIFICIENT RASTERS WERE DESIGNED BY THE ONE AND ONLY DOGUE DE MAUVE (ME!) WHO HAD TO WORK ON THEM WITH HUMUNGUS BESIDE HIM TELLING THEY WERE GOING TO BE THE UGLIEST RASTERS SO FAR...     OOPS, SORRY HUMUNGUS, I FORGOT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE "YOUR# SCROLLING!!!     SO, HUMUNGUS HOPES YOU LIKE THIS LITTLE SCREEN, WHICH IS HIS SECOND ASM PRODUCTION (I PERSONNALLY THINK HE MADE VERY FAST PROGRESS AND WILL SOON REACH A BRILLIANT CODING LEVEL... WHICH SEEMS TO BE UNLIKELY THE CASE FOR MYSELF!!!)     WHAT ELSE?     BOTH OF US WOULD LIKE TO SEND A BIG "HI!# TO ALL THE OTHER - OVERLANDERS - MEMBERS AND TO - INNER CIRCLE - FOR INCLUDING THIS SCREEN IN THEIR SECOND - BE LATE - GREAT DEMO.
