                               WHATTHEHELLISTHISMELTINGSHRINKINGFUCKINGANDPROBABLYMUCKRACKINGSCROLLER?!?            IS IT A PLANE?            IS IT A BOAT?          IS IT A CAR?            IS IT A BIKE?           IS IT A JOKE?           NO, THIS IS JUST THE INTRO SCREEN OF "THE ULTIMATE HEADACHE DEMO# BY OVERLANDERS OF THE UNION ! (WE HAVE DONE THIS INTRO AND THE SCREEN IN FEBRUARY 1991 AND THE LOST BOYS HAVE CODED THEIR 'OOH CRICKEY WOT A SCORCHER' MEANWHILE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO CODE AN IMPROVE VERSION !).        THIS INTRO-SCREEN WAS CODED BY THE ONE AND (FORTUNATELY) ONLY - DOGUE DE MAUVE - AND THE MAIN SCREEN IS BY - HUMUNGUS -.           I (DOGUY) WOULD LIKE TO SEND SOME BIG GREETINGS AND HUGE THANX (WILL THEY ALL FIT IN A SINGLE SCROLLINE???) TO THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO TOOK PART TO THIS DEMO:           - DOCLANDS - WHO MADE THE MUZAK YOU'RE LISTENING TO (PUMP UP THE VOLUME, GUY!). DOCLANDS IS A BRILLIANT MUSICIAN, ALTHOUGH HE KEEPS ON TELLING HE ISN'T WORTH A DIME... WELL, JUST GIVE A EAR TO THIS TUNE, COMPOSED 6 MONTHS AGO AND YOU'LL SEE BY YOURSELF...            - FURYO - WHO MADE THE NICE "OVERLANDERS# LOGO AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND THE LITTLE FONT WE USE FOR THE SPRITES - VERY NICE, ISN'T IT? -. THANX, FURYO, AND KEEP ON DRAWING!           - HUMUNGUS - WHO MADE THE MAIN PART OF DIS DEMO (PRESS SPACE AND BE PATIENT FOR 25 SECONDS...) AND ALSO HELPED ME WITH THIS SCREEN.             - LUDUG - WHO MADE THIS NICE 2 BITPLANES FONT. HE'S A VERY TALENTED GRAPHIST ON AMIGA AND HE ALSO DESIGNS SOME STUFF FOR OVERLANDERS            - WALTER - WHO MADE THE BUBBLE SPRITES. WALTER IS A VERY NICE AND FAST GRAPHIST WHO SENT US MANY BEAUTIFUL DRAWINGS. HE NOW WORKS WITH ADSO AND DOCLANDS ON THEIR ACTION GAME PROJECT.           SORRY, DUDES, I KNOW THAT AFTER MY GFA DEMOS, YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING FAR BETTER THAN THIS CRAP SCREEN IN ASSEMBLER. BUT ASM ISN'T THAT EASY AND I'M PROBABLY NOT THAT GOOD AT CODING, EITHER!            BY THE WAY, I HAD QUITE FEW TIME TO SPEND ON THIS SINCE MY SCHEDULE IS HEAVILY PACKED AND I'M VERY BUSY WITH THE CREW AND EVERYTHING... SOMETIMES, IT'S HARD TO BE THE (VICE-)BOSS!
