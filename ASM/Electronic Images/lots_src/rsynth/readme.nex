\b0 \
This is a text to speech system produced by integrating various pieces of code and tables of data, which are all (I believe) in the public domain.\
\
The bulk of the integration was done by Nick Ing-Simmons.\
See the file README for more info.\
\
The port to the NeXT was done by Ben Stuyts.\
(benstn@olivetti.nl -- NeXT Mail Welcome.)\
\

\b Getting started\

\b0 \
Simply type "make -f makefile.next" and "say Welcome to the NeXT world"\
\

\b A summary\

\b0 \

\li540 Command line options:\

	-q				turns on warnings\
    	-c num-cascade	Switches to CASCADE_PARALLEL with number of cascaded formants\
    	-f mSec-per-frame	Sets frame length\
    	-I				Impulsive source (default is "NATURAL")\
	-F number		f0_flutter value\
	-t number			voicing spectral tilt in dB,  0 to 24\
	-p file			file to save holmes parameters to.\
	-S number		speed, default =1, larger means slower\
	-K number		umm...\

say "words words and more words".\
say "[phonemes]".\
say < file\
\
say\
type words from stdin. A dot end a sentence and starts the conversion.\

\li0 \
Don't expect too much speed: on my 25 MHz cube the generation of 8 KHz speech takes as long as the speech itself. The bottleneck seems to be in nsynth.c, where most of the computation is done in floating point.\
\

\b Dictionary\

\b0 \
You can get the (optional) pronunciation dictionary that is used in dict.c at:\
\
	ota.ox.ac.uk:/pub/ota/dicts/710/text710.dat\
\
Be warned that it is 9 MB. With compress it goes down to about 1 MB though. This file is expected at /usr/local/lib/text710.dat. (See dict.c)\
\

\b Services:\

\b0 \
Here's a Tickle-service you can use to say any text.:\
\

\f1\fs20\li540 # Begin TickleServices Version 1.01 Data\
"Menu Item" = "Tickle Services/Say";\
"Send Type" = "NXAsciiPboardType";\
"Tcl" = "\\\
# Speak the selection\
\
exec say << [pasteboard read]\
";\
# End TickleServices Data\

\f0\fs24\li0 \

\b Known bugs:\

\b0 \
A fixed size buffer is used (in hplay.c) as a sound buffer. It is 1 MB, so you probably won't notice it. It might dump core on you though: This happens if you give it a very long sentence, and/or a high sample rate.\
