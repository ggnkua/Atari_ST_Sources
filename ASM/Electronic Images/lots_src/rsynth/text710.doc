June 1992  (supersedes the versions of March and Nov 1986)


     In 1985-86 I produced a dictionary file called CUVOALD  (Computer
Usable Version of the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary).  This was
a partial dictionary of English in computer-usable  form  -  "partial"
because  each  entry  contained  only some of the information from the
original  dictionary,  and  "computer-usable"  (rather   than   merely
"computer-readable")  because  it  was in a form that made it easy for
programs to access it.  A second file, called CUV2,  was  produced  at
the  same time.  This was derived from CUVOALD and was the same except
that it also contained all inflected forms explicitly, eg it contained
"added",  "adding" and "adds" as well as "add".  I have now added some
information to each entry and some more entries to CUV2, to produce  a
new version of CUV2.  This document describes this new file.

     These files were derived  originally  from  the  Oxford  Advanced
Learner's  Dictionary of Current English [1], third edition, published
by the Oxford University Press, 1974, the machine-readable version  of
which  is  available to researchers from the Oxford Text Archive.  The
task of deriving them from the machine-readable OALDCE was carried out
as  part  of  a research project, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, into
spelling correction.  The more recent additions have been carried  out
as  part  of my research as a lecturer in Computer Science at Birkbeck
College.

THE FILE FORMAT

     CUV2 contains 70646  entries.   Each  entry  occupies  one  line.
Samples  are  given at the end of this document.  The longest spelling
is 23 characters; the longest pronunciation is also  23;  the  longest
syntactic-tag  field  is  also  (coincidentally)  23;  the  number  of
syllables is  just  one  character  ('1'  to  '9'),  and  the  longest
verb-pattern  field  is  58.  The fields are padded with spaces to the
lengths of the longest, ie 23, 23, 23, 1 and  58,  making  the  record
length  128.   The spelling begins at position 1, the pronunciation at
position 24, the syntactic-tag field at position  47,  the  number  of
syllables  is  character  70,  and  the  verb-pattern  field begins at
position 71.  The file is sorted in ASCII  sequence;  this  means,  of
course, that the entries are not in the same order as in the OALDCE.

WHAT THE DICTIONARY CONTAINS

     Each entry consists of a spelling, a pronunciation, one  or  more
syntactic  tags (parts-of-speech) with rarity flags, a syllable count,
and a set of verb patterns for verbs.

     The first file derived from the OALDCE  (CUVOALD)  contained  all
the headwords and subentries from the original dictionary - subentries
are words like "abandonment" which comes under the headword  "abandon"
-  except for a handful that contained funny characters (such as "Lsd"
where the "L" was a pound sign).  Subentries were not included if they
consisted  of  two  or three separate words that occurred individually
elsewhere in the dictionary, such as "division bell" which comes under
the   headword  "division",  except  when  the  combination  formed  a
syntactic unit not immediately predictable from its  constituents,  eg
"above  board",  which  is listed as an adverb.  To this list of about
35,000 entries, I added about 2,500 proper names -  common  forenames,
British   towns   with   a   population   of  over  5,000,  countries,
nationalities, states, counties and major  cities  of  the  world.   I
would like to have added many more proper names, but I didn't have the
time.

     The second version of the file (CUV2) contained all these entries
plus  inflected  forms  making a total of about 68,000 entries.  Since
1986 I have made a number of corrections, added the rarity  flags  and
the  syllable  counts  and  inserted about 2,000 new entries.  The new
entries, nearly all of which were derived forms of  words  already  in
the  dictionary,  were  selected from a list of several thousand words
that occurred in the LOB Corpus[3] but were not in CUV2.  I also  made
changes  to  existing  entries  where  these  were  implied by the new
entries; for example, when adding  a  plural  form  of  a  word  whose
existing  tag was "uncountable", it was necessary to change the tag of
the  singular  form.   I  also  added  about  300  reasonably   common
abbreviations (see note below).

     A number of words (ie spellings) have more than one entry in  the
OALDCE,  eg "water 1" (noun) and "water 2" (verb).  In CUV2, each word
has only one entry unless it  has  two  different  pronunciations,  eg
"abuse"  (noun  and verb).  I have departed from this rule in the case
of compound adjectives, such as "hard-working", which have a  slightly
different   stress   pattern   depending  on  whether  they  are  used
attributively ("she's a hard-working girl") or  predicatively  ("she's
very hard-working").  These are entered only once; they generally have
the attributive stress pattern except when the predicative one  seemed
the  more natural.  (See also the note below on abbreviations.) I have
also given only one entry to those words that  have  strong  and  weak
forms  of  pronunciation, such as "am" (which can be pronounced &m, @m
or m).  Generally it is the strong form that is entered.

     As regards the coverage  of  the  dictionary,  readers  might  be
interested  in  a paper by Geoffrey Sampson [4] in which he analyses a
set of words from a sample of the LOB Corpus[3] that were not in CUV2.
The  recent  additions  should have gone some way to plugging the gaps
that his study identified.

THE SPELLINGS

     The spelling contains the characters "A"  to  "Z",  "a"  to  "z",
hyphen, apostrophe, space, umlaut or diaeresis (HEX 22), cedilla (3C),
circumflex (5E),  acute  (5F),  grave  (60)  and  tilde  (7E).   These
diacritic  characters  precede the letter that they mark, eg "se~nor".
(There are also the characters "5" and "6" in "MI5" and "MI6".)

THE PRONUNCIATIONS

     The pronunciation uses a set of  characters  very  like  the  one
adopted  by  the  Alvey Speech Club for representing IPA in ASCII [2].
The system is as follows:

 i   as in  bead       N  as in  sing
 I           bid       T         thin
 e           bed       D         then
 & (ampsnd)  bad       S         shed
 A          bard       Z        beige
 0 (zero)    cod      tS         etch
 O (cap O)  cord      dZ         edge
 U          good
 u          food       p t k b d g
 V           bud       m n f v s z
 3 (three)  bird       r l w h j
 @  "a" in about

eI   as in   day      R-linking (the sounding
@U            go      of a /r/ at the end of a
aI           eye      word when it is
aU           cow      followed by a vowel)
oI           boy      is marked R
I@          beer      eg fAR for "far"
e@          bare      (compare "far away"
U@          tour      with "far beyond").

Primary stress: apostrophe eg @'baUt ("about")
Secondary stress : comma eg ,&ntI'septIk
Plus-sign as in "courtship" and "bookclub"
'kOt+Sip  'bUk+klVb

When the spelling contains a space and/or a
hyphen, the pronunciation has one also, eg
above board  @,bVv 'bOd   air-raid  'e@-reId

THE SYNTACTIC TAGS

     Every entry in the dictionary has  at  least  one  syntactic  tag
(part-of-speech  code).   If  an  entry has more than one (eg "report"
noun and verb), they are in ASCII order and separated  by  commas.   A
code  consists  of three characters, the first two being the syntactic
tag and the third a frequency class.  The first is one of the  capital
letters "G" to "Z" (inclusive), which have the following meanings:


                                                                Page 4


G  Anomalous verb
H  Transitive verb
I  Intransitive verb
J  Both transitive and intransitive verb

K  Countable noun
L  Uncountable noun
M  Both countable and uncountable noun
N  Proper noun

O  Adjective
P  Adverb
Q  Pronoun
R  Definite article
S  Indefinite article
T  Preposition
U  Prefix
V  Conjunction
W  Interjection
X  Particle
Y  Abbreviation
Z  Not classified

     Into the M class go nouns used frequently in both ways,  such  as
"coffee"  ("a  pot  of  coffee", "two coffees please"), and also nouns
that  are  predominantly  one  or  the  other;  they  may  be   mainly
uncountable  with  an  occasional  countable  use, such as "waste" and
"understanding" ("the barren wastes", "reach  an  understanding"),  or
mainly  countable  with an occasional uncountable use, like "ceremony"
and "line" ("too much ceremony", "stand in line").

     The second character in the tag code is either in the  group  "0"
(zero)  to  "9", "@", or "A" to "E", in which case it indicates how to
form inflexions, or it is one of the characters "a"  to  "z",  "+"  or
"-",  in  which  case  it gives some extra information about the word.
(Abbreviations have the following extra  code  symbols,  not  used  by
other entries:  ">", ")", "]", "}", ":", "=" and "~".)

     The inflexion codes "0"  to  "5"  are  for  verbs  and  have  the
following meanings:

0  stem+s, stem+ing, stem+ed (like "work")
1  stem+es, stem+ing, stem+ed (like "wish")
2  replace final "e" by es, ing or ed (like "love")
3  replace final "y" by ies, ying or ied (like "apply")
4  stem+s; double final letter +ing or +ed (like "abet")
5  all inflexions are given in full since at least one of them
   is irregular

     The inflexion codes "6" to "@" are for nouns:

6  add s to form the plural (like "cat")
7  add es (like "fox")
8  replace final y by ies (like "pony")
9  plural is the same as the singular (like "sheep")

                                                                Page 5


   (if there is another plural form, this is entered
    separately, eg "herring" - "shoals of herring/
    we'll have the herrings for tea")
@  no plural

     The remaining inflexion codes "A" to "E" are for adjectives:

A  No -r or -st form
B  Comp is +r, Sup is +st (like "subtle")
C  +er, +est (like "light")
D  Change final y to ier, iest (like "heavy")
E  Comp or Sup irregular - given in full

     The letters "a" to "z" give extra  information  about  the  word.
The letters "a" to "h" follow verbs, with the following meaning:

a  3rd person sing present tense
b  present participle (-ing form)
c  past tense
d  past participle
e  some other part of the verb

f to h follow anomalous verbs only:

f  contraction of pronoun with verb
g  contraction of verb with "not"
h  other contraction

     The letters "i" to "o" follow nouns:

i  singular form (pl is irregular or non-existent)
j  plural form
k  plural in form but behaves like a singular,
   eg "economics"  (may be used as a plural also,
   eg "acoustics is a modern science/ the acoustics
      of this hall are dreadful")

l to o follow proper nouns only:

l  forenames of people
m  countries, states, counties
n  towns and cities
o  other

     The letters "p" to "t" follow adjectives:

p  only used predicatively
q  only used attributively
r  comparative
s  superlative
t  can be attached to a preceding word by a hyphen

     The remaining small letters (and "+") are as follows:

u  adverb (not interrog or relative)

                                                                Page 6


v  interrogative adverb
w  relative adverb
+  adverbial particle

x  pronoun (not interrog or relative)
y  interrogative pronoun
z  relative pronoun

     If the first character of the tag code is "R" to "X" or "Z",  the
second   character  is  always  "-",  ie  there  is  never  any  extra
information about words in these classes.

     The  following  characters  are  used   only   after   "Y"   (the
abbreviation code):
>  singular noun  (see notes below)
)  plural noun
]  both sing and plur
}  uncountable noun
:  title
=  proper noun
~  other

     Examples of tags are:  K7, countable noun that forms  its  plural
by  adding  es;  H3,  transitive  verb  that forms its inflexions like
"apply"; Ic, past tense of an intransitive verb; Qz, relative pronoun;
T-,  preposition.   The  syntactic  tags are presented in tabular form
later in this document.

     There is, intentionally, some redundancy in this  coding  system.
With  the exception of "-", any given character in the second position
only occurs with a particular wordclass; a "6", for example, can  only
qualify a noun, an "r" can only qualify an adjective, and so on.  This
makes the programming a bit easier.  There is, obviously, no  mnemonic
significance  to the codes; it is not intended that people should have
to read these codes directly.

THE RARITY FLAGS

     The third character of the syntactic tag is either  "*",  "%"  or
"$".   This  is  a  marker of word-frequency.  "*" means that the word
occurs in the most frequent 500 words of the LOB Corpus[3], the  Brown
Corpus[5], the Thorndike-Lorge word count[6] and the American Heritage
Word Frequency Book[7], ie it occurs in the most frequent 500  of  all
four lists.

     The "$" code means that the word is, in my opinion, rare, with my
opinions  being  combined  to some extent with those of two friends of
mine.   I  realise  that  this  definition  of  rarity  seems   highly
unscientific,  but  there is no appreciably better way of doing it.  I
could perhaps have taken the opinions of many more  people,  but  this
would  have  been  a  long job and I doubt if the resulting list would
have   been   much   different.    The   problem   is   that   today's
computer-readable  corpora,  while  certainly  large enough to provide
data about common words, are nowhere near large enough to provide data
about  rare words.  A word that fails to appear in a corpus of several

                                                                Page 7


million words is not necessarily rare; conversely, a word that appears
several  times  in  one sample might still be rare in general use.  My
spelling corrector needed to know something  about  the  frequency  of
words  in  its  dictionary  and,  in  the absence of hard data, it was
better for it to have my estimates than none at all.

     The third code "%" is by far the commonest in the dictionary  and
denotes words that are neither "*" nor "$".

     The rarity codes are  attached  to  tags  rather  than  to  words
because  a  word  can be common in one use but rare in another.  "Go",
for example, is very common as a verb, but less common as a noun.  The
OALDCE  lists  "aneroid" as adjective and noun.  While I am reasonably
familiar with this word in the phrase  "aneroid  barometer",  I  can't
remember ever coming across it as a noun.

THE VERB PATTERNS

     The final string of letters and numbers, separated by commas,  is
for  verbs  only,  and  shows  the  "verb  patterns"  -  the  sentence
structures - in which the verbs can occur.  If an entry has more  than
one  verb pattern, they are entered in number order and then in letter
order within numbers.   This  (fairly  complicated)  system  is  taken
straight from the OALDCE, and is explained in the book's introduction.

THE SYLLABLE COUNTS

     The number of syllables was computed for each  word  by  separate
algorithms  applied  to  the  spelling and the pronunciation.  If they
produced the same number, as they did in the great majority of  cases,
this  was  entered in the dictionary.  The remaining three thousand or
so I did by hand.

     For the great majority of  words,  the  number  of  syllables  is
obvious.   There  are  a few, however, for which this is not the case.
The problems generally concern the "@" phoneme.

     The sounds "I@" ("pier"), "U@" ("tour") and "aI@"  ("hire")  seem
sometimes  to  be  one syllable and sometimes two.  I find that my own
feelings - and those of others I have spoken to -  are  influenced  by
the  spelling  of  the  word.  Whereas I am happy to count "higher" as
having two syllables, I am not so sure about "hire".   Similarly  with
"sear"  (one)  and  "seer" (two).  The sounds that follow the "@" also
seem to have an effect.  While I might be persuaded  that  "fire"  has
two  syllables,  I  would be not happy about "fire-alarm" having four.
Similarly, if "acquire" has three, does "acquiring" have four?

     The problem is that the "@" is such a small  part  of  the  sound
that  it  hardly  qualifies  as  a  syllable.  If, on the one hand, it
signifies the presence of a morpheme, its status seems raised and I am
happy  to  accept  it as a syllable.  If, on the other hand, it has no
special status and, furthermore, the adjacent sounds cause  it  almost
to  disappear, then I can't bring myself to call it a syllable at all.
If it is in-between, then I am simply not sure.  Being forced to  make
a  decision,  I  have generally counted "fire/hire/wire/pier/tour" and

                                                                Page 8


the like as one syllable, but, on another day,  I  might  easily  have
counted them as two.

     There is another continuum of "@" sounds in the middle  of  words
like  "labelling".   Some  seem  fairly  clear,  such as "enamelling";
others not so, like "gambling" and "peddling"  (and  are  "gambolling"
and "pedalling" any different?).  I suspect my decisions on these have
been somewhat arbitrary, depending on  whether  a  pronunciation  with
more "@" or less "@" seemed more natural at the time.

     One more group  of  problematic  words  are  those  ending  "ion"
pronounced sometimes "I@n" and sometimes "j@n".  I can imagine a vicar
intoning the word "communion" in church so as to give it a  full  four
syllables,  but  then ordering a case of communion wine over the phone
and giving it only three.  "Champion" in "Champion the  Wonder  Horse"
had  three  but  in  "We are the champions" it has two.  Some of these
have only  one  regular  pronunciation  -  "companion",  for  example,
clearly  has  three  syllables  -  but,  for  the others, I suspect my
decisions depended on which pronunciation came  to  mind  when  I  was
considering them.

THE ABBREVIATION ENTRIES

     Largely because of the paper  by  Geoffrey  Sampson  referred  to
above,  I have included many more abbreviations in the 1992 version of
the dictionary, but I have done so with some reluctance since they  do
not fit easily into the existing scheme.

     There were about 50 abbreviations (examples include  "eg",  "ie",
"OAP"  and "TNT") in the previous version, because they were listed in
the main body of the OALDCE.  They were not given any distinctive tags
in  the 1986 version of CUV2.  This was a nuisance since, for example,
any algorithm attempting to match spelling and pronunciation would  be
puzzled  by  an  entry such as "etc" pronounced It'set@r@.  I have now
added about 300 abbreviations that  seemed  to  me  to  be  reasonably
common, and given all abbreviations their own tag.

     Some abbreviations, such as  "amp"  and  "rev",  seem  to  behave
pretty  much  like  ordinary  words  and  I  have  not  marked them as
abbreviations.  The rest now have their own tag - "Y".  (The Y tag  in
the  previous  version was used for adverbial particles; these are now
tagged P+.)

     Some abbreviations  clearly  have  their  own  pronunciation,  eg
UNESCO,  and  others  clearly  don't,  eg cwt (hundredweight).  I have
given them their own pronunciation when  it  seemed  to  me  that  the
abbreviation  was sometimes pronounced on its own.  For example, I can
imagine someone saying that some event takes place in dZ&n @n feb (Jan
and Feb), but I can't imagine them saying it takes place in mAr @n &pr
                               _
(Mar and Apr), so "Jan" gets dZn whereas "Apr" gets 'eIprIl.  But this
is often pretty arbitrary.

     It is not uncommon for two words to share the same  abbreviation,
eg "Dr" for "Doctor" and "Drive" or "St" for "Saint" and "Street".  It
would have been a possibility  to  put  in  two  (or  sometimes  more)

                                                                Page 9


entries  for such items, along the lines of "convert" (noun and verb),
but I did not feel that 'd0kt@R (or draIv) was  the  pronunciation  of
"Dr"  in  the  way  that 'k0nv3t (or k@n'v3t) was the pronunciation of
"convert", so I was unwilling to give such abbreviations two  or  more
entries,  but  at  the  same  time  I  wanted  to put something in the
pronunciation field, so I just put one of the pronunciations in.

     There is also an unsatisfactorily arbitrary quality  to  some  of
the  tags.   Abbreviations  that can go after an article or possessive
("my PhD", "an FRS", "the MCC") were tagged singular noun ("Y>"),  and
a  few  can  be  plural  ("GCSEs")  ("Y)").   Some,  mostly  units  of
measurement ("cc", "rpm"),  can  be  both  ("Y]").   Uncountable  noun
abbreviations  ("LSD",  "TB") get "Y}".  Titles ("Mr", "Col") get "Y:"
while proper names ("Mon", "Aug") or abbreviations likely to form part
of  a  proper name ("Ave", "Rd") get "Y=".  Others ("asap", "viz") get
"Y~".  Oddly, some organization names seem to be proper names ("RADA",
"UNESCO") while others don't ("the BBC", "the UN").

     In short, then, I am uneasy about many of the  decisions  I  have
had  to  make in order to get these abbreviation entries into the same
form as the rest of the dictionary, but the important  thing  is  that
they  are  now  in  the  dictionary,  so a piece of software using the
dictionary will recognize them, and they are distinctively tagged  for
anyone who wants to take them out.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

     Most of the work of extracting the required information from  the
machine-readable  OALDCE,  putting  it into a standard form in CUVOALD
and generating CUV2 was carried out by me  between  January  1985  and
March  1986.  I added the rarity flags in 1988 and the syllable counts
in 1990 and inserted the new entries in  March-June 1992.  Susan  Drew
keyed  in  the pronunciations of some of the entries, and the file was
proofread by Philip Baker,  Sylvia Davidson,  Ann Jones,  Ed Hastings,
Kate Murray  and  Diana Whitaker.   Deepa  Dougal,  as part of her MSc
project, carried out the task of looking up all the words from the LOB
Corpus in CUV2.

Archive,   so   that   researchers   who   need   a  reasonably  large
computer-usable dictionary do not need to  spend  months,  as  I  did,
putting one together.  Anyone contemplating commercial use of the file
should contact the Oxford University Press.
