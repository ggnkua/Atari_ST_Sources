**      Rules are made up of four parts:
**
**              The left context.
**              The text to match.
**              The right context.
**              The phonemes to substitute for the matched text.
**
**      Procedure:
**
**              Seperate each block of letters (apostrophes included)
**              and add a space on each side.  For each unmatched
**              letter in the word, look through the rules where the
**              text to match starts with the letter in the word.  If
**              the text to match is found and the right and left
**              context patterns also match, output the phonemes for
**              that rule and skip to the next unmatched letter.
**
**
**      Special Context Symbols:
**
**              #       One or more vowels
**              :       Zero or more consonants
**              ^       One consonant.
**              .       One of B, D, V, G, J, L, M, N, R, W or Z (voiced
**                      consonants)
**              %       One of ER, E, ES, ED, ING, ELY (a suffix)
**                      (Found in right context only)
**              +       One of E, I or Y (a "front" vowel)
