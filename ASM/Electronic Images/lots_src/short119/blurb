Shorten is a fast, flexible compressor for waveform files (such as audio
data) that operates from compression rates from lossless coding down to
three bits per sample.

Shorten will provide better compression than general utilities (such as
those based on LZW coding) through exploitation of the structure in the
waveform.  It is also more flexible than compressors that have been
designed for telephony standards, such as ADPCM, which are designed to
work at a fixed bit rate with minimal delay.  By adpoting short-time
windowing techniques and variable bit rate allocation shorten can
operate anywhere from lossless coding down to a maximum compression of
16:3 (i.e. three bits per sample for 16 bit samples).

The current release, 1.19 is also an alpha release for format version 2.
This provides improved support for lossy compression, support for ulaw
encoded files, better compression for non-zero mean files, and
specification of the minimum acceptable signal to noise ratio.

Shorten is free provided you don't want to make money from it - if you
do then commercial licenses may be negotiated.
