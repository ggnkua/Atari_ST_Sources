Building shorten
================

There is no configuration file for this package, just type make to get
a single executable called "shorten".  The make variables CC and
CFLAGS can be set if so desired.  The default is to assume that you
have gcc, make and sh installed, (like I have under MSDOS and many
UNIX implementations).  If you don't have GCC you should use:

	make CC=cc CFLAGS=-O

The use of gcc is recommended, on a SparcStation the execution time is
reduced by about 25% as compared with the unbundled cc.

Testing shorten
===============

A quick test may be performed with:

	make test

Installing shorten
==================

For a standard system:

	make install

will place shorten in /usr/local/bin and shorten.1 in /usr/local/man/man1.

The make variables prefix and maxext can be set for non-standard
environments, for example:

	make prefix=$HOME maxext=l

Other documentation
===================

A more readable version of the UNIX man page is contained in shorten.man.

Eventually I'll write a tech report on this and include it with the
documentation.  There are many neat tricks employed so you might find
it interesting.

Current bugs
============

There are no known problems with this code.

The MSDOS version lacks the automatic generation of filenames, this is
not a bug due to the 8.3 naming convention but a `feature' of MSDOS.  If
you know of a good solution, please tell me.

If you have any problems, please tell me and I'll do my best to fix them.
