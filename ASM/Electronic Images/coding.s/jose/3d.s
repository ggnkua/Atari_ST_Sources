;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Darn!  There's summat odd about the offscreen check...  Hmmmm!
;
; Jose here...  Aha!  I took a leaf out of the new line clipper's book, and now
; the Z clipper is nice and short, and faster too!  It works the same way as
; the divide one, but none of that best maths crap now; instead it checks for
; the longest extent of the line past the Z clip plane - this way we have a clip
; as accurate as the normal way, and coherent (no breaks) still!  Wahey!!  Now
; it'll work REAL well in a cache (code needs changing for that though!!)!
;
; Yikes!!  Oops!  The horizon routine didn't have an RTS at the end of it
; (Agg!  Not *again*!!), so after slapping myself, I put it in!!  Argghhh!
; It fell through to the blitter routine!!  Aiiieee!
;
; Well, I put in Z clip smoothing in...  It's not THAT smooth but at least it
; stops the polygons from 'disjointing' from their original shape.  It is a
; scale less (*2) than maximum just in case there are bigger objects...
;
; Cap'n Smoothe on the case!  Aharr!  After the colossal battle between The
; Jerkman and I, he was defeated after successive 32-bit-divide blows!  (Takes
; pill)  Right, after a while I put in 32 bit divides (oh well...) in the
; horizon routine to calculate the perspective.  This means that the line
; coordinates for the horizon can be huge (+-7000 now), making it loads smoother
; although being about twice as slow (sigh); that's negligible since it only
; replaced a normal perspective divide thingie anyway!!  There's a few things
; I should clear though...  It has lots of Easy Rider 'L000' labels.  This is
; because (look at the length of the code!) I saved typing time by doing the
; routine in Devpac3 using macros, then disassembling the code!!  I did the
; same with Russ's polyclipper, as it saved re-naming the labels (Turbo doesn't
; support local labels...  Sigh...).  Now, the routine does the 32 bit divide
; (which caters for overflow!) for the perspective, yielding massive values for
; low Z values; it therefore has to scale them to within 32768 for the clipper
; to handle.  Oh, and it uses unsigned values for greater accuracy.
; That's it!  JoSe.
;
; Jose yet again...  Err now uses a 32 bit coordinate system!  It only considers
; drawing objects if they are within 16 bits (rotation limitations), and anyway,
; they'd be too small to see anyway!  As Marty poos said, I got to speed up the
; object-in-range check thingie, since it does quite a few checks now...
;
; Thigh and buttock!  A little 'problem' I found in the raster convert needs
; solving and making the horizon smoother...
;
; Jose again...  I looked at Russ's poly clipper for the rounding lark, and
; saw a 'best maths' method where it uses the greatest length for the
; calculations (bloody obvious when you look at it!!), and thus that does the
; 'rounding' for the Z clipper!  Wahey!
;
; Jose 'there's always a bug' McThigh here...
; Right, finally I get to write something!!  After a few (!) changes I split the
; data tables for the routines so now they are included with the routines so
; there's no need to look for that buggering polygon filler table all over the
; place; it's now with the polygon filler - the same goes for all the other
; routines.  Contrary to what was expected, it actually comes out slightly
; slower since some routines need a JSR now!  Waaaah!  I also changed the Z
; clipper so it uses similar triangles instead of midpoint subdivision - it's
; faster, seems to jitter less (!!) and it's for post-paranoid programmers - i.e
; it won't lock up if you fuck up (slogan #2, available in record shops).  There
; is *one* downside, in that the roundoff errors rear their ugly head, resulting
; in polygons sharing the same point 'splitting' from each other...  Ah well...
; Err, what's more...  Ah yes, I put in a road flag so it forces whatever to the
; first sort position; I might change it so you can include *what* sort position
; you want...  May be handy for going inside buildings..?  Because of the bloody
; clockwise checker which gets 'confused' at the 0 boundary, I put in a 'face
; adjust' value - you can tweak a face so that it can be visible from a distance
; or completely flat - nice for roads and shadows!
;  There's now the (trumpet salute) HORIZON ROUTINE included!  It's bloody fast,
; works with anything and is a fucking massive piece of code to do fuck all!
; Ben suggested I fill the insides of the horizon 'triangle' with MOVEM's...  To
; make that work faster than the poly filler added 25K of thunderingly fast code
; that sometimes causes interference on the radio!  Sigh...  I still have the
; version which calls the poly filler for the triangle bit...  Who knows if that
; is any faster on a cache (doubt it - well, hope not, cos this one was a right
; pain in the tits to code); one day I'll try it on oz's 040!
;
; - Version Z4 -
;
; Jose again!  Err, sped up the line clipper a bit so it uses the carry bit
; to determine wether a line is out (it subtracts the clip boundaries, then does
; a ROXL to obtain wether it was in/out!) - it doesn't use a CMP and BGE, so
; making it about 4 cycles faster per bound check.  I got the idea from the book
; 'Computer Graphics - Principles and Practice' - I might have done it before,
; but I forgot that a SUB instruction affects the carry/extend bit!!  Sigh...
; Right, I also commented the circle manager and circle generator, as I meant to
; do when I wrote it!  MooooOOO...
;
; Just a note...  If the Hither value is a power of 2 (2,4,8,16,32,64...) then
; the Z clipper can be sped up by quite a bit per clipped point.  Since Z is
; constant at the clipped plane, there's no need to do DIVS's after the ASLs #8;
; e.g. we need only use (in the case of Hither=64) an ASL #2, and no divides!
; Jose (still fighting with the horizon!).
;
; Phew!  At the request of Ben (and I wanted it too!) I re-vamped the way the
; objects are handled etc. thus saving space and unnecessary data copying, so
; it is faster too!  Object data definitions now only have a width to them,
; since it did not need the object's XYZ position or angle because the object
; list contained that information!  Instead of JUST having the width defined
; (apart from point and polygon data that is!) I left 8 bytes of reserved space
; for future expansion (8-view, ground/air object etc etc).  It is now simpler
; to access an object's view-rotated position; instead of waiting it to be drawn
; all you have to do is look at the oblist (note the missing obx,oby,obz...).
; Also (cor! more!) I thought I might as well extend the Z clipper flag - it now
; is OBJECT_FLAG, with bit 0 (of a 16-bit number) signifying if a Z clip is
; needed or not.  I did this so we can chuck in anything that comes to mind,
; like using the screen bound check to see if the object is 'on target' etc!
; Last, but not least, I threw Russ's treesort away, and replaced it with a
; faster quicksort routine (it uses loads less memory too!), which can be VERY
; easily expanded to use 32-bit numbers!  Waheyy!  It was quite a big change
; (sure bloody was!), but again, worth it!
; Jose.
;
; - Version Z3 -
;
; (To avoid confusion, from now on, anything above 'Version xx' will be the
; relevant information to that version, not below!  That's from above onwards!)
;
;
; Overflow checks on object position are now in operation!!  Now there's no
; duff mirror image objects due to overflow on large distances (since 32767
; * 3 and then a X2 for quick divide down will overflow it!!!).  It is now
; quicker too since the dummy adds have been removed since there are now two
; separate rotate routines.
;
; Err, fixed the raster convertor...  Removed the subq.w #1,poly_height...  Was
; a remnant from a change a while ago...
;
; Bugger, I forgot to mention it!  It had for some time (I think on the Zn ones)
; the (new) lightsource routine...  Ben improved it and it's bloody fast (9 muls
; and a divide per face!!!) and ONLY calculates lightsourcing on visible polys
; (the golden peanut runs about 50% faster now!!).  It also doesn't fuck up when
; the object moves from 0,0,0 (!!).  Objects have an extra value per face
; determining the lightsource range (the same value used for circle widths,
; since circles can't be lightsourced) which gets added on to the colour...  So
; we can have any number of shades for any face, all independent of each other!
; To speed things up, the lightsource range is an inverse multiply, so instead
; of a value of 10, it's 65535/10.
; Wheee!
;
; Has the 'new' camera routine with the 3-divide square root!  Note that it has
; to be ranged to a smaller triangle since the approximation of the root uses a
; 2^n calculation, so triangulation must occur sooner...  Still, 3 divides and
; just as accurate as the other one!  Old camera routine is OLDCAM.S in case...
;
; Jose here...  Changed the midpoint subdivision in the Z clipper to use WORD
; values, making it about 50% faster.
;
; Yikes!  BIIIIIGGG bug!  I (Jose) left...  Errr...  Umm...  A little typing
; error which meant that the (individual) object rotations were wrong!!  I also
; took out an unnecessary bit as well (2 lines!)...  Well it works now!!  Well,
; anyway, it means that if someone DID steal the source, they have a dodgy one!
;
; Improved camera routine!!
;
; Version 2W (more advanced than the Zn series (that sounded a bit techy!!)):
;
; Oh, it seems the raster converter is slightly inaccurate...  I dunno but it
; seems the last line (sometimes) is wrong...!!!!  It never gets displayed, but
; I dunno...
;
; Oops!  Jose here...  Removed a little 'bug' - the raster converter subroutine
; did not have an RTS at the end of it thus filling TWO polys!!!  Agg!  It now
; runs twice as fast!!!   Oh, also idividual object rotations now work!!
;
;
; Jose here, REALLY pleased and happy and all fluffy and wonderful!!!
;  Well, I said 'Ben, it's not that hard!' (oo-er) to do a world-movement system
; and it wasn't!!!  Well, first, here's what this version has...
;
; Full world coordinate system with sorting.
; Camera routine (optional) with looking from-looking at calculations (that's
; Ben Griffin there, coo!).
; Full world movement with virtual from-to movement (ha!)!
;
;  Well, here's how the movement system works (Ben, if you're reading this, it
; was just as I said, and it doesn't even need the camera routine!!!):
; The mouse, as usual, changes the viewer's X and Y angle.  Well, somewhere in
; memory we have a line from 0,0,0 to 0,0,1000 (looking forward).  The line end
; (the 0,0,1000) gets rotated according to these angles.  Since the line's
; origin is always 0,0,0, we need not store this, or include the origin in the
; delta calculations, since subtractiong 0 always is useless!  Then we find out
; the slope of the line in both X,Y and Z.  Now, when we 'move' these slope
; values get added to our viewer position in the X Y and Z.  The line where we
; calculate the slope from NEVER moves from the origin, it is just used for the
; slope, according to the view angles, and since we are taking the view angles
; directly to rotate the line, we don't need a camera routine, since we are
; moving the way we are facing.
;  Now, I did another version which takes an abolute view from the line, but
; this one is simpler + faster.  The other one what it did was basically the
; same thing, but passed on the line from (VIEWER POSITION) to (VIEWER POSITION
; + LENGTH OF (ROTATED) MOVEMENT LINE) to the camera routine.  Geddit?  So the
; camera routine would take our XYZ position and where we are going to and
; return the appropiate viewer angles.  This means that the mouse had to alter
; the movement line's angles, not the viewer's ones (as the camera routine would
; have to tell us those!).  Phew!  Anyway it works fantastic, and if Ben is
; reading this, I'll just say that I'm glad I did it for you!!!
;
;
; (Jose) Took out the keyboard 'bug' in the mouse handler.
;
; Jose here...  Right!  After bloody millenia I've put in:
; A line drawer (almost - still have to finish it!).
; A fully-clipped-and-all-the-trimmings circle generator!!!
; And I split the polygon filler and raster convert and some other things so
; it's easier to change (say, to another rez or 'pooter) to subroutines.
; Russ's polygon clipper, and indeed, the circle generator, take the clipping
; coordinates from the line drawer window.  Unfortunately I think Russ's clipper
; can't clip to top or left window coords (I mean, apart from zero!), but now
; it uses the other coords anyway!!
; WARNING!!  I made a bloody cheat since the circle clipper was getting on my
; tits and I sort-of went chicken!  Because of the case of the left and right
; sides being partially outside of the window (e.g. a pot-belly sticking out
; from the side of the screen!) I had two choices:  clip the bugger while
; generating it, or ignore it and be naughty and extend the line filler table
; so that the out-of screen coordinates are in reverse, thus self-clipping
; the circle!!  Now, I'm not sure if it is actually quicker or not (I have
; a feeling it's quicker if it's in the circle generator...), but after my
; hair stood on end when watching those cycles fly past...  Err...  Mebbe I
; should do half-tables...  Hmmm!  Actually, on second thought, (this is 1
; minute after saving this!) that'll REALLY slow it down because of the Y
; clipping, since you'd have to include it for every point...  And if Martin is
; reading this, I'm *NOT* making a huge jump table!  You'll see why!!
;
; Jose here...  Agg!  Ben found out a REAL big bug that was a consequence of the
; viewer/object rotation modifications.  He noticed that I was re-calculating
; perspective every time a new poly used a similar corner!!  Example...  It
; would do an extra 4 divides PER CORNER on a cube, since the adjacent polygons
; were using the same adjacent vertices!  Agggg!  Well, now it's solved!  It's a
; tiny piece of code (about 10 lines); I think I'll try and attempt the same for
; the Z clipper...
;
; Jose here...  Solved the crappy X and Y screen boundary checks...  Only
; an extra 30 cycles methinks on worst case.  Mind you, you can restore it
; to the normal checks so that the 'bug' is used so that when half of the object
; goes by, it rejects it (*NOT* recommended on roads!)!!
;
; Version Z8:
;
;  I put in frame-compensation under mouse control and NO divides or multiplies
; to get frame compensated value (has the restriction that your incremental
; value cannot be bigger than 255, and delay between frames is no longer than
; 10...  As in every 1/5 of a second (0.2)).
;  I also put in combined viewer/object rotation!  Object structure has a new
; value at offset +14.  It is OBJECT FLAGS.  Current flags are:
; Bit 0 : Set if object has own rotation.  Not set if non-rotatable.  This saves
; on about 27 multiplies (or more I think!) per object (NOT point!) since view
; matrices and object matrices are not combined when object is non-rotatable.
; Because of the view rotation, Z clip and screen boundary checks have to take
; the object's X,Y,Z position (in object structure) and rotate it.  The rotated
; point is stored independently as the rotated X,Y,Z coordinates so as not to
; alter the object's position.  This way we know the object's position after
; view rotation (otherwise checks would fail as the actual 'object' has no
; position in itself).
;  I'm still waiting for ben's B-Splines and see if we can make objects with
; them since there is no rotation involved apart from the control points!  Also
; I am waiting for the de-bugged lightsource (Ben again!) since the old one only
; worked properly if the object was at origin 0,0,n.  Also I'll edit this soon
; enough so as to include line drawing (with the new cooey line drawer!).  Must
; remind myself that I gotta use the modified Z clipper in me file BIGRLTS2.
;
;
; Versions Z7 and below, below!  Err Jose here this was 'old' commenting!
;
; Phew!  Solved the backface removal 'bug' on the Z clipper; now I re-center
; the Z rotation around origin 0 not the current Z value (huh?)!!
;
; Hmm...  I put in a face check in the Z clipper, so it does NOT clip the
; faces that are not visible.  The downside of this is that zclipped faces
; take 3 scanlines more (6 divides and two multiplies extra)...  Hmm may be
; time to use table perspective!!!  The good thang is that half the object is
; not zclipped (which takes about 8 screenlies per face!!!).  Ooh!
; Oh, watch out with divisions by zero on the zclip face check.
;
; Changed the Z clipper and Zclip rotation output so it handles 'standard'
; lists of X,Y,Z...  Still the same speed though!
;
; Right...  Found the 'bug' in the Z clipper.  Actually the Z clipper is perfect
; and works exactly as it should.  It is only when two similar points lie on a
; plane that it does the 'flicker'.  This is due to the CLOCKWISE CHECKER (not
; the Z clipper) working on the small differences involved.  This is too small
; on near ranges, but if a flicker-free clockwise check is needed (when the
; hither plane is about >1000) then scale up the resulting coordinates and make
; sure they are put back to normal AFTER the clockwise check!!
;
; Now has the faster Z clipper - it's rather longer than the old one, but thanks
; to the 'part' thingie I just found out it doesn't get in the way too much now!
; The fully commented Z clipper is ZCLIP.S.
;
; Oops!  Removed a slight bug in the hash filler...  The odd error lines that
; I noticed are now gone!!
;
; Hmm...  Martin's Hline thingie...  It's 4 cycles faster on >1 chunk hlines,
; but 4 cycles slower on <1 chunk hlines!  Hmm...  So I dunno...  Which are
; drawn more?
;
; For even MORE code the hash line filler is now 8 cycles faster per scanline.
;
; Now with a sliightly faster matrix generator...  Might as well!
; Can gain an extra 4 cycles per scaledown by replacing:
; ADD.L Dn,Dn
; SWAP Dn
; By:
; SWAP Dn
; ADD.W Dn,Dn
; But I left it out since you lose one bit accuracy, and since it's not very
; much difference, I thought I'd have 36 cycles more per update than lose one
; bit accuracy.  Mind you, when you have about 8+ objects to display, then do
; the above, then it will be worth it!
;
; Now with hash filling!!!  FULL hash filling!  It is about 15-20% slower than
; the normal fill, due to the way you have to mask the bugger!  There are TWO
; hash definitions, even though you can rotate the first line's hash to get
; the second, I did two hash definitions since that allows you to have different
; types of patterns (even though they are 2 pixels high).  Hashes are defined
; from colour 16 (inclusive) onwards...
;
; Now with side edge tests - it discards the object if it is not within the
; viewer's window.  Checking is done BEFORE Z check.
;
; Now with frame compensation (using timer D mind!).
;
; Now with full Z clip tests...  Doesn't do the time consuming Z clipping
; calculations when the object is either in front or behind the clip window.
; If it is behind the window (totally invisible) it doesn't even bother
; rotating the object etc etc!
; Also does the yonder plane...  Does not zclip the object, but just makes
; it disappear.
;
; I now have the object's XYZ position, width and angle of rotation in the
; object data itself...
;
; Call me 'length'!!  I had to knock out the *4 thing in the coordinate
; calculations, slowing the hline by 8 cycles (waah!).  So I thought (hah!),
; "Why not do *4 in the raster convert?"  So I did - no overflow probs etc
; and it's now back to its normal, lightning speed!
;
; Removed the additional Zbuffer space so now it only copies twice instead
; of three times.
;
; Zclip still needs optimizing (I did a bit of it though!)...  I need macros!
;
; To avoid a Zclip test on eveything it's best to put in the object's XYZ world
; coordinates and its width somewhere...
;
; Solved the 'problem' in the Zclip - oops!  I was putting in a WORD destination
; value when I should have used a longword hither...  That meant that the upper
; word of D0 could have contained anything!
; It's a 32-bit midpoint because if you do 32767+32767 then you'd overflow, and
; 32767 is the max coordinates an object can reach!
;
; NOW WITH Z CLIPPING!  (Puff puff, hard work!)  Needs optimizing!
;
; Solid 3D (this one 8 cycles faster per hline using a really neat idea
; by Russ to make X be multiples of 4!)
;
; Made a bit faster by me changing the right edge Y to a negated screen
; chunk, so it jumps back through the drawer table.
;
; This one using Martin's ADDX way to get the gradients.  Slightly faster
; but it took me a whole fucking day to get it working using 8 registers
; U BASTARD Martin I'm going to killlll youuuuu.
;
; All code by Jose Miguel Commins, but I must add that it wouldn't be so
; fast so soon if it weren't for these luvly peepl who pooled ideas:
; Russ Payne and Martin Griffiths.  Where it's due:
; Russ: *4 technique and 'copy branch back' bit in line filler.
; Also the saving a BRA cont in the line filler (12 cycles).
; Martin: ADDX gradient calculations and (without him realising it worked)
; the single MULS way to get the gradient int and frac bits.
;
; So really, this is the fruit of our combined loins! (disgusting)
;
; Using Russ's polyclipper, which only clips the bits that are off the
; edges - but you need to scan for the MaxX MinX MinY Maxy of the object.
;
; Added the 'missing line' on the raster convert.
;
; Changed the coordinate duplication to where it checks for maximum Y
; so it's a bit faster (Martin's suggestion).
;
; I relocated the chunk 1 routine saving a last BRA and now on big polys
; it falls through on conditional branches saving umm 8 cycles me thinks!
;
; Polygon raster convert now much simpler and faster too since it does
; the two edges separately, not needing to check for manky edges!
; Martin said he uses it, and I saw the light - coo!
;
; After many hours of sweat and tears (sob!), Russ and I concluded that
; the ADDX.L way of getting the gradient is too dodgy since it overflows
; and corrupts the values easily, plus in certain cases it completely
; negates a zero value when it should stay the same.  So we stick to normal
; ADD.W and ADDX.W.
;
; Umm added extra space for the line edges tables because otherwise the
; first would overwrite the second!

; Z clipper routine.  New and improved, it is greener and uses less of the

; clipped coordinates!  Nowadays I've been thinking of other processors (030 and
; 040) that have divides of 20 cycles (for 030) and 1 (for 040!!), which means
; that the midpoint subdivision routine is slower, since it will execute more
; instructions (loads more) and there's no more advantage over the divide (which
; takes a bloody 140 cycles on a 68000!!).  Even now, I think this way is faster
; than the midpoint!!  It seems more colinear too, resulting in less jitter; it
; is now impossible to lock the machine (since there's no midpoint routine to
; search for a number it can't find!), so there you go!
