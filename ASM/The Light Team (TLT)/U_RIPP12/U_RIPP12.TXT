Hiya dudez...... This is Zaphod Beeblebrox on the keyboard!!!!! This
Ultimate Ripper eprom file was brought to you by The Light Team (TLT).
Some useful information: When you are going to use this file, burn it
into 2 ordinary 27256 32 Kbyte eproms and put them on a catridge board.
When you want to use The Ultimate Ripper, load the program you want to rip
from, and hold the reset button whilst inserting the cartridge into the
ST's cartridge port. (Ya can mount a switch on the +5V supply line to the
eproms and toggle that on/off instead if you're a bit more technically
minded!!!! Then when you have done that, release the reset button and
press F1 (Search for free RAM and enter Ultimate Ripper), or F2 (You
choose RAM to be sacrificed), or F7 (The ST will reboot, and if you
connect a switch between PIN 20 and 22 in the RS232 port ya can freeze
some games/programs and enter the Ultimate Ripper and restart them!!).
There might be more F key combinations that I don't know about yet, but
all you have to do is to experimint around!!! If ya don't have an eprom
burner, I can burn the eprom chips for a small fee..... Contact me or
someone else in The Light Team at Frontier BBS in Uppsala, Sweden. 
Phone number: +46 18 241690..... 300/1200/2400 Baud, 8N1......

Greetz, Zaphod Beeblebrox "Beeblebrox Industries Unlimited"/TLT.

P.S
If ya want any other exotic hardware like trackdisplays and such stuff
 - contact me, I can build most kinda stuff.... And be sure to look out
for more TLT products - perfection is the only acceptable standard!!
