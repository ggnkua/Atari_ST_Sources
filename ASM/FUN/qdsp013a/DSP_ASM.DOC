
-- Quick DSP assembler --   v0.06     (21.10.1995)

by Audoly Gilles


This program was done because the assembler given by ATARI is too slow.
As nobody else tried to make one in assembly, I did.
(well, the first version was avaible in november 1993 ...)
This assembler is nearly 30 times faster than ASM56000.TTP+DSPLNK+CLD2LOD.
It is 20 times smaller too, and my version isn't really 20 times lower.
Who said that assembly is useless, because C can do as good ?
The speed test was done with a complete 3000 lines source.

This program is not supposed to replace ASM56000.TTP coded in C by Motorola.
I don't know perfectly the  DSP. You must sometime assemble your program
with ASM56000, to check if mine didn't miss a bugg.

Please remember, that I'm not payed to do this job. I'm coding it anytime
I'm bored with my main programs (the serious ones). Then, you must excuse
the low quality of this program, and the time to wait for a new version.
This program was specially made for me, and my big dsp routine (3000 lines)
I'm working on. (Do you know what 5 minutes waiting means ?)





-- example --

_how to assemble:
open "qdsp_asm.ttp"
command line: "file.asm"

_how to use it:
	...
	...
	...
Dsp_ExecProg: MACRO		;#codeptr.L,#codesize.L,#ability.W
	move.w	\3,-(sp)
	move.l	\2,-(sp)
	move.l	\1,-(sp)
	move.w	#$6d,-(sp)
	trap	#14
	lea.l	12(sp),sp
	ENDM
	...
	...
	...
	Dsp_ExecProg	#buff,#(ebuff-bbuff)/3,#ability
	...
	...
	...
bbuff: incbin "file.p56"
ebuff:
	...
	...


in C: load it somewhere, get the file size, and execute Dsp_ExecProg.

You can use the ".lod" too, but I think the ".p56" is better, because it
is smaller, and it will remain less time to execute. I think you should
include in your programs, the possibility of loading ".dsp". For example:
in dsp sound effects programs.
".lod" can be translated to ".p56" with the Dsp_LodToBinary function.



command line syntax:
[n] [l] [w] [oFILE.P56] [pFILE] FILE.ASM

example:
l otest.p56 test.asm

n:        won't create '.P56' output file
l:        make a LOD output file too
oFILE.P56 define an other name for output file (don't forget the extention)
w:        wait for additional keypress


restrictions:
 _ warnings are not reported. (not even counted).
 _ few assembling directives.
 _ no optimisation directives.
 _ ALL THE RESTRICTIONS WRITTEN IN THE DSP MANUAL ARE NOT SEEN BY THE
   ASSEMBLER !! (ex1: short jsr at LA adress  ex2:rti after rep
                 EX3: use of Rn after move ??,Rn ...).
 _ please don't make mistake on command line.

If you find a bugg I didn't register, it would be nice to report it.


notes:
 _ "_label" is a local label.
 _ labels may be defined many times. (main reason of hard debugging !)



**** v0.02 improvements:

 _ double parallel move.

 _ L: memory move is now allowed.

 _ brackets in arithmetic.

 _ MACROs without parameters.
   "__label" is a macro local label.

   ex:

   mac1:  MACRO
          cmp  a,b
          jeq  __lab0
          not  a
          jmp  __lab1
   __lab0:
          not  b
   __lab1:
          ENDM

          mac1
          ...
          mac1
          ...
          ...



**** v0.03 improvement:

_ some buggs have been fixed.



**** v0.04 improvements:

_ ".P56" extension is now use instead of ".DSP", as devpac dsp (and maybe
others) created this normalisation.

_ bugg about use of recursive brackets is fixed. (and others, I haven't
enumerated, too.)

_ assembling directives.
 IF,IFNE,IFEQ,IFLE,IFLT,IFGE,IFGT,ELSE/ELSEIF,ENDC/ENDIF

_ macro WITH parameters
ex:
      ...
      ...
test: MACRO
      add    \2,\1
      movep  \1,X:<<HTX
      ENDM
      ...
      ...
      test   a,b




**** v0.05 improvement:

_ some buggs have been fixed.




**** v0.06 improvements:

_ some buggs have been fixed.

_ PRINTVAL value
   will print a value, while assembling, on pass 1 and pass 2. The value can
   be a any kind of arithmetix expression, with numbers and variables.

_ PASS1VAL value
  PASS2VAL value
   will do the same as PRINTVAL, but only on pass1 or pass2

_ FAIL [message]
   will display unconditionaly an error message. (you should use it with IFxx)

_ <<, >>
   logical shift in arithmetic.
   eg: 5<<6 = 5*2^6 = 320
       40>>3 = 40/2^3 = 5

_ fractional in arithmetic.
   convert your fractionnal in the dsp format. your number is a fractionnal
   if it starts with "0." or ".".
   warning: you can't multiply 2 fractionals.
   eg: 0.5*0.5<>0.25    0.5*0.5=$400000*$400000= ?
   if you want to do so, you'll have to divide by $800000 (+1.0, but not
   reconized under this form by the assembler)
   eg: to multiply 0.5 by 0.5, you'll have to do: 0.5*0.5/$80000
   waring 2: you can't divide 2 fractionals.
   if you want to do so, you'll have to multiply by $800000
   eg: to divide 0.1 by 0.5, you'll have to do: 0.1*$800000/0.5




Note about "<" and ">":
Please always use ">" and "<" each time you use a constant.
When you don't put it, the program take it for immediate short ("<") if the
value is lower than the address where you put it (for jumps), and lower than
$1000. It would be considered as absolute immediate (">"), if the adress is
greater. Then, you should always use "<", and change it to ">" if the value
is too big.
I ask you to always use them, because, I'm not sure if I solved all the
problems that may appen.





If you're ATARI developper, you can get the source of this stuff.
The price : any nice source coded by you.


For this job, I only expect gratitude, or donation IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO
WASTE.


To copy this program, you should keep those points:
_ Nothing can be modified (text file, text in the program, ...)
_ This text file must be given with the program.
_ No kind of profit allowed. (If you wish to, you'll have to deal with me.)
