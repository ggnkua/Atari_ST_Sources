Many DSP56001 designs require that the target hardware boot from an external
byte-wide EPROM. Often, getting the user's code into bootable form raises  
questions regarding the use of overlay addresses (i.e., separate runtime
and loadtime address counters) and the generation of files in formats
which will be accepted by standard EPROM programming equipment.



** DSP56001 bootstrap operation **

Upon leaving reset, the DSP56001 samples the MODA/IRQA and MODB/IRQB pins
in order to determine the initial operating mode. If MODA/IRQA is at a 
logic "1" and MODB/IRQB is at a logic "0", the device will enter the 
bootstrap mode and will then sample Data Bit 23 at address P:$C000. If this
bit is read as a logic "0", the bootstrap process will expect to receive
code through the Host Interface of the DSP56001.  If this bit is sensed
as a logic "1", then the device will load its initial operating instructions
from byte-wide memory located on the external data bus.

When booting from external byte-wide memory, the DSP56001 first retrieves 
the data on bits 0-7 of the external data bus at address P:$C000. This byte 
is assumed to be the low byte of a 24-bit word. The bytes at P:$C001 and 
P:$C002 are then read and assumed to be the middle and upper bytes 
(respectively) of the first 24-bit instruction word. The first 24-bit 
instruction word is then constructed from these 3 bytes and placed into 
on-chip Program Memory at address p:0000.  
The next 3 bytes read from the EPROM at P:$C003, P:$C004
and P:$C005 are used to construct the instruction word which is placed into
on-chip Program memory at P:0001.  This process continues until the entire
512 words of internal Program Memory are filled from EPROM data. When this
on-chip program memory has been loaded, the DSP56001 starts executing code
at P:0000.  It is crucial that the module be written such that orderly
execution begins at this address, P:0000, the Reset Vector.


*** a simple example ***

A simple example will serve as our vehicle for demonstrating the steps 
necessary to generate a bootable EPROM.  The entire code module for this 
example appears boot.asm.  The main task of this module is to toggle 
the LSB of Port-C so that the user may confirm proper boot operation 
through an oscilloscope attached to that I/O pin. This simplistic piece
of code would normally contain the user's application or a more 
sophisticated loader which would initialize external X:, Y; and/or P:
memory from a different portion of the EPROM.

The ORG directive merits discussion.  In particular, the second ORG
directive uses some interesting techniques.  In this case, we need to assemble
code which will EXECUTE in P:memory at  an address referred to by the
symbol "main".  This symbol has been previously set to the value $50, so
this code will be assembled to start at P:$0050.  The EPROM which contains
the program will be mapped into the DSP56001's Program Memory at P:$C000, due
to the dictates of the device bootstrap procedure.  This dilemma is solved
through the second portion of the ORG directive where a loadtime address is
specified.  

Recall that the EPROM is a byte-wide device and requires three
sequential addresses for each 24-bit word stored in this non-volatile device.
The second element in the ORG directive is an expression which computes the
appropriate EPROM address for this portion of the code.  This expression 
starts by multiplying the beginning address of this segment of code by 3.
This compensates for the fact that 3 addresses were occupied for each single
24-bit word located in EPROM.  Additionally, the EPROM begginning address
of $C000 was added to this product in order to offset the addresses as 
required by the EPROM mapping.

At this point, the assembler has been directed to generate code for execution 
at P:$0050 but the actual addresses sent to the load file start at p:$C0F0. 
This is the proper address for the first byte (the lower byte...) which will
used to construct the 24-bit word destined for P:$0050 in the DSP56001's
on-chip P:RAM.  

A simple warning message is conditionally assembled in the event that
the user's code size exceeds the amount of P:RAM on-chip. This may be
particularly helpful during code development where code size is continuously
being altered. 


**** the interrupt vector table ****

The first $40 locations of DSP56001 on-chip P:memory are used for interrupt
vectors.  It is a good practice to initialize these locations in such a 
manner as to gracefully accomodate unexpected interrupts. Since booting the 
DSP56001 from EPROM will always fill these locations, initializing the
vectors has no effect on the boot timing.  Perhaps the easiest way to
accomplish this initialization is the fill the vectors with NOPs as is
shown in the example. As a minimum, this technique reduces unexpected
interrupts to Fast Interrupts in which two NOPs are executed and the machine
returns to the normal execution stream. The disadvantage of the approach is
that the errant behavior will add a slight delay to the execution of the main
program while the Fast Interrupt is serviced.


*** making a EPROM programmer compatible file ***

The program can be assembled with a single command line as follows:

        asm56000 -a -b -l boot

This produces a listing file (boot.lst) as well as the  load file boot.lod.
If you are using version 4 or later of the Assembler/Linker, you will need to
use the CLDLOD utility to convert the file to a .LOD file; CLDLOD is
available for download in "software/tools."

The utility SREC can be used to generate S-RECORD formatted output files which
are used by most standard EPROM programming hardware. The following command
line will generate a single S-RECORD file (boot.p) which will be ready
to send to the EPROM programmer:

        srec boot

The output file from this utility is an ASCII file (S-RECORDS are ASCII).
Note that after the standared S-record preamble 
information (including the EPROM address), the data is presented in the 
order of least-, middle- and then most-significant byte.  This is the 
proper order for the bootstrap process on the DSP56001.  Note that the
next-to-last record in boot.p points to address $C0F0, an address which is
NOT contiguous with the previous records.  The code has specified that
NOPs are to be place in the first $40 address, but then the next segment of
code is to be placed in a different portion of the EPROM. The contents of 
the addresses which occur between the end of the first segment and the start
of the second segment of code will NOT be programmed and will generally
contain $FF - the default value for non-programmed (i.e., erased) EPROM bits.
