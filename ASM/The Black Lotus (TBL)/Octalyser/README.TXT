Well, here's the source code for Octalyser 0.96.
This piece is over 30 years old, see date 940731 in the code :-).

This is built with DevPac3.10.

Hope you find it useful, it's one single .S file for the whole program,
making it load and assemble quickly. Use it as you'd like, maybe
add that sample editor? Or use the playroutine in your own project?

Most comments and labels in the code are in Swedish.

Thanks Tord for reaching out, and for keeping the source all this time!
The already compiled version is available under New Core.


Best wishes,
