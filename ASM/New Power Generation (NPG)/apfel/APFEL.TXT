This archive should contain:
1. A Fractal Zoomer (+Sourcecode)
2. My old Wolfenstein DSP Routine (DSP-Sourcecode)
3. A nice graphic effect programm


1. The little fractal zoomer.

Coded by Roland Spatzenegger.

I started coding this routine about 1 year ago, but it didn't worked,
because I didn't know how the Scaling mode of the DSP worked ;)
Yesterday I found this routine and finished it.

Oh I forgot to write how this program works ....

Double click on APFEL2B.PRG. After a short time, the Mandelbrot-Set
will be displayed in 640x480x256.
Know the keys to go on:
SPACE	|Leave program
ESC	|repaint picture.
F1	|zoom in the upper left half of the screen
F2	|zoom in the upper right half of the screen
F3	|zoom in the lower left half of the screen
F4	|zoom in the upper right half of the screen
or simple:
-------
|F1|F2|
|-----|	   <-screen
|F3|F4|
-------

I have included the 68030 Source code (it's written in Devpac 3),
and the DSP code ...


Thats all, folks,
if I have more time I will add a GEM-window, a save routine, BlowUP resolutions,
virtuell screen resolution.....
(or perhaps someone else wants to make it ???)

To render all parts of the fractal at maximum depth you need >60 years ;-)
Happy zooming!
