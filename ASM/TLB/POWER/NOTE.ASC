BUDGIE UK licenceware (C) LOST BOYS 1989, 1990.


The Megabang  and  Power demos are two early pieces from the Lost Boys.
The source code on this disk is a powerful tool for learning the 
art of writing demos in machine language.

Needless to say, a good assembler is required. And there is none better
than Devpac2. One meg of ram is also a useful environment for
generating hassle-free code.

You should reserve a text buffer of at least 300K (see Devpac preferences)
Assembling the Power demo to memory is likely to cause memory problems.
Therefore you should assemble both these demos to disk.
The problem is that both source and object code will need disk space.
GenST2 (the assembler) will also have to be on disk.
The answer therefore is to format TWO disks (80 tracks/10 sectors/2 sides)
Then copy all the Megabang files onto one disk, with GenST.
Do the same with Power demo on the other disk.
Both disks will have enough spare space to accept the object code (PRG)

Please note that the Megabang demo source code is symbol independent
whereas the Power demo is not.

The Power demo will assemble to 247961 bytes
The Megabang will yield 53027 bytes.

The Power demo is fairly self-contained. The Megabang on the other hand,
loads several files. The Mega.prg should therefore be within the same
folder as its files if it is to run properly. The Megabang will actually
compile to memory on a 1 meg machine.

The Lost Boys have also made available the source code to some more 
recent demos, Definitive and parts of Mindbomb being some of them.
But they may not necessarily assemble to an executable program.
Budgie will carry these sources if and when executable object code
is achievable. The reason why the DEFINITIVE source code does not
assemble is because music files which are commercial copyright had
to be deleted.
