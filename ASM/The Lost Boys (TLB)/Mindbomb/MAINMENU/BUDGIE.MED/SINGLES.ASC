easy to play and contains many features that sets it apart from

BU 3 BLITZ III by Camy Maertens.
This is a bombing raid with a different scenario: three aircraft
fly in formation, all under joystick control.
The aim of the game is to destroy the city before too much altitude
is lost. With each bombing pass, the altitude drops inexorably.
On some versions a rewarding bonus screen appears after  each successful
mission. This is a classic revisited: it first appeared on the VIC 2O
in 1982.  Budgie UK have added a new twist with multiple aircraft and
variable height control.

tough wait until the PUZZLER reduces you to a nervous wreck !

BU 7 BALL ZONE by Ian Grainger  
An incredible Arkanoid type game, only better.
Needless to say, this game is mouse controlled and has many levels.
But the main attractions are the time counter which dramatically
increases the tension and, also, the reassuring presence of base line
tiles which will rescue you in desparate situations.
The score is based on the number of tiles and parasites destroyed and
on the time left at the end of each level. This is an absolute must for
your collection! The first ever Quality game written in HiSoft Basic.

your profits or ...losses.  Any open position carrying an
excessive loss is automatically stopped.
