PRO 2 THE BUDGIE UK PROGRAMMER'S LIBRARY  v. 43
Double-sided disk full of machine-code routines, used by Budgie programmers
to write their games. A working 'shell' example is supplied.
More than 85 'basic-like' macros. Three years of developing and testing
went into this collection. Subjects covered are sprites, screen handling,
disk operations, interrupts, fonts, sound, scrolling, mouse and
joystick handling, etc... Updates are available at regular intervals.

PRO 3 SPRITE MASTER by Chris Skellern (single-sided)
A professional sprite editing package tailored to suit most programming
languages. Sprite sizes can be user-defined and stacked together to
create a multi-size output file. Complete with display routines and
restore buffers if required.  The disk contains the Editor program,
a short Demo game, example sprites, and a Neo-Sprite Master conversion kit.

A delight for the programmer or enthusiast.

PRO 7 MUZEXX MAKER (single-sided) by Malcolm Sparks
This music package is intended for the programmer wanting to write rhythms,
music and sound fx for games.. It outputs data to be loaded by a program

Addressing the YM 2149 sound chip is now a much easier task.
Generous examples and source codes are included.

PRO 12 BUDGIE'S ASTROLOGY by Andy Osborne and Danielle Le Marais
If you are one of those people who think that the horoscopes in the 
daily papers are a load of cobblers, we'd probably agree with you,
and instead suggest you look at this program. Using accurate scientific
data, it can calculate the exact position of the Sun, Moon and Planets
for any minute of any day past, present or future. Comprehensive
tutorials and exercises help to interpret this information and
produce a horoscope far more accurate than any newspaper column.

Tim Moss (Manikin of The Lost Boys) has at last agreed to release

50 frames a second!
