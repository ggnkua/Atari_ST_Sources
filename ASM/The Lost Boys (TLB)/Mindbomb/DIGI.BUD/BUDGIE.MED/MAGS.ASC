
MAG 1  ST-PLUG volume 12  April 1990  (d/sided)
The latest magazine on disk from North America.
ST-PLUG was originally conceived by Dan Panke as an on-line ST magazine.
Now at last available in disk form, it brings the latest news and
reviews from across the pond. In addition, utilities, accessories
and other useful programs are included in compressed, self-extracting
format. The in-built PERUSER allows ascii files and degas pictures
to be viewed together.

MAG 2  MAGGIE 1.0  by The Lost Boys  May 1990 (d/sided)
The zaniest disk magazine around! And it's from The Lost Boys, of course.
Humour, news, hot gossip, extraordinary built-in demos, tips,
programming in GFA, interviews with Bob Hay and other characters,
games and demos reviews. The style is totally unconventional. 
The effect is shattering.

MAG 3  ST-PLUG volume 13  June 1990  (d/sided)
More reviews and information from Dan Panke.
Two folders full of self-decompacting utilities and accessories.
In all, enough to fill two double-sided disks.

MAG 4  MAGGIE 2.0  by The Lost Boys  July 1990 (d/sided)
800K+ of delirious mayhem from the irrepressible Lost Boys.
The introduction alone (a conversion by Manikin of the famous
Red Sector 3D animation) is worth the experience. Contributions
from Next and other friends. Reviews, jokes, tips, more tips,
GFA demos, the Charts, demo cheats, PD section, Mad Max music,
greetings, source codes, etc..

MAG 5  ST-PLUG volume 14  August 1990  (double-sided)
Reviews of EZgrade, Dragon's Lair, F29, Anarchy,...
A virus overview and other news. Amongst the bundled programs are:
Blink utilities, Klickstart menu program, EZgrade teacher's database
preview and a demo of Ice Hockey Simulator.

MAG 6  ST-PLUG volume 15  October 1990  (double-sided)
The best so far. News and reviews are now on two different files.
Eight free PD/shareware programs, including NOVA, a really fine
Galaxian/Zalaga clone and the brilliant BOOK DATABASE by Timothy Early
which alone must be worth all of twenty pounds!

MAG 7  MAGGIE 3 by TLB (November 1990)  (double-sided)
More of the same: reviews, music, hacks, parties, booze, programming,
PD section, etc, etc...   A supplementary disk containing the charts,
and some demo previews is available separately as PD.
