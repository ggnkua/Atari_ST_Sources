          This text explain how to use the fastpoly.s routine.
      
    If you have read the fastline.doc you probably know that my line
  routine is quite "speedy", and I'm really sorry but we cannot say
  such things about my polygone routine. She only draws a few polys
  per second, but she was designed in a week-end, so I didn't optimize
  it a lot. Well, I also lacks of specific ATARI help ( all my friends
  and contacts have an Amiga!) and if I want to know if an idea is faster
  than another, I have to try both. That's the reason why I'm looking
  for contacts! But I will work on it as soon as I can, and if I make
  a fastest version, I will release it as I did for this one. ( I would
  like to make a new coucou box! ) 

    How to use fastpoly.s: ( Which should have been called slowpoly!)
    ----------------------
    
    This is not as simple as for the fastline routine cos you have
  to be introduced with some maths before.
    At first like for the fastline routine you have to define it as
  an included routine:
  
{ Section TEXT
{fastpoly:
{  include	'path\fastpoly.s'
{
{ Section XXX

  Where XXX is the kind of stuff you want to have behind the routine.
  ( BSS,DATA or TEXT!)
  
  Then anywhere in the program, call the routine with the following
  parameters:  a0.l = adress of the ramvideo.
               a1.l = adress of the coords of the brows.
               d0.l = nb of brows.
               
  ( a0 should be a multiple of 2.)
                     
    BUT you should know that the polygone has to be convex!
  This mean that when you take 2 points in the poly, the segment
  defined by this 2 points is entirely in the poly.
  
           /\    This polygone      /\  This one is not!
          /  \   is convex    !    / /  ( concave! )
          \   \                   /  \
           \  /	                  \/\/
            \/
            
    And also  that the polygone has to be defined in trigonometrical
  way! This means that the second point is obtained by an anti-clockwise
  turn from the first point. ( around the center of the poly. )
  
  
          1 _____ 4  A good            1 _____ 2  And a bad one.
           |     |   definition         |     |
           |     |   for the brows.     |     |
          2 ----- 3                    4 ----- 3
          
    So, here is an example for the definition of the brows coords.
{brows:
{  dc.w	$00,$00
{  dc.w	$00,$2a
{  dc.w	$2a,$2a
{  dc.w	$2a,$00
{brows_nb:
{  dc.l	$4

    As for the line rout, the polygone must be clipped.
  I think that giving an example is a good idea, so see
  use_poly for more.
  
                        Don't worry, be happy!
