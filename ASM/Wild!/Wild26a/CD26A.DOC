WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO     WILD!  ]   CD 26A  ]     SPIKE HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S ON THIS DISK....        PRESS 1 FOR      WWF   ]    CRACKED BY ME!!!     (I'VE ALSO PUT A DOC ON THIS DISK)    (TA TO RAYMONDO FOR THE ORIGINAL)        PRESS 2 FOR  SUPANOVA ]    PACKED BY ME!!!            I HOPE YOU LIKE MY MULTIPLE LEMMING MENU!    I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH SPACE, SO THERE'S NO PIC (AS SUCH).          OK, HERE'S SOME NEWS FOR YAS ALL....        WE WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE 2 NEW MEMBERS TO THE CREW.        FIRST, WE HAVE   THE PANFA ] HE HAS BEEN A GOOD PAL OF OURS FOR SOME TIME NOW, SO WE THOUGHT IT ABOUT TIME HE BECAME A MEMBER.    HE WILL BE MAINLY INVOLVED IN PACKING THE GAMES AND COMPILING DISKS.        NEXT, WE HAVE     JAZZ   ] HE WILL BE MAINLY CONCERNED WITH SUPPLYING US WITH PICS AND GRAFIX THAT RAW DATA CAN USE.        I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CREW!!    (ONLY SLIGHTLY THOUGH)         FROM NOW ON, WE WILL JUST BE KNOWN AS   WILD!  ] AND NOT THE WILD! BOYS.        AS I TYPE THIS, RAW DATA IS WORKING ON A NEW LOGO ON HIS BASTARDIZED 386 PC (WITH SUPER VGA)!!!!    (NICE GRAFIX 'RD' LET'S SEE YOU CONVERT IT TO STANDARD ST WITH ONLY 16 COLOURS!!).          THE CHANGE OF OUR NAME WILL ALSO BE GOOD AS THERE WILL BE NO MORE CONFUSION OVER WHO IS GREETED IN SCROLLERS    (I.E. WHETHER IT'S US OR POWERMAN'S DEMO CREW).        MANY PEOPLE WILL SAY,    'WHY CHANGE YOUR NAME, WHEN YOU WERE AROUND SOME 9 MONTHS BEFORE THE DEMO CREW EVEN BEGAN'        WELL, NOW THAT OUR CREW IS GROWING, WE THOUGHT IT AN IDEAL TIME TO CHANGE.          OK, ENOUGH OF THE STRAIGHT TALK, LET'S GIVE THE WILD! GREETZ....        THEY GO TO:-        SPECIAL FX (HI SLASHER, THE PANFA'S GIVEN ME THE CADAVER EXTRA LEVELS DISK. I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT IT SOON.
