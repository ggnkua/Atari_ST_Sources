Sirius-Player v1.1
*==----------------

Well,  not very much to say about this one,  it's quite the same as version 
one, but I kicked out some bugs.



So again the features (press also HELP in the player):
*==----------------

             - 25-KHz-8Bit-Player on STE 

             - 50-KHz-16Bit-Dynamic-Interpolated-Player on Falcon
               (It disturbs sound a bit,  but in my view it gives treble  a 
                kick!)

Alternative Players (without all playerfeatures)
             - Real-50-KHz-8Bit-Player on STE 

             - Real-50-KHz-16Bit-Player on Falcon



             - Playing four AND(!) eight-channel modules!
               (eight  channels on STE only with 12.5 KHz,  but  on  Falcon 
                with ALL! features and 50 KHz!)

             - Mono-Multiplexer (turns interpolation on F030 off!)

             - Sample-Overdrive

             - X-Echo (Pseudo surround with long echoperiod! Nice effect on 
               some Techno/Chiptunes)

             - STE-Microwire-Presets

             - Samplenamesdisplayer

             - Possibility of selecting patterns 

             - Save-Unpacked-Funcion!!!

             - Pack-Ice 2.4 and Atomik 3.5 support.

             -  Noisepakker support!   (You have to change the  first  four 
                 letters of the modulename to 'NPK!' (captials only!  -  no 
                 matter  if   you  rename  before  or  after  packing  with 
                 Noisepakker by deltaforce) so that my player can recognize 
                 the noisepacked format.  This prevents from playing normal 
                 modules which name starts with 'NPK!')

             - full PMD3-support (who guessed that? ;-))

             - Octalyser-Compatible (see also 'BUGS')



'BUGS':
*==----------------

The player is written in that way, that it works like the Octalyser.
So Command D is used hexadecimal (like Octalyser) instead of decimal  (like 
Protracker ST). So if a module sounds a bit damaged then check, if not this 
is the 'BUG'.
I  do  not support the KarPlusStrong-Command (Command 8)!  So this  can  be 
another reason, why your Module might sound corrupted. 

But there is a difference between my player and the one used in Octalyser:
If you play an instrument, then the volume of it will be set immediately. 

And  I support the Invert-Loop-Command (Command EFx) that is missed (or  at 
least  not correctly done) in a lot of STE-Players,  so maybe some  modules 
who  use  that effect sound different after you saved it out  and  play  it 
again! This is because the Invert-Loop-Command directly affects the samples 
and I do not buffer them!



But I have to admit, that the first version of my player had a real bug...
Command E5x (Set Finetune) didn't work correctly (I should always test what 
I optimise...). But it's fixed now!

   Light, but I've nearly rewritten anything.)
