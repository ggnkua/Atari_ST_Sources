  Description: 1024 Point, Complex FFT Test Program

 This program performs a complete 1024 point Fast Fourier Transform
 (FFT) on complex data.  The program calls the FFTR2E and SINCOS
 macros.  The FFTR2E macro has been optimized for speed and executes
 a 1024 point complex FFT in 3.39 milliseconds.
