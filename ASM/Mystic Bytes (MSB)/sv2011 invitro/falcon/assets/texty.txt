After few years of absence MSB is back on the greatest ATARI platform. We would like to invite You on the journey of your lifetime.
SillyVenture 2k11 gives You 100% Atari spirit, countless competitions, various attractions, international visitors and great memories from the golden 90s, when the Atari scene was blooming like flowers.

Take these broken wings, and learn to fly again -  Do You remember
this legendary song back from 80s ? It perfectly fits in to the main
vibe of the SillyVenture 2k11 party in Poland. We want to put some
life into the Falcon's wings and let him fly high again!

During 4 days of partying, from 10th to 13th day of November 2011 we
will celebrate the forthcoming 20th birthday of Falcon. Nothing can
capture to the great times of the Falcon's birth. Magic moments and
magic feelings. For this occassion there's some Silly accents coming
up.

Greetings to all Falconiers left. Never loose the faith! Come at
SV2k11 and save the cool bird! For more party details please visit the
official SV2k11 website: www.sillyventure.pl or get in touch with
