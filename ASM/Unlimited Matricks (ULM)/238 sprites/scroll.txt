Welcome. We write the year 2004. Unlimited Matricks is back. This screen features an enormous amount of 238 sprites at the same time on screen in 1 VBL. To comply with the official sprite contest rules (see http://leonard.oxg.free.fr/record16/record16.html for the whole story) there is a YM music playing and this little scrolltext. Without music and scroller there would be 3 sprites more. Of course, as this is an ULM screen, we could not resist to add some speciality. So the scrolltext is not preshifted or anything like that but is created in realtime. That's why this scrolltext is quite long. Please note also that the font features big and small letters and several special caracters too.         There is a new demo from ULM in the making. It will feature several cool original 8 voice modfiles specially composed by Chris. This demo was planned for 1993 but it never made it to the final stage. Now that the ATARI scene is still around, why not get back to releasing this nice piece? So stay tuned.        If you want to know more about ULM just visit our website at http://ulm.atari.org/ and have fun playing with the online version of The Dark Side Of The Spoon demo.             Here are the credits for this screen: idea by TCB and Leonard. Programming by Gunstick. Sprite by TCB. Background by Gunstick (I just modified the original one from Tanis). Music by Mad Max (he promised me a new one but it never arrived, so it's the standard SOS tune). Colors by Gunstick. Sprite wave by Gunstick based on Leonard's routine. Black background by ATARI :-). This screen surprisingly does not feature overscan. I thought about it but finally it takes quite some CPU time and so the sprite count would have been lower. This screen was completely developed on GNU/Linux (I am currently running gentoo http://www.gentoo.org/) and I would lige to give a special thankg to the Steem team for providing a version for linux. Without this, I would never have started again to program on the ST. The sprite code generator was written in perl, my preferred language for the moment. I would like to specially thank Leonard for giving his advice on coding ideas I had for this screen (which in turn might have triggered a new idea resulting in his newest record). If people are really very insisting I will even release my 247 sprites screen. Yes... that's possible. It exactly looks like this one, same wave, same scroll but with more sprites. Why it's not entered in the contest well... that's just because it's a little cheated. I will need to have some talk with Leonard how much cheating is allowed.           So now this nice and long and slow scroller comes to it's end. I hope you are now convinced that it's not preshifted. ULM rulez!  Let's have a WRAP.
