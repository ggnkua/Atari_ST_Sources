Hi there !!! This is the completely unreadable scroll in our 
Bitmap Screen !!! Other crews only use 4 Bitmaps, we use 6 Bitmaps 
!!! That's a very new trick and we are the first who have discovered
 the 6 Bitplanes Register on the ST Soundchip... We also have discovered 
the Fine Scroll Register allowing us to set the screen address to any 
Bit in the whole memory !!!   Go and have a look at the other scrolls, 
as this scroll may destroy the very little braincells remaining in your 
head...   Bye and see ya soon in some other scrolly message...
