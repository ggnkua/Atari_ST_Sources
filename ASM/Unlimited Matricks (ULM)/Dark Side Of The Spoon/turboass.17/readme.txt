Some explanation about the TURBOASS.TTP. It is a self extracting LZH archive.
Doubleclick on it, then type in the destination directory. It will then create
the executable of Turboass.

This is a minimum Turboass 1.7 as there's not enough room on the disk. The
original Turboass distribution disk contained 1,4 MB of data (tools,
examples and much more useful stuff).

You may want to get a full version. Then write to the following
adress (ask if there's an english version available):
ä-Soft, z.Hd. Markus Fritze
Birkhahnkamp 38
D-2000 Norderstedt 1

Turboass is unfortunatly in German and you will have to use it like that.
If you want to have an ASCII source try out the <ASCII-Sichern> menuentry...
If you have memory problems type SHIFT-F4 then ALT-A to get to the memory
configuration. The first number indicates what's free for the debugger to
run the assembled code (type in the approximative memory required by
the total demo). The second is the size for the code.
If the assembly aborts, then increase the second number.
If the debuggers says 'Speicher voll' then increase the first number.
Some sources require that you don't load the debugger and assemble to disk.

That's all. Have fun with the sources of The Dark Side of The Spoon!
