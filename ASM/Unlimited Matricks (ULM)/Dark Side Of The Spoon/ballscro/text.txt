 Welcome to the ball projection demo. Use the UP DOWN LEFT and RIGHT
keys to move the ball. This screen was coded by me: Gunstick.
The projected grapics were done by various people as it seems to
be very difficult to have ideas what to paint in one color. So it was
very hard to find graphics at the STNICCC even if there are a lot
of good grafixmen round here. But finally I managed to get some stuff
to project on this ball. It's now 1:30 in the morning and we'll never
get the Darkside of the Spoon running today, as the map of the mainmenu
and the resetscreen are not finished.  We are really sorry for all the
people who are waiting for the release moment.      Oh no! There's Fury of
Legacy coming in without his shoes. As we have already some
dogshits on the floor brought in by some fucking lamer (I hope the
concerned person knows what he did to our room) we don't like more
strange smells in here. But I have to say that Furys feet are less
smelly than some months ago.       I will now give the keyboard to Hawkmoon from
the Respectables (again! ). Hello Guys (remark from Gunstick: he doesn't know
what to write, so I'll let you read his silence)                        
             (hmmm can you read silence ???)              No you can't !!!
So Boys I am really tired (2nd remark from Gunstick: I was out for some
minutes (about 10) and Hawkmoon did all you've read now during that time !!)
Fuck off Gunstick you Lipstick (oh ! he get's more agressive here.) I'll
now continue myself. Bye from Hawkmoon.   I forgot to tell you that the music
is by Jochen Hippel of the game Dragonflight. He still is one of the best
musix makers on ST and the first one who published a CD! Well as I'm tired
now, I stop here and go to sleep a bit. Mr Wrap, do your work!
