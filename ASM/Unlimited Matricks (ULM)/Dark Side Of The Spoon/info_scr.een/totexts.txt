Coding by The Fate
The music was composed by Chris of TGE

This screen contains all informations you 
want to know about the screens present in 
the Dark Side of the Spoon Demo



The Intro

The Fate had the idea to do a moving back in 
fullscreen. As always the result is an 
amazing screen with a modfile from Chris 
running at 15 kHz!
Tyrem made the wonderful logos.
The bubbles were taken from a picture by 
SPAZ and rearranged by The Fate



The Main Menu

Again a Fate megacode. We think this menu is 
one of the best, as it features 
bidirectional scrolling. The only one like 
this done before was the Cuddly Demos main 
menu. Add to that the fact that it's playing 
a 4 voice digisound (Chris' best tune) and 
it is a fullscreen 
                                       ...



more about the Main Menu
The graphix were drawn by Tyrem and Hawkmoon 
from the Respectables. They are a real good 
graphix-duo !
ULM and the Respectables began drawing the 
map at the STNICC conference. It was 
finished only a week later.
Have noticed that you can move the little 
flying lion with joystick??? If not, restart 
the demo and enjoy it !!!!!



A little bit of everything

As the name tells you, it's the screen with 
a lot of different things put together by 
the Respectables.
Code by Duke                  
Graphics by Tyrem (of course) 
Music from the game Warp      



The Twiddle Screen

This wonderful demo was a cooperation of 
Manikin (the ball starfield) and Oxygene 
(the rotating scroller).
The music was specially done by Mad Max.
It goes without saying that all of the code 
is stolen from the
Inner Circumsicision (Obviously!!!!!!!!!!)



The Cannibalistic Deforgy

Another screen by the London Bastards.
The 4-demos-at-one-time idea came up in 
Manikin's strange and dirty mind. The 
quartet tune and the graphix were done by 
Spaz.



Unlimited Sprites

Did you find this screen ???
It was coded by The Fate. The sprite and the 
font were drawn by Tyrem. We tried to count 
all theese sprites but as we didn't succeed 
(try to count during 2 hours!) it's left to 
you to find out the exact amount.



Overscan 3D

After The Fate got ready his 3D routines and 
Gunstick finally managed to code a working 
line routine, this screen was quickly coded.
Waveforms and objects by Gunstick. Music 
from the game Wings of Death (it's using 
digidrums, which doesn't make the things 
easier). Logo by SPAZ...



The Playfield screen

This screen by The Fate demonstrates the 
playfield technique of ULM. It features 54 
scrollines (2 normal and 52 little ones in 
the central scroller)
The ULM logo was done by
Hawkmoon (Headkick (CIA (etc ...)))
The hot girl was done by Dizzy of Tool 8. He 
also did the distorter graphics.



The Ball Projector

This screen was coded by Gunstick. The 
projected graphics are by Tyrem and Spaz
The ball was done by Spectrum 512, great guy 
but a bit shy, so Hawkmoon had to correct 
the result.



The Parallax Distorter

It's probably the best fullscreen distorter 
ever done and we think that nobody will beat 
this...

The code was done by Gunstick, the font 
created by OXAR and the wonderful background 
grafix were designed by Dizzy from Tool 8



The 'It's not the right door' screen

You surely know this screen very well, as 
it's called by every door in the doorfield 
of the main menu.

It was coded by The Fate and it's just
a diskfiller or a very good joke
to make you crazy...



The Loader

Very short code by The Fate
The PLEASE WAIT logo was drawn by Dizzy from 
Tool 8
Digisound from Wings of Death



The Disk

It contains 1951348 bytes of unpacked data 
and can be copied by any copyprogram.
(80 tracks/10 sectors/2 sides)
or simply use FCOPY III
If you copy the demo, please try out all 
screens, as NO copyprogram is perfect!!!



Our best routines

In the ULM screens are used various tricks:
The Playfield technique (found by The Fate)
The Hardscroller by Gunstick and The Fate 
                calculated on Sun 4 (SPARC)
The Modplayer by The Fate (4 voices, 
volumes)
The Digiroutines by Gunstick
