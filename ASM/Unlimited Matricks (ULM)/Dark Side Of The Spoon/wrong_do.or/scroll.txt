   HAHAHA...  You entered this screen once more and again you think 
that this screen is very lame...  But, even if this screen doesn't 
feature very good code or graphix, we think that it is a very good 
joke (at least from our point of view...) and with this joke, we beat 
the record of screens ever in a one disk demo...    You will see this 
screen now everytime you enter the wrong doors in the doorfield 
(that's what we call it) while you are on your quest for the hidden 
screen(s)...     Anyway we had some sectors left on the disk and so 
they will be filled up now...    Ok, now it's time that you continue 
with the next doors...
