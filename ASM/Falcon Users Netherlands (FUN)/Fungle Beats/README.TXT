Howdy atari folks,

FUNGLE BEATS is FUN's first demo. Not a 4k-tro, not even a 96K-tro, just a
multipart type of thing. Quite short, but hey.. As we say in Holland:
"klein maar fijn".

Okay: Some crucial info on the PRG-file itself:

* Runs only on an Atari Falcon030 with RGB/TV or a good multisync. No check
  is made for VGA/mono tubes, so beware!
* It should make use of TT-RAM if your Falcon is equipped with such cool
  hardware. If it doesn't please contact the address (earx) below!
* The DSP-modreplay (a very old one) should work fine on accelerators. My
  Powerup2 accelerator has no problems with it.. I just hope Centurbo I/II
  and nemesis will have no trouble either. The demo doesn't touch ACIA's,
  but it could be the modplayer still fucks up the DSP?!?
* Since DEVPAC 3.1 contains some bugs that forced me to put some binary
  files outside of the main executable. These are located in the DATA-
  folder.

And then some chat about our crew:

* FUN is a Dutch crew of Falcon users who produce demos and games and some
  utilities. We are still active (more or less ;-)) and well in 1998.
* FUN consists of:
  * Bonus software (graphics, GFA-code, games)
    bonus@xs4all.nl
  * earx (asm-code, games, demos)
    1028587@ibk.fnt.nl
  * NUT (swapping and asm-code soon)
    ecoplus@knoware.nl
  * otm (GFA-code, asm-code, demos)
  * TheMatch (GFA-code, graphics, music)
    jvanschoot@landstede.nl
  * wingleader (asm-code, demos, games, utils)
* "Men at war" will be the latest 2-player shoot 'em up from us. Contact
  Bonus for more info and send him all your money!!
