        (EIL aftermath version)

Hi ATARIANS!!!

This piece of demo is made especially
and only for you. It runs on all Atari
Falcon's with a minumum of 4MB and
RGB/VGA/TV.

You're dealing with an improved version
here. The version released at EIL was
ridden with glitches, bugs and badly
synced parts. This version fixes these
problems as well as do extras like
displaying more polished fx.

There are still no memorychecks in the
demo-OS. Will have to put that in next
time. So beware. It's best to have some
3.7MB RAM free!

Running:

* Can be run from disk or harddisk or
  whatever. (DVD, VCR, toaster?)
* After loading a bit, a selector is
  prompted. Please select your favourite
  videomode and audiosettings here.
  Detailmode still doesn't work. Hell,
  maybe in a new demo..
* The demo now starts precalcing,
  loading and depacking. After this the
  FUN can begin!

Requirements:

* Basic Falcon030, 4MB RAM.
* TV/VGA/RGB. Will work on all monitors.
* No FPU, 14MB or any other extra's
  are required.
* Running from harddisk is recommended
  due to loadingtime at startup.
* Makes use of TT-RAM and faster CPU if
  detected.
* RGB 50Hz is a reasonable mode. VGA
  100Hz mode adds a few extra's! Really
  funky stuff! VGA 60Hz is crap!

Yeah, this is our second full demo. The
idea was to make a demo to beat the
first one in every aspect and even take
a new direction.

We must say it took alot of time to
finish. Optimising and sqeezing all this
into the RAM of a 4MB Falcon wasn't
easy. Also harddiskcrashes and meltdowns
came our way and we had to abandon tons
of ideas.

Still, here it is. We hope you enjoy it
as much as we enjoyed making it. And
we'd like to thank you for being a
source of inspiration and help to us:
