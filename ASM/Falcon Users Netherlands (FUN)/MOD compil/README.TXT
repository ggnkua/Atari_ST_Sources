Hi Atari fans,

This little module compilation is dedicated to D-FORCE.

D-FORCE has been a highly active and cool member of FUN eversince he joined.
At the PMP he proved just how valuable he is to our crew. A great guy and we
hope we will be a suitable crew for him in the coming years.

He made 4 modules for this compilation. They are:

* Fuzzy Logic       (Very cool song with alot of variation)
* Existance
* Insane
* Satisfactory

Further tracks:

* Suck on this      (NO-XS / Oxyron (c64 - amiga))
* Warm Summer Night (Perkele / Depression)

OK, this production ain't much. Just enjoy the tunes...

 ...and....
 
     stay cool stay atari!
     

PS Perkele: I told you your mod would be used, so here it is! =)
