   Astrid .. for being a great person and a fabulous dancer at those
hot and sweaty exam parties I attended so many....
   Jolanda .. for being unreachable....
   Diana .. for being very sweet and shy...
   Hilde .. for graciously turning me down....
   The mysterious girl in bus 158 to Veghel .. for smiling ever so sweetly....
- AND ALL OTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AND
GIRLS THAT WALK ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH (UTTERLY AND RIDICULOUSLY DEEP
SIGH: SIGH!).            

WELL (RICHARD'S BACK AGAIN!). THOSE WERE ALL THE OBLIGATORY SUBJECTS THAT ALWAYS JUST HAVE TO BE
PRESENT IN DEMOS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT (VARYING FROM HACK INTRO
SCROLLERS TO WALL-PAINTINGS).  AS YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE FOUND OUT BY
NOW, "SYNTH SAMPLE V" IS ALL ABOUT MUSIC. ALTHOUGH I AM AFRAID THAT
IT DOESN'T BREAK MUCH RECORDS (LIKE THE "B.I.G. DEMO"), ONE HAS TO
ADMIT THAT IT ISN'T BAD. THERE ARE TEN PIECES OF MUSIC INCLUDED IN THIS
SAMPLE PROGRAM, THAT CAN EACH BE PLAYED BY PRESSING THE CORRESPONDING
FUNCTION KEYS. LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE MUSIX AND THE KEYS.....F1:
HOLGER CALLED THIS ONE "SPACE INVASION", BUT IT WAS IN FACT INCLUDED
IN A GAME CALLED "TERRA NOVA". IT IS ONE OF HOLGER'S MOST RECENT
COMPOSITIONS.....F2: SPACE PORT THEME. THE "SPACE PORT" GAME HAD TO BE
CONVERTED FROM THE AMIGA TO THE ST IN A MERE THREE DAYS (!). THE GAME
THEREFORE FEATURES NOT-QUITE-SO-SMOOTH SCROLLING AND ISN'T A MATCH, I AM
AFRAID TO SAY, TO THE AMIGA VERSION. HOLGER WROTE THIS MUSIC QUITE FAST,
TOO.....F3: HOLGER CALLED THIS TUNE "TELEMANIA", AND IT WAS IN FACT INCLUDED
IN "SPACE PORT" AS WELL, BEING THE WIN SONG.....F4: SPACE PORT GAME OVER
TUNE.....F5: THE FIRST GAME THAT HOLGER EVER MADE ON THE ST (AND IN FACT
THE FIRST GAME OFFERING GOOD MUSIC ON THE ST) WAS "EXTENSOR". I STILL LIKE
THESE COMPOSITIONS VERY MUCH. THIS IS THE "EXTENSOR" THEME.....F6: EXTENSOR
HIGH SCORE TABLE BACKGROUND MUSIC.....F7: EXTENSOR WIN SONG (RATHER SHORT).....
F8: THIS ONE'S RATHER SHORT, TOO, I AM AFRAID: EXTENSOR CRASH SONG.....
F9: THIS IS THE EXTENSOR TUNE THAT COULD BE HEARD WHILE LOADING. NOT BAD,
IS IT?.....F10: THIS IS AN EXCLUSIVE COMPOSITION, SPECIALLY ARRANGED AND
COMPOSED BY HOLGER FOR THIS "SYNTH SAMPLE V". WE'RE PROUD TO PRESENT TO
YOU: "ELECTRO-STROBE"!    HOLGER GEHRMANN WAS THE FIRST PROGRAMMER ON THE
ST THAT KNEW HOW TO GET GOOD SOUNDS FROM THE ATARI ST SOUNDCHIP (WHICH IS
IN FACT RATHER BAD), AND HE USED A CUSTOM SOUND UTILITY CALLED "SOPROL" (SOUND
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE). MUSIC MADE USING THIS PROGRAM WAS THE BEST MUSIC ON
THE ST FOR QUITE SOME TIME - UNTIL DAVID WHITTAKER, ROB HUBBARD AND MAD
MAX FROM TEX STARTED PROGRAMMING MUSIC ON THE ST.  ANYWAY, IT'S STILL
UP TO HIGH STANDARDS AND INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE BY THE TREMOLO EFFECTS AND
HOLGER'S TWIN-TONE MODE (THAT CAN THEORETICALLY PRODUCE AN EFFECT AS THOUGH
THE ST HAS SIX VOICES!).  SPECIALLY FOR "SYNTH SAMPLE V", HOLGER ADAPTED HIS
"SOPROL" SO THAT IT WOULD WORK ON COLOR-AS WELL AS MONOCHROME FREQUENCIES.  WEIRD
EFFECTS, BY THE WAY, CAN BE REACHED USING THE "plus" AND "minus" KEYS ON YOUR
NUMERIC KEYPAD - THESE CHANGE THE VALUE THAT IS USED TO TRANSPOSE TUNES.
EXPERIMENT A BIT WITH THIS; YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.  SOME OTHER KEYS THAT HAVE A SPECIAL FUNCTION:  
KEYS 1-5: 1 - SCROLL ON TOP OF IT ALL.....2 - SCROLL BETWEEN THINGS.....3 - SCROLL BEHIND IT ALL.....4
- CRYSTAL SCROLL ABOVE IT ALL.....5 - CRYSTAL SCROLL IN BETWEEN.....                
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE NOW STILL WAITING FOR THE EXPLANATION ABOUT OPENING ALL
BORDERS FOR GRAPHICS.....SORRY.....YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST SOME HOURS
LONGER, AS WE'RE NOT EVEN ON A QUARTER OF THE SCROLL TEXT SIZE.....JUST
BE PATIENT!!   WAIT A MINUTE ONCE MORE.....STEFAN IS AGAIN KICKIN' MY BUTT FROM THE
KEYBOARD AND WANTS TO TYPE SOMETHING.....  
   
Allright. I'll take over now. Let's have a little taste of that old computer
generated..... (Art of Noise, the Max Headroom 12")
No, in fact the Chairman and Senior programmer of Digital Insanity is
about to take over in order to add some more stuff to this record-lenght
scrolling message. Not that Richard has run out of juice, oh no.
It is just my time to roll and I can't wait to get to it!
You have read all about the credits and stuff at the beginning of this
message, and you are also informed about the sources of inspiration we
have, (two divine girls). But when Evelien is not there, and when my mind
does not wander ofF into her direction, there are some more sources of
inspiration that I have. They are all connected with certain air vibrations
caused by a high-tech piece of audio equipment in my room. Yes, it is music.
Whenever I sit behind my computer creating something, my stereo is faithfully
producing music. Right now, Jean Michel Jarre's 'Magnetic Fields' CD is 
in my CD player, being scanned by a little laserbeam. Talk of CD's, I just
bought a completely new stereo-set. It is in fact a Midi-set as they call
it, but to me it is just a Mega-Stereo. It has a 85-Watt amplifier, with
connections for CD player, record player, double cassette deck, tuner-timer,
DAT recorder and video recorder. It is the center of the set, completely
remote-controlled. The tuner is a computer-controlled stereo synthesiser
tuner with built-in timer. It has 20 preset stations and the possibility
to program the names of these preset-stations in normal letters. It is
programmable to turn on the entire set, and let's say start playing 'Brothers
in Arms' by Dire Straits from CD at seven o'clock in the morning when it is
time to get up. The cassette deck is a double-deck. It has dolby B and C,
auto reverse on both decks, auto bias, CCRS (Computer Controlled Recording System)
so I can record a CD just by the press of one little button.) Its decks are
completely independent so I can record a CD on deck A, record a single on
deck B and listen to the radio and the same time. It has possibilities for
both normal and high-speed dubbing of cassettes. It also has DPSS (Direct
Program Search System) so it can search and or repeat certain tracks on the
cassette. It has the posibility of synchronised recording, so it will start 
recording an LP as soon as the needle hits the record.
Finally, it has auto-tape select so it recognises a normal, CRO2 or metal tape being inserted.
The CD-player is fully programmable for up to 20 tracks. It has four kinds
of time-displays, 16 bit digital filter, and CCRS as mentioned above. The
record player is also fully automatic. Its tangential arm will scan a record
using a light-beam and will recognize the separate tracks on it and will
determine wheter it is a single or an LP. It can be programmed to play
certain tracks. Finally, the loudspeakers are two high-power 120 Watt Magnat
All Ribbon 5M-MKIII 3-way basreflex speakers ready to blow my mind. I have
tested its capabilities when the neighbours and my parents were gone and
my ears still haven't completely recovered from the unreal vibrations that
struck them. I also suffer from sub-sonic shock and a sonic trauma. The
amplifier was pulling so much juice from the net that my lamp started to
dim at every beat. This was an experience only to be overruled by a real-life
concert. I don't think I should do it again, because the house might collapse.
But I was talking about inspiration. It comes from the following people and
groups of people:
Jean Michel Jarre. He is the ultimate Master of the synthesiser. His music
is timeless. I have been listening to him for about 4 years now (he started
off in 1978!) and I still can't get enough of it. His 'Oxygene', 'Equinoxe'
and 'Magnetic Fields' all are splendid pieces of synthesiser programming.
Especially because the synthesisers weren't so advanced as they are now. We
are talking late seventies, early eighties here! Then there was 'The concerts
in China'. Together with heavy Chinese orchestras, this double-album is a
masterpiece of its own. After this, it was a little quiet around the
Master until he got his hands on a Fairlight and created 'Zoolook' in 1984.
I think this one is still the best thing he has produced. The DDD CD sounds
and is perfect. The fantastic drums and bass are wonderful and he is joyfully
experimenting with sampled human voices in the most exotic languages. 
'Zoolook' is a true masterpiece, yet to be surpassed. After the crash of
the Space Shuttle, his next album, 'Rendez-Vous' was released in 1986 and
dedicated to the crew of the exploded space shuttle. Especially to Ron McNair
who was a personal friend of Jarre. There is a track called 'Ron's piece'.
Ron was about to be the first man to make music in space. Now it is captured
on Jean Michel Jarre's 'Rendez-Vous'. Jean gave two mind-numbing concerts
in Houston and Lyon. Both concerts featured the biggest lasershows ever.
A compilation of the concerts has been recorded on the CD (again, DDD)
'Jean Michel Jarre in concert, Houston Lyon'. The pieces he plays are all
special versions of his exisisting tracks to be found on his various CDs.
I thank this man for many a hour of music-enjoyment. There is one wish I have
and that is to attend a concert of him. I swear that when he comes near or
even to Holland (London, Paris or something), I will go there and attend
the concert. I am a true fan of his, and I can't wait for his next release.. 
BUT THERE IS MORE ... THERE IS ALSO A BAND CALLED 'DIRE STRAITS'. THEY ARE
THE MASTER OF ACOUSTIC, EASY-LISTENING GUITAR BASED MUSIC. I MEAN MARK KNOPFLER
DOES THINGS WITH A GUITAR THAT SEND SHIVERS DOWN MY SPINE. THE 14-MINUTE
TRACK 'TELEGRAPH ROAD' FROM THE ALBUM 'LOVE OVER GOLD' IS STILL THE BEST
SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD. IF I COULD MAKE AN ALL TIMES TOP 100, THIS SONG WOULD
BE ON 1ST PLACE, ONLY TO BE FOLLOWED BY 'PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS', 'BROTHERS
IN ARMS', 'SULTANS OF SWING' AND MORE HEAVENLY COMPOSITIONS BY THESE GUYS.
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT HAPPEND TO JARRE, BUT HIS ENTIRE WORK IS ON
LONELY HIGHTS ONLY TO BE NEARED BY DIRE STRAITS. THERE ARE SOME MORE BANDS
THAT DESERVE TO BE MENTIONED HERE. IT IS QUITE A LIST, AND HERE THEY COME:
ART OF NOISE - FOR BEING REALLY WEIRD  .. ANTHRAX - FOR THEIR "I'M THE MAN"
.. THE PET SHOP BOYS - ELECTRONIC DISCO FULL OF GREAT FX .. THE BEASTY BOYS ..
 - GET DEF AND STUPID .. PUBLIC ENEMY - BUM RUSH THE SHOW! .. LL COOL J -
RAPPIN' MY SOCKS OFF .. RUN DMC - TOUGHER THAN LEATHER .. BEN LIEBRAND -
CREATING FUNKY MIXES .. BLOWFLY - FOR BEING HARDCORE AND X-RATED .. JEFF WAYNE -
FOR HIS "WAR OF THE WORLDS" .. STING - GREAT .. VANGELIS - SYNTH STUFF ..
MICHAEL GARRISON - FOR BEING THE AMERICAN JEAN MICHEL JARRE .. SADE - WARM MUSIC ..
OMD - "MAID OF ORLEANS" .. YELLOW - ALMOST AS WEIRD AS THE ART OF NOISE 
       OK. HERE I AM AGAIN (RITCHIE!!).    
NEXT, WE WILL OFFER YOU THE EXCLUSIVE, MEGA-DEF-EXTREMELY-LIVE-UNCENSORED
VERSION OF THE "ST NEWS" ARTICLE "TEX IN HOLLAND"......IT WILL BE QUITE
A STORY, SO JUST SIT BACK COMFORTABLY AND READ ON! THE STORY STARTS ON
SATURDAY, MARCH 5TH 1988...... THIS ACTUALLY WAS THE FIRST EVER REAL-TIME
STORY EVER TO BE CONCEIVED ON A HOME COMPUTER, AND WAS TYPED DURING TWO
DAYS AND A NIGHT DURING TEX' VISIT TO HOLLAND. EVERY PIECE OF THE STORY
START WITH A TIME DISPLAY, AFTER WHICH THE ACTUAL TEXT FOLLOWS. EACH PIECE
OF TEXT IS CLOSED BY THE NAME OF THE ONE WHO WROTE IT.          
19:00 h (behind the MEGA-ST in the office of STRIKE-a-LIGHT)         
I was sitting in my little room (behind my ST of course) when
some cries from downstairs broke my concentration concerning  all
sorts of problems that bother people my age sitting behind  ST's:
'STEFAN! TELEPHONE!'. I sort of tumbled down the stairs and
grabbed the horn from my mother's hand. 'Hello?' It turned out to
be Richard. 'Guess who is coming to the next meeting?' My first
reaction was 'Willeke...' - 'no way, it's TEX!' (In case you
don't know what TEX is, throw your ST out of the nearest  window
and sit down and think about your sins). I was sort of exCited
when I heard that, and I told Richard I would come, no matter
what (Only one thing could keep me from coming, and that was
Evelien coming on Saturday instead of Sunday...Sigh).   
A couple of days later I was sitting in a train, staring out of
the window, observing the utterly boring Dutch countryside. It
took the train half an hour to take me to Eindhoven, and when I
came out of the station, there was a car with Richard and Frank
in it waiting for me. We arrived at the ST-Club meeting ten
minutes later. TEX said they would come at about 11 O'clock, and
around 11:45, Richard became nervous. Did TEX get lost in the
hopelessly complicated Dutch Infra structure?  Did they end up at
another ST-user group? He and Frank walked around a bit, closely
observing passing cars for German number plates, hoping they
would encounter a car full of ST-freak-looking, German speaking
guys who call themselves The Exceptions. But after walking around
aimlessly for about 15 minutes, they returned. Richard was a
little down, and on his way to the bakery to eat away his sorrows
when a big Audi with German licence plates drove through the
street. He immediately got over-excited, making funny gestures
and even more funny faces in the direction of the German car. The
car drove around a bit, and it finally stopped  on a street
corner. Richard rushed towards it, and nearly dragged the poor
guys out of the car. It turned out to be 5 members of the TEX
group. Jochen the music wizard, Michael, Udo and Gunter the
machine code experts and Erik the graphic artist. Richard danced
around them like a gnat around a flame, asking lots of questions.
I was delighted to meet the guys that created those great  demos,
and I also found out that my German is even more lousy than I
imagined it to be.    
They brought their own computer system,
and after a
few minutes of frantic cable-nagging, the first program called
'Amiga Demo' shocked everybody. They used the right border! It
also included some musix that sounded really great. It wasn't
completely finished yet, but it looked and sounded fantastic
already. They had a lot more great programs and soon, a little
crowd gathered around the table. They showed the newest
slideshows and demos, and I must say I saw some things that
really amazed me. These guys are so quick with their assemblers,
monitors and other programs people like TEX use. Jochen's fingers
tapped  the keyboard like running water, and all sorts of funky
musix soothed my eardrums. Udo was playing around with a monitor,
and all sorts of wonderful things happened on the screen. Erik
showed us some fantastic artwork he created which is used in the
programs TEX writes. They also showed us a game they are working
on - a 'Rollenspiel'; they are momentarily also working on a
Commodore 64 game to be converted to the ST. The first one looks
like an arcade-adventure, including smooth-scrolling backgrounds,
3D-dungeons, great music (of course) and more nice things. It
really promises a lot. The second one is all about  music. You
have no connections, no money and you want to write a hit. This
here problem needs to be solved in this supposedly very nice game
(and, having seen these amazing TEX guys working, I just KNOW
they will succeed!).
Around 15:30, we all headed for the office of STRIKE-a-LIGHT and
there, they really started to freak. The first thing they showed
was a demo created by Level 16 which disposed of all Atari
hardware limitation laws and used all screen-surrounding borders
with supersmooth full-screen diagonal scrolling. Richard nearly
died when he witnessed it, and I was really impressed. The guys
from TEX started working on their 'Amiga Demo', and Richard
nervously wandered around the room, witnessing their efforts to
expand the borders of the ST. Jochen was doing some real-time
programming by making some additional ST NEWS musix and MicHael 
and Gunter did some intro-development.          STEFAN       19:45        
TEX are people too, so it was time to eat (and we too, of
course). We decided to order some pizza (for the data-freaks: 6
Calzone, 2 Americana and 1 Mafiosa (this latter one was, of
course, for good ol' Stefan)), the ultimate behind-the-computer
food) and after some time they arrived.    
Phooow.  Have you ever seen Erik 'absorb' (he later said
'inhale', ED) a pizza in several minutes? It fails to be
described how heavy these pizzas are (the feeling in my  stomach
suffices), but Erik and Jochen really succeed in breaking
records! Jochen is actually multi-tasking at this very  moment,
programming the "Bangkok Knights" music and consuming pizzas. Udo
is momentarily checking the 'Amiga Demo' for the xth time (and -
you guessed it - adding pizza to his metabolism). And they do not
only work fast with their assemblers, but they also know about
making the term 'fast food' live up to its expectations. What? I
had a look at Udo several seconds ago and there was still plenty
of pizza left, whereas I can now hardly see anything?! Erik
has stopped for a moment ("Zu viel Oel" was his comment - burping
away while saying it). What do I see now? Jochen is looking for a
window that's open (for fresh air or to vomit...who'll know).
Stefan is also working away the remainder of his Mafiosa pizza
(also burping away). Just a minute...I'll try to extend my
attention to Eerk (Hofmeester, one of the STRIKE-a-LIGHT guys)
while I have to avoid juice that is launched by Frank's burps.
Eerk is honoured by the attention of everyone present, for being
hopelessly devoted to his Italian thing (that's what it looks
like now, anyway). I wonder if he will succeed. Michael is the
only one not busy looking at Eerk or eating the last Italian
molecule-structural substances - he's admiring Eerk's CD
collection. More guys have finished their pizzas right now, and
work is being continued as usual. Gunter and Udo are working  on
the keyboard routine of the 'Amiga Demo', Stefan is emptying his
nasal cavities, Michael is re-doing the intro, Jochen and Erik are
doing graphics stuff for a 'rollenspiel' and all the other people
that have dropped in recently are chatting along (Frank, Eerk,
Berry, Yolanda & Martin). Robert is still playing the lousiest
game in the universe: A supposed preview of "Thrust". My stomach
is aching (not only because of the pizza that I shared with
Michael, but also because of the Level 16 demo that is still
occupying the vacancies in my brain. Ooops. Hubert van Mil and
his pal Sven came barging in.
For the data-maniacs: There are now 15 people
crammed in the small office of poor "STRIKE-a-LIGHT" (they will
regret this - and they will also have to pay more insurance in
the future, as the guys have quite torn apart the place already
whereas it is not yet late...).
Stefan just got an utterly wei rd idea: Recording the ages of the
TEX members (also for the data'n'statistics freaks): Jochen (Mad
Max) is 16, Erik (ES) is 24, Michael (Daryl) is 19, Gunter (6719)
is 19, Axel (-AFF-, not here) is 27, Markus (BST, not here,
either) is 18 and Udo (-ME-) is 22.             richard            
20:08             
Eerk has just finished the last bite of his pizza.          
Richard          
20:15          
My stomach is aching from the violent satiation it had to suffer
from a few minutes ago. I still am amused by the Amazing Ways to
eat a Pizza I just witnessed. Some used a plate, others folded
the pizza and ate with their bare hands. Erik didn't need
anything, the pizza just disappeared. I did some Interactive
Pizza Swapping with Frank who's Calzone tasted also like a Real
Pizza. The activities have calmed down a bit, Jochen and Erik are
sitting on a couch, with gazy looks. Michael is struggling with
some problems and Udo is still fooling around with the 'Amiga
Demo'. Also, some people have left the office. Hubert, Sven,
Martin, Berry and Yolanda. 'Antarctica' from Vangelis is now
filling the room with divine sounds, and it is all very cosy.
Sitting behind this computer, I dream away. Tomorrow, Evelien
will visit me.... I am recalled to reality by Michael, who
becomes excited when he gets a bus error. He can do some real
debugging now....
  To the right of me, some heavy intellectual conversation is going
on. Erik is explaining to Eerk how to use 'Neochrome' to its full
extend. We all thought Neochrome to be so-so, but after seeing
Erik 'play' with it, the respect for Neochrome grows!        
Stefan         
20:31         
Richard and Frank collect some joysticks, a 'Bubble Bobble' disk
and organize a computer somewhere.  They sit down with determined
looks on their faces; they are going to show TEX just how far
they can get with this amazing game. Frank repairs one of TEX's
home-made joysticks on the spot and they start to play like
maniacs after Richard has been given a shot at trying to crash
the 'Amiga Demo' (he didn't succeed).   
I am amazed by a lot of OOOOHSSS! and AAAAHHHHSSS! from Jochen
and Gunter when Gunter discovers another bug in the 'Amiga Demo'.
They look at each other with fanatic faces and turn to the poor
ST to rough it up a little with more keyboard tapping.        
Stefan        
20:46       
Stefan is now playing 'Bubble Bobble' instead of me. Michael has
lots of my sympathy. A grim look is settled on his face as yet
another few bombs miraculously appear on the ST's screen. Will he
succeed in finishing the new revolutionary intro?  You will know
in a mosdghsf?!?!?!  What?  Did the earth collaps? Has armageddon
arrived? Oh no. It was Erik sneezing. ?&!"?" He did it again!!
I can barely type with all these vibration going  around....Where
was I? Ah. You will know in a moment if Michael has succeeded.
Lucky you: We have to wait a longer time - maybe 'till tomorrow.
Remember: We're in real-time here, and you ain't.         
Richard      
20:51          
I had to flee from the couch due to some anal explosions of mine
(people have the tendency not to like it when you shit on their
couch). Anyway, the smell is now finally winning the combat with
the pizza smells that still penetrate the air to everybody's
great annoyance.         
Richard         
20:56            
Aggravated cries of pure hard core excitement arise from the spot
where two formerly quiet guys are playing 'Bubble Bobble' still.
Due to his supposed fantastic skills, Stefan is taking all the
bonuses, to great annoyance of Frank. That's all there is to say
now.          
Richard       
21:02            
RAAAAAH!!!!!     
While playing Bubble Bobble, Frank and I both died at the same
time at that f.cking level 35. This resulted in a simultaneous
'game over' for us both. And this resulted in a complete 'Game
Over'!!!!! And we still had 7 credits! And my skills were so high
tonight! Darn!   
The screen of Michael's computer now shows a colourful display
with a little movement at the top of the screen and some garbage
and the bottom. He doesn't like it at all, but there are already
way over 16 colors there! Richard told him he would 'spring ein
Loch in die Luft' (jump a hole in the air - spring een gat in de
lucht) when he could create something like it himself.       
21:40        
I don't like this f.cking 6301 at all....
(This is the keyboard processor, ED)         
Udo       
21:45         
The first bags of crisps and 'borrelnoten' (the famous drinknuts
are opened. Richard and Frank are running around with
crunching jaws and enormous bags of crisps in their greedy paws.
    
Boy, playing 'Plutos' with Robert (from STRIKE-a-LIGHT) can  do
wonders to the flexibility of your fire-thumb. It is a little
swollen and feels a little weird after pressing the fire button
let's say 3000 times. I reached level 17 and Robert is still
playing...       
The screen of Michael is being attacked by Gunter with a pencil
to mark the raster-lines. Some letters fly around it, and TEX
still isn't satisfied.     
Stefan     
21:51          
The raster-master himself, Udo, is now assisting Gunter in his
quest to complete Michael's intro. Borders disappear......another
MOVE.W is added......still doesn't work as it should.      
Richard        
22:06         
I think it is time for me to go home. First, I have to travel
through Eindhoven to find the station. Then I have to catch a
train to Den Bosch, and there I have to transport myself from the
station to my mansion by means of a bus. I would have stayed for
the night if it wasn't for Evelien coming tomorrow........
BYE!       
Electronically yours,    
Stefan         
(Michael proves to have a source of inspiration too)       
22:14          
Stefan has just left our small one-day-community for the station,
and Frank has also temporarily left us to help our dear master
programmer reach the station in reasonable safety. And Robert is
about to leave us too, just as Michael and Gunter are making non-
insignificant progress with their small intro (small?!). The
mega-magnificent Jimi Hendrix is currently launching the stunning
notes of his wah-wahd "Voodoo Chile" through the programming
surroundings here, and my psychedelic mood is again present. Hope
I won't act too LSD-d in a minute....Tschuess!        
Richard       
22:don't-ask-me       
Drinking Gin-Tonic and listening to Jimi  Hendrix (the master
himself) doesn't raise the quality of my pixel-putting  business,
although they (Michael and Gunter) want some kind of background
for their bloody border-scroller. Death upon them and all their
slime-sucking descendants.....        
Erik         
22:27          
Michael just knocked me on the shoulder (let's say: A war injury)
requesting me to look at his screen. Nop. Alas. Not yet ready.
Frank has arrived back, and he told me some stories involving the
ultimate temptation: A bunch of "wilde Maedel" nearly stopped them
on their way to the station. Stefan's sense of loyalty made them
not do it (lucky enough - I wouldn't like to see Frank die of
some Sexually Transferable Virus Desease...).      
Richard          
22:35 h          
There's a little panic - we lost the key to the STRIKE-a-LIGHT
Eerk has left it somewhere in the building but
he doesn't know where (maybe he flushed it through the loo?)?!?!       
Frank       
22:41         
Er hat den Schluessel gefunden (quote from Michael). Phew. We
could already imagine our distressed faces pushed to the window,
looking at the firemen outside when the whole place was alight
with us locked inside.
Again another Michael quote (talking about eating more than one
of Mama Leone's pizzas): "Jochen kann schon zwei Pizzas fressen
weil er einen leeren Kopf hat" (translation: Jochen can eat two
pizzas already while he has nothing in his head).     
Richard         
22:54        
The naughty-talk period has started. Around this time, everybody
starts talking about sizes and sexual heroism - and more things
like that. Eerk promised to make me a dragon picture that would
cause me to ejaculate (sorry, under-18-year-olds). He would have
to get paid for two weeks of work. My (dumb, as usual) answer
was: "If I do not ejaculate, I won't pay". Discussion closed.
(Michael fetched a small dictionary and had a good laugh once the
true meaning of the above penetrated his consciousness).       
Richard          
22:58       
Just start, Richard said, and Eerk started writing being the good
obeying (for this last word I really needed to start the built-in
spelling checker; thank you mister First Word) boy he is. What
happened here the last few hours is hardly describable in normal
words, but I think (although I didn't read it yet) that Richard,
Stefan, Frank and the guys from TEX have done their utmost best to
fulfil this sheer impossible task.         
Eerk (after loads of spell-tjekking)           
23:38           
Erik seems to be ready with the graphix for the intro that is
being made - he only worked on them for about half an hour.
Jochen is playing one of the old-time favourites: The highly
unplayable "Tonic Tile".(SKHJFSKDD??!!? Ooops. I sneezed. Udo is finishing
the boot-code for the 'Amiga-demo', so it should be ready within
several minutes (I hope I'm not too optimistic).       
Richard        
23:43 (I still have no watch - have to believe Richard)         
I've done their graphics all right. If you want to see the
silliest pile of pixels I ever managed to shock NeoChrome with,
take a look at the border of our new intro (the one with the
tracking shapes). Ich giess 'mir jetz' tierisch ein' auffe Lampe!!     
Erik       
00:13         
The intro is ready now, and joy is making its way into the minds
of all guys. Udo is still working on the 'Amiga Demo' and is a
little bit pessimistic with regard to the results he will get.
His system is resetting...booting............still booting.......
it smashed down! Starting again...         
Richard          
00:43           
Richard was too optimistic...        
Udo          
00:50            
Michael is trying to get to sleep and Gunter gets his home-made
wine out of his bag, to celebrate the completion of the main
intro routine; we're now only waiting for Jochen's music.      
Frank        
00:56        
No corkscrew!! But Gunter managed in opening it anyway, thereby
nearly killing himself with an enormously sides pair of scissors.       
Richard      
01:00        
My mouth burns and wrinkles walk accross my back and other vital
parts of my physical presence as I have just tried a bit of
Weisenheimer Sonnenberg (1985 Kerner Auslese, home-made, as
before stated) which nearly meant the end of ST NEWS and my life 
on this nice planet earth. I think I'll have another bit.....Hmm.
Not bad, actually (so these people can write demos AND make wine!
What's more to wish?!). I think I'll get pissed.       
Richard          
01:02         
You shouldn't load data over your stack to avoid trouble.      
Udo          
01:05        
Gunter is eating remains of a COLD PIZZA!!! (Yes, this is NO
typing error!). I have trouble keeping mine inside now, when I
see him eating that cold stuff. "Ekelhaft" (Erik quote).         
Richard          
01:16         
Michael is actually asleep, so it seems (sleeping on Richard's
pillow!!!!!).    
"I'm a bit senile" (quote Richard)         
Gunter          
01:35             
The music is now included in the demo, and the whole thing
doesn't work anymore. "Scheisse!", I hear them yell....      
Richard         
01:52         
Things are gettin' to be a little bit quiet here. Udo is still
testing the 'Amiga Demo' boot code, Gunter is still working on
the intro (it still goes wrong), Michael is sleeping (making some
funny noises along the way), Erik is yawning and Frank has gone
to take a nap, too. I am the only non-intoxicated human being
here - I don't do anything except writing this (non-sense) and
looking around. By the way, Udo is now working on the main
program (loading in some weird piece of memory) and not on the
boot code anymore (my mistake, sorry).          
Richard          
01:57         
THE BLEEDIN' INTRO WORKS!!!!!! There is now music, graphics (NOT
busted), side-border, lower  border.........."toll" (just like
they usually say). Only some small things have to be added  and
changed now. But what happened to Jochen? The guy seemed to have
disappeared?!  We all started looking for him, thinking something
evil might have befallen him. But Udo found him, lying in a
corner - suffering from one of his many 'nap-attacks'. Relieved,
Udo sat behind the TEX-computer once more and started doing  even
more work on the 'Amiga Demo'. I hope it won't take long, because
my inspiration is running low as Father time proceeds with his
duties.        
Richard         
02:15          
I'm looking around. Nothing seems to work perfectly. I think I'm
going to shoot myself. Or even better, I think I'm going to shoot
these two lousy programmers, Gunter and Udo. Who has ever said
that TEX would program good demos fast? Eh, Richard you're a
liar! Oh boy, am I depressed...        
Erik         
02:46        
Deep sigh. The intro with tracking sprites (shapes or sprites  -
Erik and Udo are fighting what it is) is ready, but Udo is still
having some problems with the 'Amiga Demo'. His comment: "Er
macht was er gar nicht machen kann" (translation: It does what it
can't do in the first place). I am thinking deeply whether I
should join Frank, Michael and Jochen that are sleeping the night
away (Erik is also lying on the floor, but he seems to be
contemplating rather than sleeping). How will my biorhythm
function tomorrow? I am afraid to think of it. But you know: A
true reporter doesn't stop giving hot news to his  readers just
because there is a certain number on the digital clock or
something similar. Udo's problems are now: "Es tut nicht was es
tun soll" (translation: It doesn't do what it ought to do). He's
talking in riddles now.  Now he says: "Es tut nicht nicht was es
nicht tun kann" (I don't think I will be able to translate that).
I feel more and more intoxicated by sleep as this file grows
bigger and the seconds creep further towards the hour after which
I will probably be a wreck tomorrow....        
Richard          
02:56          
Why should Richard have it better than me (not -ME-)? And such a
chaos rules my home since nearly half-a-year every Saturday ...       
Erik            
03:12        
My legs are beginning to feel heavy as the intro is now really
finished and ready to be used. Are heavy legs the first symptoms
of heavy intoxication with the mysterious SLEEP-virus? Maybe I'll
write a lengthy article about this phenomenon one time.         
Richard          
03:19         
Gigantic bursts appear in the walls as Frank started his snoring
offensive. He's making the foulest noises imaginable. I hope the
neighbours won't rush down to complain. I can hardly type this
text as these noises make my eardrums go puke and make my
internal structure redefine itself (strange way of putting it,
but at this time of night I don't tend to come up with logical
sentences, do you mind?).      
Richard        
03:28        
O.K. I'll give it up. I hope to be woken up in a few hours by the
marvelous sounds of the bootable version of the 'Amiga Demo'.
Even the over-zealous reporter was overwhelmed by the mighty God
of dreams, Morpheus. Let's say Richard's in his sleeping bag, and
I'll do the same (not into the same sleeping-bag, you dumbhead).
Sleep well in your Bettgestell...            
Erik            
03:54         
All around is sleeping well except for Gunter, who is copying some
ST NEWS. I just remembered that the 'set screen' xbios call is 
waiting for the vbl interrupt (which I previously switched off).
It's really getting late now...      
Udo     
04:13       
I'm now sitting together with Udo in front of the computer which
strictly refuses to let the 'Amiga Demo' run. Again, a number of
bugs have  been found... but this try fails also for reasons
unknown. But we saw the title page for a moment.        
Gunter       
04:21           
Hell. Frank's still making such a lot of noises so that I cannot
possibly close my damn eyes! Anyway, I am now one of a few dumb
persons, together with Udo and Gunter. Erik is momentarily
choking himself in his sleeping bag - strange coughing sounds
arise from his sleeping tomb. My throat hurts a bit. Didn't Eerk
tell us to switch off the air conditioning before going to sleep
(to prevent the air from becoming too dry)?  Where's that damn
switch?! The 'Amiga Demo' is still going bad, so it seems. The
screen now turns red all the time, busted graphix.....everything
goes wrong, I'd say. I don't know if my physics will ever endure
such a test again....God, am I looking forward to seeing my bed
when I get home! Let's hope my biorhythm won't be too bad.        
Richard        
04:37     
OK. The demo graphix and loading routine now work, but (you
guessed it, pal) the music doesn't work. The music was originally
written for the upper part of the megabyte, but they now run it
in the lower part and things seem to go wrong there. And whereas
Jochen is still having his 'nap-attack', there seems to be a
slight problem....Did you know that Michael also snores, together
with our good old graphic man Erik?            
Richard           
04:57          
Gunter is now also trying to sleep (since a few minutes already).
He looks rather like one of those Indian Maharishis, but who
cares at this time of day?       
Richard        
05:16         
Udo is getting angrier and angrier by the  minute. That stupid
Jochen has fouled up the whole project again. This afternoon,
they already told me that Jochen was very often to blame when
things went wrong with intros or demos, but now I have witnessed
it myself. Boy, if only Jochen could program as well as he can
make music!        
Richard             
05:44        
Frank just got out of bed and his hair looks really awful. I wish
you could see it all, you would probably laugh yourselves to
bits. Anyway, I don't feel like laughing very much because I
think I have had only half an hour of almost-sleep and that tends
not to suffice for youths that are still growing.          
Richard         
05:48          
I really very much feel like using four-lettered words now,
because good old Frank just hopped right back into 'bed' again. I
had thought he had awoken to give -ME- and me some  company, but
my hopes must have been in vain.          
Richard        
06:32         
The last half an hour I'm sitting here all alone trying to keep
the XBIOS out of my memory (in fact it is the xbios' memory but I
want to occupy it (I mean the memory between $1000 and $a000)). I
must be really stupid to do this job at this time?         
Udo           
06:48         
I awoke (having decided to retreat to my 'sleeping quarters'
several minutes past six) to hear faint noises of triumph: Udo
appeared to have finished the 'Amiga Demo' - but I busted it
again (sorry folks - one should never let one sleepy fool test a
program if there are errors left). Anyway, I think I will visit
the lavatory right now. Udo will have some work to do still. Poor
man. Poor me (sleepy me).          
Richard        
07:04        
Rays of light slowly penetrate through the misty windows of the
STRIKE-a-LIGHT office. This is the final blow for my biorhythm:
It's becoming light again. Eindhoven is still sleeping away the
last night, and some utterly nutty weirdos here are still
computing! Udo doesn't seem to have any problems with it - he
just restarts the newly written 'Amiga Demo' Boot disk the
zillionth time and continues as if nothing exists like 'sleep' or
lack of it. Yawn, yawn. It's getting to be quite chilly, too (but
that's probably because I am not particularly used to not
sleeping an entire night). Udo is now making another attempt to
make the 'Amiga Demo' work. Will it work now? It seems that there
is either a curse on the word 'Amiga' or on me. How can anything
containing the name 'Amiga' in its title work properly on the
highly acclaimed ST? Michael is now also awake (he should be,
anyway, as he is standing erect and with his eyes opened wide in
amazement). The rest is still fast asleep.          
Richard         
07:48         
Gunter wakes up - proBABLY due to Frank's loud snoring (again,
yes). I had to wear STRIKE-a-LIGHT's earphones to protect my ears
from the zoundz arising from his oral Cavities. Jochen (who
sleeps only a few metres from him) seems to be able to handle it
pretty well (he might have Some frantic dreams, though,
penetrated by chainsaw massacres, nuclear explosions, etc.). Udo
is now lying on the sofa, thinking deeply about whaT he has
possible been doing wrong. He told me something about keyboard 
buffers and the stupid operating system that puts keyboard info
right over his demo's note-tables. That's why the demo Probably
crashes all the time.       
Richard          
07:57          
Udo gave up all hopes on finishing the demo now. He actually
shipped his harddisk (weep, weep) and only the man upstairs now
knows what will happen with it. This is a sad moment for demo
history and for a night that could have been spent doing
intellectually stimulating things instead. Sob sob.        
Richard        
08:37       
After playing "Police Quest" for a while (Michael is currently
playing "Rogue 2"), I now feel a bit more relaxed and even feel
like I've slept properly last night. Udo is sleeping (with a hand
in one of his pockets, I might add), Frank is still snoring,
Gunter has gone to sleep again, Erik is still sleeping (in the
biggest sleeping bag ever produced, I suppose), Jochen is still
suffering from the severe consequences of his very serious 'nap
attack'....and WE're playing games. Aren't we a funny bunch?
Since sleep intoxication is wearing off a bit now,  I think
apologies are in order for my stupid use of the Anglo-saxon
dialect on previous pages. Just remember: I was tired, felt
sleepy, and the TEX guys just programmed and programmed (never
wanting to stop until just over half an hour ago). I think I will
continue "Police Quest" now. See ya later!            
Richard 
9:05         
I woke up about five minutes ago - hearing nothing but bad news.
Richard is coming towards me training his anal muscle (the gas is
awful). The new intro seems to be the only thing that is working.
Michael is also still working on something dark. Five minutes
later, Jochen is also awake and Erik seems to be trying to awake.
Or is he?      
Frank        
09:13       
Gunter's lips are obstructed by some curses as he is rudely
awakened by Michael and Jochen. Erik is being very photo-genetic
(Good English?) and they just HAVE to have a picture of that and
Gunter is the only one that knows how to handle the Canon T-70.
Anyway, I hope to see the results once.        
Richard         
09:30        
Moaning and cursing, Erik also arises from his sleeping
residence. "Ist das f.cking Amiga Demo endlich fertig, oder was?"
(Erik quote). The answer is affirmative and he thinks about
retiring back in his overscan-sized sleeping bag. But he doesn't.       
Richard         
09:39          
The age of "Tetris" has now arrived. Jochen and Erik are both
zealously playing this utterly addicting but oh-so-simple game (I
have seen Udo's and Erik's hiscores, so I lost interest).
Everybody is now quite awake except for Udo. He's probably
dreaming about operating systems, how to turn them off, keyboard
buffers (THAT will probably be a nightmare) and finished 'Amiga
Demos'.       
Richard         
09:59         
They really have good cheese down here, it's no rumour!
There's nothing like a good breakfast, yum!      
Erik        
11:02        
At the moment, 24 bombs appear on the screen of the 'Amiga Demo'.
Gunter and Udo are working really hard again, trying to finish it
anyway. I have just been torn away from a succesful game of
"Bubble Bobble" with Frank - Michael is now playing with him, and
they have succeeded in reaching level 63 at the moment (I took
Frank to 61...). Who knows, the 'Amiga Demo' might be finished
after all?! Breakfast is history by now. We have all filled our
stomachs and I will be eating bread for at least some more weeks!          
Richard        
11:36        
Only level 93 with "Bubble Bobble".....we got stuck with 2
credits left. To the right of this MEGA-ST, the guys think they
have  found out why the demo doesn't function  properly. It has
something to do with the spurious interrupt (whatever this might
be). "Das kann ich jetz' hier nicht ausdruecken" (Udo quote).
"Nein, das verstehen noch nicht mal alle Deutschen, was ich dazu
zu quotieren habe" (Erik quote, slightly translated: Nobody would
even understand what I would say).   
"Ich hoffe das wird kein Griff in's Klo (bis zur Schulter)"
(Michael quote - translation: I hope it won't be a deep grab in
the loo - upto your shoulder).        
Richard        
11:48        
Jubel! Yell! Have fun! Call the army! Phone the big bands! The
'Amiga Demo' is now ready!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All night long.....
lotta codeing......and it's now ready!! Word fail to tell which
feelings now flow through our veins.  It must be something like
happyness. Jochen was NOT to blame after all!!!! (For the first
time in the history of TEX-demos!-ES-)       
Richard         
11:50       
That's the proof!!! Playing "Bubble Bobble" is activating your
brain... in level 98 I got the inspiration....       
Udo         
12:09       
Explanation of the little error which forced us 6 hours of work:
To switch off the interrupt of the main screen we used the
command 'and.b #$40,$fffffa09'. This disables the mfp interrupt.
But if an interrupt is just arriving, the mfp tells the MC68000
that there is an interrupt of level 6 priority. As the processor
knows the interrupt bit disabled (opcode above) it knows that no
interrupts are allowed. This causes a 'spurious interrupt' which
is not activated in the ST. Consequently there are 24 bombs
painted on the screen (but at the wrong video address). After
drawing the bombs the TOS tries to execute a 'TRAP #1'
(terminate). But this causes an address error in our  case. But
the address error vector points to an illegal opcode... this
causes an illegal which points to a very high address HUH??!! MBBLBHH??!?!
(Erik sneezed again)... This very high address causes a bus error
which is followed by an illegal instruction and so on....      
Udo 
16:12        
I am now at home, and the long'n'heavy weekend with TEX in the
STRIKE-as-LIGHT office is over. After the 'Amiga Demo' was
finished, everything went rapidly - the demo had to be completely
finished, copied, etc. All machines had to be cleared away, some
photographs had to be taken and checking lists had to be  cleared
if nobody had forgotten something. We actually ordered some more of
Mama Leone's truly excellent Italian food (Lasagna, this time)
and ate again. Erik was again the one to absorb most of it in the
least time (there's space enough there). After lunch, we all
drove home. As I write this down, TEX will probably still be
driving towards Guetersloh (200 km). Poor Jochen, Gunter and
Michael have to drive an additional 400 km....One would tend to
pity these guys. Anyway, my fingers are nearly giving way under
the weight of my arms that now feel heavy with sleep again. I
have to stop. The 'Amiga Demo' is ready. The intro is ready. Many
future ST NEWS musix are ready. Only my sleep isn't ready.               

SO, FOLKS. THAT WAS THE ENTHRALLING STORY OF 'TEX IN HOLLAND'. I SUPPOSE
THAT YOU ALSO READ THE ENTIRE "B.I.G. DEMO" SCROLL TEXT, DIDN'T YOU?!
I HOPE YOU REALISE THAT THIS IS DEFINATELY THE LONGEST SCROLLING MESSAGE
EVER WRITTEN, AND THAT THERE IS STILL A VERY LONG WAY TO GO! AREN'T YOUR
EYES 'MOVING' ALREADY??   ANYWAY, PLEASE READ ON....THE NEXT PART IS
SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISK MAGAZINE "ST NEWS".   OH. YOU MIGHT LIKE TO
KNOW THAT YOU'RE MOMENTARILY READING THE 50TH KILOBYTE OF THIS SCROLLING
TEXT - WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY BROKEN THE WORLD RECORD (42 KB)
THAT WAS SET BY TEX IN THEIR "B.I.G. DEMO".     WHERE WAS I? AH! I WAS
ABOUT TO START WRITING SOMETHING ABOUT "ST NEWS", THE INTERNATIONAL
DISK MAGAZINE.   WELL....         
"ST NEWS" WAS STARTED AS A SMALL HACKER'S MAGAZINE (A WORD PROCESSOR .DOC-FILE)
IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAY OF 1986 BY YOURS TRULY. SINCE I WANTED IT TO BE READ
ALL OVER THE WORLD, I STARTED WRITING IT IN ENGLISH IMMEDIATELY. THE
MAGAZINE REALLY WASN'T WHAT ONE'D CALL 'PROPER' OR 'LEGAL', AND IT WAS A
TRUE HACKER'S MAGAZINE INDEED. LATER, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THERE HAD TO
BE READER'S FEEDBACK, AND THINGS LIKE A 'QUESTIONS & ANSWERS' COLUMN.
THEREFORE, HOWEVER, AN ADDRESS HAD TO BE GIVEN. IN THE AUTUMN OF 1986, "ST
NEWS" BECOME FULLY 'LEGAL' AND STARTED DOING SOFTWARE REVIEWS AND EVEN
SOME COURSES.    IN 1987, THE FIRST ISSUE TO BE LAUNCHED FINALLY INCORPORATED
A GEM-DRIVEN PROGRAM, MUCH IN THE SAME FASHION AS THE CANADIAN DISK MAGAZINE
"F.A.S.T.E.R." (HI GUYS!!). THOUGH NOT REALLY FAST AND NOT ALTOGETHER THAT
USERFRIENDLY, IT SUFFICED TO MAKE "ST NEWS" BETTER KNOWN. SEVERAL PROMOTION
CAMPAIGNS (ONE IN HOLLAND, ONE IN GERMANY AND ONE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD) MADE
SURE "ST NEWS" BECOME MORE AND MORE POPULAR, AND SOON WE HAD OVER 10 OFFICIAL
FOREIGN DISTRIBUTORS. AT THE MOMENT, AN ESTIMATE OF THE READER'S CIRCLE WOULD
BE SOMEWHERE AROUND 40,000 PEOPLE IN ABOUT 15 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. THE 18TH
ISSUE HAS JUST BEEN LAUNCHED (ON THE 9TH OF JULY 1988 - YESTERDAY - ON THE
FIRST DAY OF A "COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ORGY" AT STEFAN'S HOME OF WHICH THIS DAY
- THE DAY OF THE LAUNCH OF SYNTH SAMPLE V - IS THE SECOND AND LAST) AND IS
AGAIN FILLED WITH THE HOTTEST SOFTWARE REVIEWS, NICE STORIES AND FEATURES,
THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT COMPUTER VIRUSES AND MINDBOGGLING FEATURE ARTICLES.
  SINCE THE AUTUMN OF 1987, "ST NEWS" IS ALSO VERY FAST - STEFAN RE-PROGRAMMED
SOME OF THE TIME-CONSUMING ROUTINES IN THE RAW HARNASSED POWER OF 68000
MACHINE CODE. ALSO, JOCHEN FROM TEX (MAD MAX) DID THE MUSIC SINCE AND THAT ADDED
A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION TO THE CONCEPT.    SINCE "ST NEWS" VOLUME 3 ISSUE 3,
I HAVE RESIGNED AS CHIEF EDITOR SINCE I AM GOING TO STUDY IN UTRECHT (BIOLOGY). SO
"ST NEWS" VOLUME 3 ISSUE 4 (THE ONE THAT WAS LAUNCHED YESTERDAY) IS ONLY
HIS SECOND. THE NEW PAGE VIEW MODE IS EVEN FASTER (MAYBE EVEN TOO FAST, EH,
MR. ELLINGHAM?!) AND MORE COMFORTABLE TO USE. YES, STEFAN MADE "ST NEWS"
MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS!!                 
I SUPPOSE THAT'S ABOUT ALL THERE IS TO SAY ABOUT "ST NEWS". I CAN OF COURSE SAY
WHICH ARTICLES ARE GENERALLY PRESENT (COURSE, SOLUTIONS, TIPS & TRICKS, COMPETITIONS, ETC.), BUT I
THINK IT'S MUCH MORE EXCITING FOR YOU TO FIND IT OUT YOURSELF. "ST NEWS" IS
SOLD BY ABOUT ALL PD LIBRARIES IN HOLLAND, EXCEPT THAT OF THE SAG IN HOLLAND (BASTARDS!).
         IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT BOTH THIS "SYNTH SAMPLE V" AND "ST NEWS" VOLUME 3
ISSUE 4 WERE FINISHED IN THE SAME WEEKEND - THERE WAS LOTS OF RUM, COLA, CRISPS,
THINGS TO DO - BUT ONLY ONE ATARI ST COMPUTER! LUCKILY,  STEFAN KNEW HOW TO
STORE ME ON THE ATTIC FOR THE NIGHT (YIPPIE! I HAD ALWAYS HOPED THAT I WOULD
ONCE SLEEP UNDER THE SAME ROOF AS HIS NICE SISTER MELANIE!!) SO WE COULD
PROGRAM THE WHOLE WEEKEND.  HIS NEWLY BOUGHT STEREO TOWER MADE SURE THE
PROPER MUSIC WAS AUDIBLE THROUGHOUT OUR PROGRAMMING EFFORTS (THE NEIGBOURHOOD,
BY THE WAY, COULD ALSO ENJOY IT!).           ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE "ST NEWS" DISK
MAGAZINE? JUST CHECK ANY OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS OUTSIDE HOLLAND, OR ANY DUTCH
PD LIBRARY. THE DISTRIBUTORS MARKED WITH AN EXCLAMATION MARK BEHIND THEIR
NAMES REQUIRE PAYMENT FOR THE PRODUCT, WHEREAS THE OTHERS JUST REQUIRE YOU TO SEND
A DISK WITH REPLY POSTAGE. JUST ADD A NOTE, SAYING: LATEST "ST NEWS".  OUR
FOREIGN DISTRIBUTORS ARE:  HOLLAND.....ST CLUB INTERNATIONAL, P.O. BOX 13672,
2501 ER  'S GRAVENHAGE.....ST CLUB EINDHOVEN (!), P.O. BOX 1424, 5602 BK

        PLEASE LET ME SIGH DEEPLY NOW. AFTER ALL, A LOT OF TEXT HAS BEEN
WRITTEN HERE, AND THIS TENDS TO BE RATHER TIRING - ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ALSO
HAD TO FINISH AN "ST NEWS" ISSUE IN THE SAME WEEKEND!   JUST LIKE THEY DID
IN THE "B.I.G. DEMO", I WILL NOW LET YOUR EYES REST A LITTLE WHILE....
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (ASLEEP YET?) ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (STILL
AWAKE?!)................YOU'RE A TOUGH COOKIE!           HELLO. HERE I AM
AGAIN (STEFAN), TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE DIGITAL INSANITY LABORATORIES.....
    IT ALL STARTED ALMOST ONE AND A HALF YEAR AGO. I ENDED UP AMONGST THE TEN
BEST COMPUTER KIDS FROM HOLLAND IN THE 'MIRCO MASTERS HOLLAND' COMPETITION.
THEY GAVE ME A PHILIPS :YES PC. A VERY NICE COMPUTER WITH A MULTI-TASKING
OPERATING SYSTEM CALLED 'CONCURRENT DOS'. ONLY THEY DID NOT SUPPLY ANY SOFTWARE
TO COME WITH IT SO I REALLY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TO HACK. EVENTUALLY, I ENDED
UP AT A RELATIVELY NEW COMPUTER STORE IN DEN BOSCH AND SWAPPED THE :YES
AGAINST AN ATARI ST. BOY AM I GLAD I DID! I IMMEDIATELY STARTED PROGRAMMING
THIS WONDERFUL MACHINE IN... HOLD ON.... ST BASIC!! YES. THIS WERE THE DARK
AND PRIMITIVE AGES WHEN FRANK OSTROWSKI WAS STILL BUSY CONCEIVING HIS BRILLIANT
GFA BASIC. I WORKED ON A DRAWING PROGRAM BECAUSE I WANTED TO EXPLORE THE
GRAPHICAL CAPABILITIES OF THIS NEW AND WONDERFUL MACHINE. I JUST 'GRADUATED' FROM
A COMMODORE 64 AND I REALLY THOUGHT THE ST WAS THE HOTTEST AROUND. SOON AFTER
GFA BASIC WAS RELEASED, I STARTED PROGRAMMING IN THIS WONDERFUL LANGUAGE BECAUSE
I REALIZED ITS FULL POTENTIAL. I TRASHED THE PROGRAM I WAS WORKING ON AND
STARTED ANEW. A ROUGH VERSION WAS FINISHED AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND WAS
CALLED 'THE ARTIST'. I GUESS THERE ARE SOME RARE COPIES OF IT STILL HANGING
AROUND SOMEWHERE. I WAS NEVER OFFICALLY RELEASED, SO IF YOU HAVE A COPY SOMEWHERE
TUCKED AWAY IN YOUR DISKETTE BOX, YOU HAVE YOURSELVES A COLLECTORS ITEM!
ANYWAY, ONCE AGAIN I DECIDED TO RESTART, AFTER I SAW THE 'GRAPH PRO' PROGRAM,
I KNEW I COULD DO BETTER AND CREATED MY BIGGEST ST SUCCES EVER, THE ARTIST IN
ITS CURRENT VERSION. I WANTED TO PUBLISH IT ON PD, SO I HAD TO HAVE A NAME.
I WAS THINKING HARD UNTIL SUDDENLY I GOT IT....DIGITAL INSANITY! A GREAT NAME!
DIGITAL YET INSANE! I GUESS I AM A FOLLOWER OF THE NOT TOO SERIOUS WAY OF
PROGRAMMING AND LIKE SOME HUMANITY IN MY PROGRAMS. ALRIGHT. THIS IS THE WAY DIGITAL
INSANITY WAS 'BORN' THE REST IS A KNOWN STORY. I GOT IN TOUCH WITH RICHARD,
BECAME A FABULOUS EDITOR ETC. (MODESTY STEFAN, MODESTY). I THINK I'LL LET
RICHARD DO THE TALKING FROM NOW ON......      

WELL. WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF THE SCROLLING TEXT. WHAT WOULD YOU NOW DO
IF I WOULD SAY THAT I REALLY WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO OPEN ALL THE BORDERS
AT ONCE?      WELL: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO OPEN ALL BORDERS AT ONCE! REST
ASSURE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW. IT WAS JUST A LITTLE
TRICK TO MAKE SURE YOU WOULD READ THIS WHOLE DAMN SCROLLING TEXT (AFTER
ALL, I HAVEN'T BEEN SITTING HERE ALL THAT TIME JUST FOR YOU NOT READING IT!).   
DON'T BE ANGRY NOW. JUST BE PATIENT AND YOU WILL READ THE EXPLANATION IN
A FUTURE ISSUE OF "ST NEWS" (NO JOKE THIS TIME).  ANYWAY, I HOPE YOU HAVE
ENJOYED READING THIS LENGTHY TEXT. IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS, THE SCROLLING
TEXT WILL NO DOUBT START ANEW (WE DIDN'T TEST THIS, AS WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO READ THE WHOLE BLOODY TEXT).   OH.   I NEARLY FORGOT THE F.CKING GREETING.
   THEY GO TO THE STICHTING ATARI GEBRUIKERS (SAG, WHICH MEANS "FOUNDATION
ATARI USERS"), FOR HAVING DONE EVERYTHING THEY DO AND HAVE DONE. FURTHER
F.CKING GREETINGS GO TO EVERYBODY WHO CREATES OR CREATED VIRUSES, ESPECIALLY
A GROUP CALLED ACA FROM SWEDEN - THEY MADE A VERY DANGEROUS BOOTSECTOR
VIRUS. IF YOU WANT TO CALL THE ACA VIRUS CREATOR, PLEASE CALL (SWEDEN)
0300-63350. PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO REFRAIN FROM CURSING AND SWEARING TO THIS
MOTHER FOR A SINGLE INSTANT OF A SECOND! KILL HIM!                 
NOW, THE END IS TRULY NEAR.....   YES, I MEAN IT...      DO I MEAN IT FOR
SURE?........   YES, I DO.....   I WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY DAY, AND MAY YOUR
EYES RECOVER FROM READING THIS EXTREMELY LONG TEXT VERY FAST.     BYE!                             
ARE YOU STILL THERE?!  DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME SAYING "BYE!"?     I SUPPOSE
YOU THINK I CAN GO ON WRITING SCROLLY MESSAGES FOR EVER?  WELL, I AM AFRAID
I CAN'T. ALTHOUGH THIS IS JUST LIKE HANGING UP THE TELEPHONE ON SOMEONE
YOU LOVE (FOR ME, THAT'S WILLEKE).   BUT NOW I WILL STOP.  DEFINITELY.
             FULL STOP.          PERIOD.              CAN'T I BE SERIOUS
EVER?   THERE MUST BE A NICER AND MORE ABRUPT WAY TO STOP A SCROLLER. OK.
I FOUND IT. 1..2..3..BYE!!             NO, THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.    
DOES ANYONE OF YOU PERHAPS HAVE AN IDEA?             NO?      I SUPPOSE YOU
WOULDN'T.        DOES THIS LOOK LIKE I AM TRYING TO FILL A SCROLLER TEXT
WITH NONSENSE OR WHAT?!       YES?!!    I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD THINK THAT.
     YIPPIE! I FOUND IT! THE ULTIMATE SCROLLER MESSAGE ENDING SOLUTION!   WATCH
THIS..........ROGER. OVER AND OUT....                  GOOD MORNING (OR
WHATEVER TIME OF DAY IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE). WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO WITNESS
IS PROBABLY THE MOST LENGTHY SCROLLING MESSAGE....GRMMBLL...  I CAN'T STOP!      
SHIT! HELP ME!!          PLEASE HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY, HELP, NOT JUST
ANYBODY, HELP, YOU KNOW I NEED SOMEONE, HEEEEELP!    I MUST BE OUT OF MY
BLEEDIN' MIND TO BE DOING THIS AT THIS UTTERLY UNHOLY HOUR.    STOP! STOP!
PLEASE LET ME STOP! HELP!              NARRATOR: "THEN, RICHARD FELL DOWN
FROM HIS CHAIR, OVERTAKEN BY SLEEP - ALSO PERHAPS BECAUSE HE TOOK TOO MUCH
HEAVY LIQOUR. SO I WILL FINISH THIS SCROLLER UP FOR HIM, AND PUT HIM TO BED.
BYE, BYE!"                                           MMMMBBBLLL.....

TERRIBLE SNORING NOISES).      NARRATOR (BACK, AGAIN): "RICHARD IS NOW
MAKING AWFUL NOISES. I WILL HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THIS SCROLLER TEXT. DIDN'T THIS
ONE BREAK THE WORLD RECORD ALREADY? HE WILL BE SATISFIED IN THE MORNING, NO DOUBT.
SO I WILL AGAIN SAY: BYE, BYE!"                      "NO, LEAVE ME ALONE!!"
