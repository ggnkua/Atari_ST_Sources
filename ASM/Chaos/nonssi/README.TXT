Non-SSI fast DSP protracker player source
Steven Tattersall (Tat/Avena) 1995-1998

Includes a usable DSP operating system,
this uses a file format of its own structure,
but should be compatible with .CLD file as
produced by other DSP assemblers with a little
work. Please excuse this, but my system was
developed _before_ details of the XBIOS system
were revealed!

To assemble, use

	include	soundpr2.s

and call the routines "start_tracker" and
"stop_tracker" (or the other routines at the
start of this source file)
