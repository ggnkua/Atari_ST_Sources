			Hard Disk Saver II

	You know that the only factors of hard-disks crashes are :
		- shocks
		- the age, for a disk it comes from :
			- the magnetic media looses its magnetic properties
			- the motor gets old.

	So a utility that would park your disk when they have power-ON but
are not requested to read or write can increase the hope of life of your
disk by 100 %. (twice the age)
	It's very interesting, especially in the case of a BBS running 24
hour out of 24 ! Think about it !

	This program can park all your hard disks, provided that you run it,
and that you have a XHDI compliant disk-driver, responding to the specifications
version 1.25 (XH_LastAccess) at least (AHDI is not compliant at all) To know if
so, have a look at your cookies, one should be named "XHDI" if so.

	No more need of SAFEAUTO.PRG !
	About HARDSAFE.ACX :
	. you can call it manually (APP,PRG,PRX)
	. put it as an accessory (ACC,ACX)
	. launch it with a command line (GTP)
finally . send a VA_START message (refer to command line).

	The command line can be :
		- "park" to park all hard disks immediately.
		- "time=xx" where xx is the number of seconds of non-use before
		  parking the heads. (10<=time<=999)



			Now, disks, let's say "thanks" to Pierre LALOE
