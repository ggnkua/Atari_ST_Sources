SINGLE-SIDED DISKS:

BU 1 DAMONOID by  Camy Maertens.
The first BUDGIE game. Entirely written in machine code ( like most of
our productions ). 20 planets, no less,have to be protected from Damonoid
and its invading fleet. Action is fast. Time is running out.
Any enemy impact on your planet causes havoc.
You can sustain 13 direct hits. But, should the Damonoid itself land,
the result would be fatal!

BU 2 FOOTBALL 88 by Simon Rush.
A complete manager game. Very addictive Mouse controlled. Colour only.
This program has won worldwide acclaim: Game of The Month  with
17 Bit Software. Game of the Year with FloppyShop Magazine.
Being entirely Gem based, this Football Manager is extremely
easy to play and contains many features that sets it apart from
other offerings, its multi-user capability being one of  them.
If you are a budding soccer supremo this game is undoubtedly for you!

BU 3 BLITZ III by Camy Maertens.
This is a bombing raid with a different scenario: three aircraft
fly in formation, all under joystick control.
The aim of the game is to destroy the city before too much altitude
is lost. With each bombing pass, the altitude drops inexorably.
On some versions a rewarding bonus screen appears after  each successful
mission. This is a classic revisited: it first appeared on the VIC 2O
in 1982.  Budgie UK have added a new twist with multiple aircraft and
variable height control.  
'Challenging game...' (ST Format Feb 89)
'Camy has breathed new life into an old game' (ST User April 90)

BU 4 OTHELLO by Jim Holmwood.
This is an immaculate implementation of the board game of Reversi.
It is entirely mouse controlled and plays a mean game.  You may find it
difficult to beat the computer, but this will maintain its appeal.
Two versions are on this disk: one mono and the other colour.
Also on same disk: TABLIT by Andy Osborne, a scrabble-like game for
two or more players. Points are scored for the longest possible words. 

BU 5 PRO DARTS by Martyn Carr

defuse the bombs before the inevitable blast.  There are many
obstructions in your path, including walls and...skulls.
Also on this disk, by the same author, PUZZLER
a diabolical brain teaser. If you thought the rubik cube was
tough wait until the PUZZLER reduces you to a nervous wreck !

BU 7 BALL ZONE by Ian Grainger  
An incredible Arkanoid type game, only better.
Needless to say, this game is mouse controlled and has many levels.
But the main attractions are the time counter which dramatically
increases the tension and, also, the reassuring presence of base line
tiles which will rescue you in desparate situations.
The score is based on the number of tiles and parasites destroyed and
on the time left at the end of each level. This is an absolute must for
your collection! The first ever Quality game written in HiSoft Basic.
'As good as the 20 quid versions. A veritable tour de force.  93%'
(Andrew Hutchinson, ST FORMAT December 90)

BU 8 SPECULATOR by Camy Maertens
Here we have a true to life simulation based on real futures
markets.   Keep your cool as the Index creates the drama.

to correctly guess the direction of the market.
Trends develop, reversals occur and sudden panics can cause havoc
with  the soundest strategies. Everything that could conceivably
happen in real trading is reproduced in this simulation.
The Index 'point and figure' chart unfolds before your eyes and reveals
your profits or ...losses.  Any open position carrying an
excessive loss is automatically stopped.

BU 9 TYCOON new version by Simon Rush.
A mineral exploring game. The objective is to survey,
test drill and eventually exploit various sites to extract valuable
