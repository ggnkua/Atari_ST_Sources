THE MEDWAY BOYS BRING YOU   MENU DISK  NUMBER  70\             THIS IS THE FIRST MENU I'VE PUT TOGETHER IN OVER 3 WEEKS, SO I THOUGHT I'D MAKE IT A BIT SPECIAL BY RELEASING SOME MUSIC FILES AND MUSIC SOURCE CODES !!!!!              TAKE A LOOK AT THE FILES 'CHAMBERS.S' AND 'MAXPLAY.S'......     THE 'CHAMBERS.S' FILE IS USED ALONG WITH THE 'CHAMBERS.MUS' FILE, AND THE 'MAXPLAY.S' FILE IS USED ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER '.MUS' FILES.         AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MUSIC DATA FILES I'VE MANAGED TO FIT ONTO THIS DISK, BUT THERE SHOULD BE ABOUT 9 OR 10 !!!!!        EACH SOURCE FILE IS DOCUMENTED, SO HOPEFULLY EVEN NON-PROGRAMMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME USE OF THE MUSIX !!!!                   PRESS THE KEYS F1 TO F4 FOR THE FOUR MUSIX FROM CHAMBERS OF SHAOLIN, AND THE + AND - ON THE NUMERIC KEYPAD FOR THE SCROLL SPEED........                    WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEW MENU ????       THE BOUNCY RASTER BAR IS QUITE NICE, BUT I CAN ONLY USE IT WITH PICTURES THAT DON'T HAVE A SOLID BACKGROUND !!!!                WATCH OUT FOR MY NEW INTRO....    I'LL BE USING IT FOR SINGLE DISK CRACKS !!!!                     IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE VIRUS PROTECTOR 2, SO I'VE INCLUDED IT ON THIS DISK ONCE AGAIN........       THE VIRUS PROTECTOR 2 IS FULLY STE COMPATIBLE..... (UNLIKE THE OLD VIRUS-FREE BOOTBLOCK), SO IF YOU SEE ANY BULLSHIT IN MAGAZINES ABOUT THE 'MEDWAY BOYS VIRUS-FREE BOOTER' NOT BEING STE COMPATIBLE, THEN SEND THEM A COPY OF THE NEW VERSION !!!!                        COULD I PLEASE ASK EVERYONE TO STOP PHONING ME UP EVERY NIGHT !!!!!       I'M STARTING TO TAKE THINGS A BIT EASIER ON THE HACKING FRONT (WHICH IS WHY THIS DISK IS 3 WEEKS LATE !!)     AND I'M GETTING PRETTY PISSED OFF WITH ALL THOSE PHONE CALLS !!!!     (ESPECIALLY FROM SOME PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO BE ON THE PHONE EVERY OTHER NIGHT !!!!)                   ..........         SHIT......       AUTOMATION DISK 276 JUST POPPED THROUGH MY LETTER BOX (THANKS VAPOUR !!!), AND CASTLE MASTER 2 IS ALSO ON THEIR MENU.......    NORMALLY IF THIS HAPPENED, I'D TRY TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE ON INSTEAD ('CAUSE I ALWAYS TRY TO RELEASE STUFF THAT HASN'T BEEN ON A MENU BEFORE !!), BUT SINCE THIS MENU WILL BE FINISHED IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES ANYWAY, I DON'T THINK I'LL BOTHER !!!!                    ***  GRAFIX BY WIZPOP , ALL MUSIC BY MAD MAX (RIPPED BY ZIPPY), FONT BY THE OMEN, ALL CODING BY ZIPPY  ***                    I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE SLAGGING WAR GOING ON BETWEEN CERTAIN GROUPS SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO A STOP AT LAST.....           JUST REMEMBER......    NO SHIT GIVEN....       AND NO SHIT TAKEN !!!!                 (THANKS TO JOBIL FOR THAT LITTLE QUOTE !!)
