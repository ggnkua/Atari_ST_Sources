and its invading fleet. Action is fast. Time is running out.
Any enemy impact on your planet causes havoc.

17 Bit Software. Game of the Year with FloppyShop Magazine.

BU 3 BLITZ III by Camy Maertens.
This is a bombing raid with a different scenario: three aircraft
fly in formation, all under joystick control.
The aim of the game is to destroy the city before too much altitude
is lost. With each bombing pass, the altitude drops inexorably.
On some versions a rewarding bonus screen appears after  each successful
mission. This is a classic revisited: it first appeared on the VIC 2O
in 1982.  Budgie UK have added a new twist with multiple aircraft and
variable height control.

tough wait until the PUZZLER reduces you to a nervous wreck !

BU 7 BALL ZONE by Ian Grainger  
An incredible Arkanoid type game, only better.
Needless to say, this game is mouse controlled and has many levels.
But the main attractions are the time counter which dramatically
increases the tension and, also, the reassuring presence of base line
tiles which will rescue you in desparate situations.
The score is based on the number of tiles and parasites destroyed and
on the time left at the end of each level. This is an absolute must for
your collection! The first ever Quality game written in HiSoft Basic.
'As good as the 20 quid versions. A veritable tour de force.  93%'

excessive loss is automatically stopped.

The object is to help Bill find his girlfiend, Sonia, who has wandered
into the old plutonium mine. Bill must search the ten sections of
the old mine, filling as he goes, every segment of the floor.
There are a couple of snags to doing this. Firstly the old closed up

minutes. Secondly, the old mine has become infested with mutant creatures
affected no doubt by the radiation. Great rescue scene (not for children)

BU 102 ESCAPADE by Kathy Steinbach
In the reign of King Louis VI, in the second medieval age, many thousands
of years after the nuclear wars of the 1990s and early 21st century,
there was the frightening practice, known now as the Steinbach phenomenon
This was basically a form of torture used to give pleasure to its very few
spectators, and horror to its victims as can be said of many 'sports' that
have come and gone through the ages. King Louis' unique variation on this
theme was to imprison his victim in a lonely cell atop the sentinel tower,
one of the seven gates leading directly to hell lay unlocked on one side
of the cell, whilst on the other side lay a door locked by a strange device
which was always some sort of puzzle. The victim had as much time as he
needed to open and enter the door of his choice but no food or water was
ever given the victim, while on his plight. Thus effectively imposing its
own limit on time: dehydration. The pressure on the victim and his own
great fear at his situation would sometimes break his mind, when in fact
he would, ordinarily, in other circumstances have easily solved the puzzle
and escaped, to what he would not have known, so you see his dilemma.
'Escapade is the art of the devil' (ST Format Dec 92)

fuel-guage is full. Jump in the ship and off you go to the next level.
Shoot the weirdo's. Some take multiple hits. Some are indestructable and 
some are awfully hard to hit! Anything else that falls down from the top 
of the screen (fuel, ammo, etc...) is there for the taking.
