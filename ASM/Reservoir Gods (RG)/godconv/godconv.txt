GODconverter v1.0

Function:
 Converts GOD Paint images to 14-bit TARGA.

Useage:
 Drop a .god file onto the ttp and voila,
 a second later you have targa named output.tga.

Why?
 Well SH3 / Reservoir Gods made that nice 
 GOD Paint image for the Outline 2004 demo-
 party, and I was too lazy to reboot into TOS
 and load GOD Paint itself. Now I got a targa
 and could watch it with any viewer :)

Bugs..
 Probably loads of them. Handle with care. 
 I take no responsibilityfor eventual 
 filesystem digested while using GODconv.

 There is no check for the GOD header, so
 it will eat any file, not recomended to throw
 a 200MB sample on itthough, might take a
 while to load and save.
