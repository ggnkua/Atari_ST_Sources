                      ----------------------


SamWorks is a simple sample editor to provide basic functions  for 
cutting,  splicing,  converting  and generally messing about  with 
samples.  The  program has been presented in a similar fashion  to 
many of the protracker programs that are available, the screen has 
a  3D look to it and buttons depress when  selected.  SamWorks  is 
actually  just  as  competent  at  sample  manipulation  as  other 
editors, it's only limit is a 100k sample size and 16kHz playback.

When you first run the program you will be presented with an empty 
sample of 100k in length.  The default playback frequency is  6250 
Hz which is equivalent to the STEs slowest DMA playback speed. The 
next  highest DMA speed is also selectable at 12500  Hz.  However, 
because  the  program uses normal ST soundchip playback  the  STEs 
25kHz and 50kHz playback speeds are not represented.

Screen Layout
-------------

The top third of the screen is for sample details;  name, length , 
playback speed and block positions.

The middle of the screen shows the current sample. When the cursor 
is over the sample a yellow line is shown indicating the  position 
of the cursor within the sample.

The bottom third of the screen is for loading and  saving,  sample 
functions and two slider bars for use with the fade function.

Using SamWorks
--------------

Most of the functions require a block to be defined.  To do  this, 
move  the cursor over the sample and press the left  mouse  button  
on  the start of the sample block.  While holding down  the  mouse 
button drag the cursor along to the end of the block then  release 
the mouse button. You can move the cursor either left or right, if 
you moved left then the start and end positions are  reversed.  As 
long  as  a block has been defined then the block  will  be  shown 
inverted.

At  the top of the screen the block start,  end and length of  the 
block are displayed. The current location of the cursor within the 
sample is shown at 'POS:'. 


Load
----

The fileselector defaults to a filename extension search of '.S??' 
which  will display '.SAM' or '.SPL' files as these are  the  most 
common.  If  you  want to load a different  type,  say  an  '.AVR' 
sample, then you will need to changed the filename extension.

Some sample types have a header which contain information such  as 
playback speed but this program will ignore any headers and simply 
load  the  whole file into memory.  If this is the case  then  the 
header will have to be removed with the REMOVE function.

NOTE: Only samples up to 100000 bytes can be loaded.

Save
---- 

It is recommended that you save samples with the extension '.SPL', 
but it's up to you !  The data is pure sample data and no  header 
information is stored.

Play
----

Plays  the  entire sample,  the current block doesn't  affect  the 
playback.  While  the sample is playing a yellow line follows  the 
current position of the sample being played.

To select a new playback frequency either select one of the preset 
frequencies  or click on the green bar on the top slider and  drag 
it along to the desired frequency.  Using the slider you can  play 
slower  frequencies  of  2500-5000 Hz and  higher  frequencies  of 
12500-16000 Hz and any frequency between.

All functions can be used at the same time the sample is  playing, 
but  naturally if you are playing at a high frequency the CPU  has 
less  time  to itself and things will start to  slow  down.  Using 
functions  such  as  fade  are best used  when  the  sample  isn't 
playing.

Stop
----

Stops the sample playback and resets the playback position to  the 
start of the sample.

Convert
-------

SamWorks plays SIGNED samples as does the STE DMA.  If you load  a 
sample  and  it  looks a complete mess or play it  and  it  sounds 
distorted it is probably because it is an unsigned sample. Convert 
toggles between signed and unsigned each time it is selected.

Loop
----

To start with the loop button displays 'LOOP OFF',  when  selected 
it displays 'LOOP ON'. Each time it is selected it toggles on/off. 
When  the  loop  is on the sample will play forever  and  must  be 
stopped with STOP or by selecting LOOP OFF and letting the  sample 
finish.

Zooming
-------

ZOOM  IN allows you to zoom in as many times and as small  as  you 
like. Each time a block must first be selected.

ZOOM  OUT  will show a 1/5th more of the sample each  time  it  is 
selected.  To jump straight back to the original sample hold  down 
the  ALTERNATE key when ZOOM OUT is selected.  You will know  when 
you  have reached the original sample as the block length will  be 
the  same  as  the sample length as displayed at the  top  of  the 
screen.

Copy & Paste
------------

To copy a section of the sample into the copy buffer simply select 
the block and click on COPY.

To  paste the sample held in the copy buffer back into the  sample 
you  must first click on the position within the sample  that  you 
want the copy to be inserted. The rest of the sample is shifted up 
so  make  sure that it is not too large otherwise the top  of  the 
sample will be lost if it exceeds the 100k limit.

Keep
----

Keeps the inverted block and deletes everything else.

Remove
------

Deletes the inverted block.

Fade
----

To start with the fade sliders are set to 100% and 0%,  this  will 
fade  the  selected  block from normal  volume  down  to  complete 
silence. By changing the sliders you can fade in, fade out or even 
amplify your sample.  As the sliders can be moved to a maximum  of 
200% this will amplify you sample by a factor of 2.

Reverse
-------

Physically reverses the selected block.

Exit
----

When  you select EXIT the sample is automatically switched off  if 
it is playing so there is no need to select STOP before exiting.
