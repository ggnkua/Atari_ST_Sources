     [Note  -  I've tended to use the word "game" here  rather  a 
lot;  we do,  of course, release serious utilities, disk mags and 
the  like,  but you eventually run out of synonyms for  "release" 
and "game" is as good as any of them.]

     Organised  Chaos  Licenceware is  very,  very  probably  the 
finest  and fairest licenceware house in the world.  Ah  yes.  If 
washing  powders  and  toothpastes  can  get  away  with  almost-
definitive claims like that, then so can we.

     With OCL,  we put the programmers first.  Royalties are paid 
on  a  strictly sales-related basis - none of this "a  tenner  no 
matter  how  well your game did" foolishness we see  inherent  in 
Budgie  UK.  If your game is good enough to shift a  few  hundred 
copies,  you'll  see a lot of cash being thrown at you.  It  also 
gives  an incentive to produce top-notch games - the  better  you 
make your game, the better the reviews, the larger the sales, and 
you end up getting more money. Lovely. This also works out rather 
well for the punters, who end up buying better quality titles.

     OCL  titles are distributed through PD  libraries,  for  the 
most part.  This is a nicely symbiotic arrangement, beneficial to 
both  parties  -  here  at  OCL  we  don't  have  to  fret  about 
advertising and selling the stuff purely from OCL HQ,  and the PD 
libraries enjoy a nice cut of the profits for their troubles. 

     From each OCL game sold, the PD library takes two pounds, to 
cover  the effort they put it on  advertising,  distribution  and 
everything.  Titles  released on two disks see the  PD  libraries 
taking a bit more, but it's usually just two squid.

     All of the rest goes to the programmer.  If your title sells 
for  a fiver,  and shifts a hundred copies in its first  quarter, 
you'll  get  three  hundred  pounds.  As  well  as  this,  you're 
perfectly entitled to sell your game from home - selling it for a 
fiver will get you four-fifty or something per sale, depending on 
how  cheaply  you can get disks and whether you  bought  lots  of 
stamps before the last postage-price increase.

     Funding  for  OCL  (it does cost us a fair  bit  to  release 
games;  we  have to send copies to all our  distributors)  should 
hopefully  be  covered from the money we get through  direct  OCL 
orders  (when folk buy games straight from OCL HQ,  we get  about 
one-fifty  left over once we subtract stamp and disk  costs,  and 
royalties). Order from Chaos, as they say.

     OCL is probably (probably,  Mr Lawyer,  not definitely)  the 
most helpful licenceware group around.  If you're struggling with 
a  project of yours - you can't work out how to code part of  it, 
you're  stuck for ideas,  you could do with a loading  screen  or 
some  title  music  - we can help.  In  fact,  we  get  hideously 
involved  in your work.  I've even had programmers offering me  a 
share of their game's royalties, with the amount of work I've put 
in. I've refused, of course (I may be rather short of cash, but I 
can  appreciate  that  nobody deserves royalties  more  than  the 
programmer).

     Taking  an example - and I'm sure Harvey Reall won't mind  - 
Antroids  is  one of the games that's seen a lot  of  involvement 
from  myself.  Way  back  in the mists  of  time,  shortly  after 
Genocide's  release and my consequent casting out from Budgie  (a 
long story,  explained in another document  somewhere),  Caroline 
Price from New Age PDL contacted me regarding "Mega Ants", a life 
simulation from Harvey Reall.  Harvey had sent it to Caroline for 
possible  inclusion in her Creative Influence range,  and  -  for 
some reason - she turned it down,  passing Harvey's address and a 
copy of his game on to me.

     At that time, "Mega Ants" wasn't much to behold. Some little 
dots wandering around biting bits out of green circles.  The user 
interface was a mite hostile (Harvey has since admitted this,  by 
the way - this isn't getting at him at all),  and Harvey  planned 
to release it as Shareware. Until I contacted him.

     I saw that the program had potential.  It didn't look  much, 
but I could see that - with a bit of work - it could develop into 
something  muchly better.  DNA programming things  (the  software 
lets  you write "programs" for the ants to follow,  telling  them 
how  to  move,  when  to mate,  and so on) were rare  on  the  ST 
licenceware scene,  and if the program were developed further  it 
could do well.  "Sprites instead of circles," I suggested, "Sound 
effects if you've got the memory."

     Harvey  took heed.  Nice graphics were added,  foolish  spot 
effects,  and the lad spent a year and a bit refining the program 
to make it a great deal better.  It was speeded up a  lot.  Extra 
DNA  commands were added.  Pre-drawn maps could be used,  and  an 
"art package" map designer was added.  Population graphs could be 
produced.  I started work on a loading screen,  and (via the  OCL 
network  of contacts),  we found someone to write a MOD  for  the 
intro screen. "Antroids", as the game is now called, is a hundred 
times  better  than  the version Harvey  planned  to  release  as 
Shareware  all  those months ago -  he'll be getting a  lot  more 
money  from it,  and the customers will be getting a  great  deal 
more enjoyment from it.

     I'm rambling, here. Best wrap up, I think.

     In conclusion,  OCL is dedicated to the programmers'  needs; 
it's the epitome of truthness when we say that programs turn  out 
best if they're something of a team effort.  If you're writing  a 
platform  game  and  you're struggling over some  aspect  of  the 
coding,  we'll  put you in touch with an OCL member who can  help 
you  out.  Even  if you just fancy writing a  text  adventure  or 
something,  where  you've got the ideas but could do with  a  few 
pointers  on what to write it in and how to do it - we'd  contact 
one of our numbers to give you a hand.

     We've  got a network of peripheral entities also - folk  who 
haven't  actually  written  anything,  but are  always  happy  to 
contribute music and graphics to OCL titles. If you fancy joining 
this group,  feel free - the cash you get is negotiable with  the 
programmer you're "working for",  really;  you could argue for  a 
royalty cut,  settle for a one-off payment, or ask the programmer 
to  put your address in the game and ask folk to send you  money. 
I've  recently thrown a tenner at Chris Pritchett for  writing  a 
couple  of MOD tunes for my forthcoming releases - a  good  thing 
for both of us,  as the inclusion of a musical intro to a game is 
likely to boost sales.  And I've also put an advert in both games 
for some more of Chris's music,  which he's selling himself for a 
few quid - so he'll see some interest there.

     Even if you're terrible at computer graphics, can't code and 
are  as  musically inclined as The Wurzels,  you could  join  our 
ranks  as a playtester (all our releases are playtested to  death 
before  release,  and  all testers get a credit in  the  finished 
game) (as well as the dubious honour of being able to play a game 
months  before  its  release),  contribute to ST  Beermat  -  our 
erratically-released disk magazine,  or team up with a programmer 
with you providing ideas.

     In  the unlikely event of you sending me money (you can  buy 
all  OCL  titles  direct from me for  their  usual  price),  make 
cheques payable to merely "Kev Davis".  Sending cash through  the 
post is unwise,  as I can pocket it and claim that it was lost in 
transit,  and you've got no way of finding out where it went. Oh, 
what a giveaway.
