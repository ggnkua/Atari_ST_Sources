Section 2:	System requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.1:	Machine:  Any ST/TT/Falcon  (Tested and works fine on all)

  2.2:	TOS:	  Any TOS not older than 1.04 . (Tested: 1.04, 2.06, 3.06)
		  MagiC, MiNT, nAES, Geneva, MultiTOS, are all optional.
  		  All the above have been tested of course, but versions
  		  much older than those now current (1996) may fail due to
  		  internal bugs of their own. (eg: MTOS <1.08, Geneva 2...)

  2.3:	GDOS:	  NVDI 3.01-4.11 or AMCG_R12 or SPDOGDOS 4.2 .
  		  (others possibly, but only the above are tested)

  2.4:	XBRA:	  No program may bend XGEMDOS vector without XBRA, though
  		  this may function if the bending only occurs before the
  		  start of VDIFont.
  		  (UIS_III breaks this rule, unless you use my revision)

		  From Rev 1.5 VDIFont is better capable of recovering from
		  vector smashing and has even proved able to help other
		  programs in the XGEM vector chain to recover from errors
		  that they have made themselves.  :-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3:	Program purpose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.1:	To allow the use of any GDOS font, of any chosen size,
	to become the main font of the AES system workstation
	(used in _all_ menus and dialogs, systemwide).

	MTOS and MagiC already allowed this, but singletasking TOS
	could only change main font via NVDI, which only accepts the
	three standard sizes and itself chooses between them, such
	that any rez > 640*400 gets 8*16, and any smaller rez gets 8*8.

------------------------------------

  3.2:	To also allow using above-mentioned GDOS font as default
	font for application virtual workstations (mainly for windows),
	and to allow switching such default font and/or size between
	applications (with or without multitasking).

	This has not been possible before, with any tool that I know of...!,
	and means that most old programs that do not handle GDOS, will use
	the chosen GDOS font in their GEM windows (eg: DEVPAC).

------------------------------------

  3.3:	By combining 3.1 & 3.2 above, to allow the majority of serious
	applications and development tools to function in low-rez, by
	choosing fonts & sizes that allow menus and dialogs to appear,
	and be used, as if the programs had been started in medium rez.

	This has certainly never been done before, and the result is
	quite astonishing (especially when using 'overscan'/'lacescan').
	I am writing this text in a DevPac GEM window with 42 lines of
	81 char's visible, and still I see a Directory window and some
	icons beside the text window. (I'm running Magic of course.)
	To do this in a rez with 16 colours has previously required the
	use of some graphics board (or TT/Falcon).

	In fact most of my favourite programs now run as well in lo-rez
	as they do in medium, including 'DevPac', 'Kobold', 'Connect',
	and many others that previously refused to work with low-rez,
	or (at best) worked only with severe limitations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4:	Revision purpose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.1:	Make VDIFont more compatible with other programs, utilities, and
	the multitasking operating systems.

------------------------------------

  4.2:	Make VDIFont capable of enforcing new default font in application
	virtual workstations, as well as in systems physical workstation.
	(old version required separate extra program per application !!!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 5:	Package file manifest
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The VDIFont package as released by me (Ulf Ronald Andersson) contains the
following folders & files:

\AUTO\VDIFONT.PRG		;Main VDIFont program (also CNF tool !!!)

	otherwise you may lack something important.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 6:	Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.1:	Copy VDIFONT.PRG into your \AUTO\ folder, such that it will start
	after your GDOS (NVDI or similar).
------------------------------------

  6.2:	Copy the fonts you need into your GDOS font folder (often \GEMSYS\),
	including the 5 fonts STANSI06.FNT - STANSI10.FNT supplied.
	Do not forget to edit ASSIGN.SYS, to make the needed fonts available
	in each separate resolution (and ALL of them in 'default' device 01).

NB:	Do not use the "s " prefix to choose system font for NVDI,
	since the method used conflicts with VDIFont's method,
	and also does not allow free font sizes.

------------------------------------

  6.3:	Create a folder to contain your collection of configuration files
	for VDIFont (I suggest \VFNT_CNF\ or \GEMSYS\VFNT_CNF\), and copy
	the 9 configuration files STANSI06.CNF - THANSI10.CNF into this.

------------------------------------

  6.4:	Copy one of the configuration files into the root directory of your
	boot drive, and rename it to VDIFONT.CNF

	eg:

	  STANSI10.CNF => ANSI font of 8 * 16 pixels (10 point size)
	  STANSI09.CNF => ANSI font of 8 * 8  pixels ( 9 point size)
	  STANSI08.CNF => ANSI font of 6 * 6  pixels ( 8 point size)
	  STANSI07.CNF => ANSI font of 4 * 6  pixels ( 7 point size)
	  STANSI06.CNF => ANSI font of 4 * 5  pixels ( 6 point size)

	  THANSI10.CNF => ANSI font of 4 * 16 pixels (10 point size)
	  THANSI09.CNF => ANSI font of 4 * 8  pixels ( 9 point size)

	  ANSI7P10.CNF => ANSI font of 7 * 16 pixels (10 point size)
	  ANSI7P09.CNF => ANSI font of 7 * 8  pixels ( 9 point size)

------------------------------------

  6.5:	Copy the file VDIFONTC.CPX into your CPX folder, so you can use it
	to create new CNF files for your collection in \VNT_CNF\.

------------------------------------

  6.6:	If you use 'AsaStart' or 'XBoot' or some similar boot utility,
	set it up to automatically copy the relevant VDIFONT.CNF from
	the collection \VFNT_CNF\ for each of your boot setups.

------------------------------------
This completes the installation for singletasking TOS.
------------------------------------

Most multitaskers allow AES font id and size to be chosen in some config
file and old versions of VDIFont could not enforce fonts contrary to those.
From Rev 1.4 VDIFont can convince all programs that font id 1 means the
font specified by your VDIFONT.CNF file, so you can then use font id 1 for
all the config files of multitaskers.

That means that only the size remains to be chosen, and since this will in
most cases need to be either 10 points (for TT_H, TT_M, TT_L, ST_H) or 9
points (for TT_L, ST_M, ST_L), you only need 2 different files for each
multitasker (unless you want more for other purposes...)

Some of the descriptions below were written before Rev 1.4, so they show
how to enter specific font ids for each multitasker.  In fact this makes
them better as documentation of how that is done, but remember that you
can also choose to use font id 1 consistently, since that now means that
the font chosen by the active VDIFONT.CNF will be used.


For multitasking AES, proceed either from 'Gnva:',
'MagX:', 'nAES:' or "MTOS:' below, in order to set
the font choices for "small" and "large" system font.

With these AES VDIFont is mainly used to set the
default GEM window font for applications.

------------------------------------

Gnva:
    Under GENEVA 3 the 'TASK-manager' has a bug that
    prevents font selection as documented.
    I have managed to edit GENEVA.CNF by 'hand', and
    so may you, but it is beyond the scope of this DOC !!!

    This was fixed in Geneva 4, so there you should
    use 'TASK-manager' to set & save system font.

------------------------------------

MagX:
	For each MAGX.INF file needed by your boot setups, edit that file
	to specify the system font, by inserting a line like this:

#_TXT 6 4 55

NB: This was for MagiC 4, but the commands vary in later versions.
    I do not aim to write a complete MagiC manual here, so you will
    have to look up the changes yourself...

	The first number specifies the height (from baseline) of 'LARGE'
	text, and the second number similarily the height of 'SMALL' text,
	whereas the third number specifies the GDOS font id (52 for STANSI).
	The height values are thus identical to those used with 'vst_height'.
	(Example values are for ST-Low with same line widths as ST-Medium.)

	The height values for the included fonts are:

	13 => STANSI10.FNT of  8 * 16 pixels (10 point size)
	 6 => STANSI09.FNT of  8 * 8  pixels ( 9 point size)
	 4 => STANSI08.FNT of  6 * 6  pixels ( 8 point size)
	 3 => STANSI07.FNT of  4 * 6  pixels ( 7 point size)
	 2 => STANSI06.FNT of  4 * 5  pixels ( 6 point size)

	13 => THANSI10.FNT of  4 * 16 pixels (10 point size)
	 6 => THANSI09.FNT of  4 * 8  pixels ( 9 point size)
	 4 => THANSI09.FNT of  3 * 6  pixels ( 8 point size)

	13 => ANSI7P10.FNT of  7 * 16 pixels (10 point size)
	 6 => ANSI7P09.FNT of  7 * 8  pixels ( 9 point size)
	 4 => ANSI7P09.FNT of  5 * 6  pixels ( 8 point size)

	For other fonts you must use a font editor or file editor to find
	the id and heights. (The relationship of height to points varies.)

	If you have not used variable system fonts before, you should
	really create a collection folder and make several copies of
	your present MAGX.INF there for editing, so you can then use your
	boot utility (AsaStart/XBoot et al.) to choose INF conveniently.

NB:	If you use some desktop not adapted to MagiC, the "small font"
	setting might not be used for the icons, but must be selected
	within that desktop (if such choice is at all available).

------------------------------------

nAES:
	For each N_AES.CNF file needed by your boot setups, edit that file to
	specify system font & icon font, by inserting 5 lines like this:

loadfonts     = true
bigfont       = 55
bigfontsize   = 9
smallfont     = 55
smallfontsize = 8

	Line 1 simply enables N_AES to load GDOS fonts.
	Line 2 gives the font id of the "big font" (menu_bar etc).
	Line 3 gives the font size in points for the "big font"
	Line 4 gives the font id of the "small font" (icons etc).
	Line 5 gives the font size in points for the "small font"

	Note that if these fonts differ from VDIFONT.CNF, the latter will
	be used as default font in application windows only.

	The example sets THANSI09 as "big font" with THANSI08 as "small font"
	which corresponds to the included VDIFONT.CNF .

	If you have not used variable system fonts before, you should
	really create a collection folder and make several copies of
	your present N_AES.CNF there for editing, so you can then use your
	boot utility (AsaStart/XBoot et al.) to choose CNF conveniently.

------------------------------------

MTOS:
	For each GEM.CNF file needed by your boot setups, edit that file
	to specify the system font, by inserting 2 lines like this:

AE_FONTID=52
AE_PNTSIZE=7

	Note that these are _not_ environment variables, so don't use
	'setenv '.  (This is at least the case with MTOS 1.08).

	The number assigned to AE_FONTID, is GDOS font id (52 for STANSI),
	and that assigned to AE_PNTSIZE is of course the size in 'points'.
	(Example values are for ST-Low with same line length as ST-Medium.)

	The sizes for the included fonts are:

	10 => STANSI10.FNT of  8 * 16 pixels
	 9 => STANSI09.FNT of  8 * 8  pixels
	 8 => STANSI08.FNT of  6 * 6  pixels
	 7 => STANSI07.FNT of  4 * 6  pixels
	 6 => STANSI06.FNT of  4 * 5  pixels

	10 => THANSI10.FNT of  4 * 16 pixels
	 9 => THANSI09.FNT of  4 * 8  pixels
	 8 => THANSI08.FNT of  3 * 6  pixels

	10 => ANSI7P10.FNT of  7 * 16 pixels
	 9 => ANSI7P09.FNT of  7 * 8  pixels
	 8 => ANSI7P08.FNT of  5 * 6  pixels

	For other fonts you must use a font editor or file editor to find
	the id and pixel sizes (relationship of size to points varies).

	If you have not used variable system fonts before, you should
	really create a collection folder and make several copies of
	your present GEM.CNF there for editing, so you can then use your
	boot utility (AsaStart/XBoot et al.) to choose CNF conveniently.

	MTOS is unfortunately a (very) bugridden and unreliable system,
	and this includes some inconsistencies in font handling.
	Since MTOS is no longer supported by Atari I strongly suggest
	that all users migrate to some other AES under MiNT (eg: nAES).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 7:	General usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.1	Introduction:

	Having completed your installation according to Section 6 (above),
	you are now ready to begin using VDIFont, so reboot your computer
	and select one of the boot setups prepared for using VDIFont.
	In case of problems during the boot, refer to Section 8 (below).

	Once the desktop is active, first check that you have indeed got
	the system font you intended, and then start some GEM application
	which has some kind of GEM windows, but which doesn't use GDOS.
	(Programs that use GDOS may over-ride the new default font)
	eg: DevPac does not use GDOS, but does use GEM windows

	Now check that the new system font is also used in the application
	windows, as well as in all menus and dialogs.
	If this is the case, your VDIFont installation was successful, but
	otherwise you will need to study Section 8 (below) for explanations.

	If you want to use various fonts for various applications, or
	to change system fonts at resolution changes, you need to read
	the paragraphs 7.2 through 7.x below. Otherwise, run along and play!

------------------------------------

  7.2	VDIFONT.PRG as a general tool:

	As you already know (I hope), VDIFONT.PRG is the main program of
	this package, which installs some new system routines when booted
	from the \AUTO\ folder.
	But, additionally, it is also a general pupose tool which can
	be started from desktop (or as ACC, or from batchjobs), to control
	the operation of the routines installed as mentioned above.

  7.2.1	VDIFONT.PRG with arguments:

	If it is started with arguments (whether as TOS/TTP/GTP/APP/PRG),
	these arguments are treated as follows:

	Numerical arguments:

	0	Turns off forcing of system font \/ Takes effect at next
	1	Turns on forcing of system font  /\ resolution change
	2	Turns off forcing of application fonts \/ takes effect
	3	Turns on forcing of application fonts  /\ immediately

	A non-numerical argument is always assumed to be a complete pathname
	to a new CNF file for VDIFont, and an attempt to to read it is made.
	If this succeds, the font indicated is accepted as new default font,
	and the pathname becomes new default CNF pathname for rez-changes.
	If some error occurs, a message is given, and VDIFONT.PRG switches
	over to interactive dialog mode (see below).

	Since there are 2 on/off flags, and 1 path the number of arguments
	allowed are 1, 2 or 3, and their order is optional.

  7.2.2	VDIFONT.PRG without arguments:

	If started without arguments (whether as ACC/APP/PRG/GTP/TTP/TOS),
	VDIFONT.PRG enters interactive dialog mode (yes, even if TOS/TTP),
	offering the opportunity to control the settings described in 7.2.1
	interactively using mouse (ACC/APP/PRG/GTP) or keyboard (TOS/TTP).
	CNF pathname may then be selected using the normal fileselector
	(but don't do this as TOS/TTP!), with same results as when using
	that pathname as argument (see 7.2.1 above).
	Since this mode is interactive, and self-explanatory, I see no need
	to describe it in detail, but recommend that you try it yourself.

------------------------------------

  7.3	CNF creation using VDIFONTC.CPX

	Use this module (with XCONTROL of course) to create new CNF files
	referring to any GDOS font in your font collection, and also to
	edit the line/lines needed into MAGX.INF/GEM.CNF for MagiC/MTOS.
	(URAn NB: This program is unchanged from the pre-revision package.)

	When saving a VDIFONT.CNF, you get a fileselector, which makes it
	easy to change the path & name, to put the file in a collection.

	But when updating MAGX.INF/GEM.CNF you get no such choice, so to
	put these into a collection you must copy & rename 'manually'.
	My advice is to avoid using these commands at all when you already
	know the font id.  Edit MAGX.INF/GEM.CNF manually instead.

	Note that the CPX is unaware of latest MagiC command formats,
	so human editing is the only safe way to get it right in MAGX.INF
	for modern versions.  Also, as I described further above, you can
	use font id one consistently.
------------------------------------

  7.4	Additional tools:

	There are 6 additional simple tools:

	VFNT_OFF.PRG	=> All workstation font forcing OFF
	VFNT_APP.PRG	=> Only virtual workstation font forcing ON
	VFNT_SYS.PRG	=> Only physical workstation font forcing ON
	VFNT_ALL.PRG	=> All workstation font forcing ON
	VFNT_APT.PRG	=> Toggle virtual (only) font forcing ON/OFF
	VFNT_TOG.PRG	=> Toggle all font forcing like virtual ON/OFF

	These are mainly intended for \AUTO\ folder use (after VDIFONT.PRG)
	to ensure that VDIFont has the right settings, before desktop boot.
	They can also be used from desktop, and with modern desktops they
	can then be controlled by function keys, for greatest convenience
	when often switching between 'new' and 'old' application fonts.

	Older versions of some multitaskers needed to have VFNT_APP.PRG
	directly after VDIFONT.PRG in \AUTO\.  Those who still insist on
	using them could use this method to avoid some of their bugs, but
	my advice is to update the multitasker instead.  That would most
	likely bring many other benefits too.


  7.4.1	VFNT_OFF.PRG:

	This turns off all font forcing for all workstations, but since
	the physical workstation is only opened at desktop boot, the system
	font is not affected by this until the next resolution change/boot.
	Applications already started, will also (usually) keep the font that
	they started with, but applications started later will revert to the
	original system font & size in their windows.
	This program is useful for booting a resolution without any font
	forcing, while keeping the option to switch it on later.


  7.4.2	VFNT_APP.PRG:

	This turns font forcing on for applications, but off for system.
	As described, system font changes only at resolution change/boot,
	and running applications (usually) keep the font they started with.
	Programs started after VFNT_APP will use forced fonts in windows.
	This program should be used when booting a TOS (MTOS/MagiC) which
	must load its system font from GDOS directly, but may not be needed.
	(Modern multitaskers do not need it.)


  7.4.3	VFNT_SYS.PRG:

	This turns font forcing off for applications, but on for system.
	As described, system font changes only at resolution change/boot,
	and running applications (usually) keep the font they started with.
	Programs started after VFNT_SYS use no forced fonts in windows.
	This program is mainly for boots where you want the system font
	to look different from the fonts in application windows.


  7.4.4	VFNT_ALL.PRG:

	This turns font forcing on for both applications and for sytem.
	As described, system font changes only at resolution change/boot,
	and running applications (usually) keep the font they started with.
	Programs started after VFNT_ALL will use forced fonts in windows.
	This corresponds to the default settings of VDIFont, and is useful
	to restore those defaults before a rez-change when forcing was off.


  7.4.5	VFNT_APT.PRG:

	This toggles font forcing on/off for applications only.
	The setting for system workstation is not affected at all.
	Running applications (usually) keep the font they started with.
	Programs started after VFNT_APT will use fonts according to the
	new setting which resulted from the toggle.
	This program is very convenient to have on a function key...!


  7.4.6	VFNT_TOG.PRG:

	This toggles font forcing on/off for applications like VFNT_APT,
	but also copies the resulting state to control system font.
	This is mainly intended to allow a single function key to switch
	forcing entirely on or off, before resolution changes.

	For example, switching to ST_L from TT_M with a 10 point font used
	and enforced would be useless (12.5 text rows on screen), and can
	even cause bombs in the desktop APP.  Using VFNT_TOG before the
	switch turns forcing off, so that ST_L is reached with the normal
	9 point Atari font as system font.  Then when you want to switch
	back to the higher resolution again you can use VFNT_TOG again,
	just before switching, to get back to the font you had.

Section 8:	Possible problems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1:	Broken XBRA vector chains:

	Like many modern programs, this revision of VDIFont requires that
	other vector-bending programs use the XBRA protocol.

	If any program is used which bends the XGEMDOS vector without XBRA,
	it must be started _before_ VDIFont (rearrange \AUTO\).

	If such a program implements AES functions (like UIS_III), they
	can not coexist with VDIFont, since they then repatch the vectors
	at desktop start (controlled rearrangement of this is not possible).

NB:	I have released revised versions of UIS_III and of AMCGDOS, which
	use full XBRA protocol for all vector bending ( => ok with VDIFont).
	Those programs are not in any way my creations, so copyrights remain
	as claimed in their original releases, unaffected by my revisions.

------------------------------------

  2:	Missing GDOS:

	VDIFont requires some GDOS to be installed before its own boot.
	(Rearrange \AUTO\ to ensure the proper order.)

------------------------------------

  3:	Inappropriate GDOS:

	Unfortunately the XBRA concept and other standards of modern Atari
	programming were not established when GDOS was first conceived.
	This means that old versions are unreliable, and must be replaced.
	VDIFont has been tested, and works error-free with the following:

	SPDOGDOS 4.2	(c)1993 Atari Corporation
	NVDI 3.01-4.11	(c)1994 Behne & Behne
	AMCG_R12	(c)1989 Arnd Beižner	(Revised by me 1995)

------------------------------------

  4:	Inappropriate resource files:
	The RSC files of Atari TOS are NOT resolution independent !!!

	They are dependent on resolution in two different ways:

	1: The resolution imposes a definite size limit on all graphics.

	2: The system font character sizes are used for positioning all
	   objects, but are only used for dimensioning _most_ objects.

	The latter means that an RSC created with standard Hi-rez fonts,
	when used with standard Lo-rez fonts, will place and dimension
	objects such that icons and images have too little room.

	It may also lead to some objects being placed behind others...!
	(Lo-rez RSC used in Hi-rez works better, but is still incorrect.)

	These problems can be solved in three ways:

	1: Load the RSC-file into a resource editor (preferably 'Interface')
	   while using the rez & character size you need to adapt it to.
	   Then edit each dialog until they give satisfactory results.
	   Later you can use 'Asastart'/'XBoot' or some such boot utility
	   to activate the RSC files you need, by copying from a collection.

	2: When you write a program, you can create a separate RSC-file for
	   each character size you wish to support.  Then, at runtime, you
	   can select the appropriate RSC file based _not_ on which rez you
	   are using, but on the results of AES function 'graf_handle':
	   EG:	graf_handle(&ch_width,&ch_height,&dummy,&dummy);
	   This will give character cell sizes in 'ch_width' & 'ch_height'.

	3: When you write a program you can create a single RSC-file for
	   a reference character size.  Then, at runtime, you can adapt
	   the position and dimensions of objects yourself, instead of
	   calling the AES function 'rsrc_obfix'. This allows much more
	   flexible positioning of pixel-oriented objects intermixed with
	   character-oriented objects. As always, 'graf_handle' gives the
	   width & height of the current system font.

NB:	An additional problem is caused by the use of 'SMALL' text in objects
	of type 'TEXT' (et al.).
	'rsrc_obfix' appears to dimension these texts like this:

		pixelswide = char_count * ch_width * 6 / 8;

	(where ch_width is given by 'graf_handle' [see above])

	But the actual character size used will always be 6 * 6 pixels,
	so the calculation is correct only if system font has 8 pixel width.
	(This is not completely tested..., may be AES-version dependent.)

	Also, if a very small system font is loaded, the 'so called' 'SMALL'
	font may actually be larger, since it is always the original 'ICON'
	font, and appears unaffected by the font loaded by VDIFont.
	(This definitely varies in newer AES versions.)
	(I hope to change this in a future version of VDIFont.)

NB:	With the new THANSIxx fonts, the standard AES _will_ use THANSI08
	for 'SMALL' text if either THANSI09 or THANSI10 is selected in the
	VDIFONT.CNF file, which eliminates the problem above.
	These fonts have standard height, so vertical problems disappear too.

	Otherwise the best solution is to avoid using 'SMALL' 'TEXT'
	objects in RSC files intended for use with very small system fonts.

Section 9:	Revision release history
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rev 1.0	Was the first revision by me (URAn) and featured a primitive
	(now scrapped) method of enforcing system and application fonts.
	This was released in late september 1995.

Rev 1.1 Was the first revision using the current method of forcing fonts,
	but had several limitations and some definite bugs.
	It was released in early october 1995.


Rev 1.2 Was mainly a bugfix for rev 1.1, but also introduced compatibility
	to Geneva, as well as the extra tools for simplified control.
	This revision was released in late october 1995.


Rev 1.3 Is mainly a patch of 1.2 to make it compatible to "nAES", one of the
	new multitaskers running under "MiNT".  It also includes a new
	tool program, and three "Thin ANSI" fonts that I use for low-rez.
	It was released in mid june 1996.


Rev 1.4 This makes great improvements over 1.3 in the power to enforce font
	usage for more applications, and is safer from unwanted interaction.
	The ANSI7P font family were added to the package to allow users that
	don't have overscan to use GEM windows with 80 chars (or more).

	This means that for multitaskers as well as normal APPs you can just
	specify a font id of 1 (meaning system font), since the new methods
	will always cause this to mean the font specified by VDIFONT.CNF .


Rev 1.5	This has a completely reworked method of protecting the XBRA vector
	chain from harmful effects when non-XBRA users smash the XGEM root
	vector.  Many debuggers (eg: 'Pure Debugger' PD.PRG) do this, as
	well as some other programs.  With older revisions of VDIFont this
	would lead to bombs, but with rev 1.5 it only leads to temporary
	loss of the ability to modify fonts for new APPs.

	As soon as the 'smashing' program restores the vector VDIFont will
	recover that ability. In fact VDIFont can even clean up some errors
	made by other programs in the chain (usually chain loops => lockup)
	so that these are eliminated without any harmful effects.
