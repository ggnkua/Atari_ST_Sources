DOCUMENTATION for COLOR_TT.PRG (TT 3.06/3.05 with or without NOVA 32k).

	This program is freeware and can be distributed, copied,
disassembled (what for? I've added the source), modified, etc...

	This is an AUTO program (launched at boot from the AUTO folder)
that gives the possibility to get COLOR ICONS on the GEM desktop (in 16,
256 or 32768 color modes).
	It allows any resolution change from the desktop and adapts itself
'in real time' to draw the icons correctly according to the number of
planes. If there's only 1 (monochrome) or 2 (ST MED) planes, it is
disabled until the next change of resolution.

How to Install
--------------
	For the first time, it's better to use my RSC set of files:
	1/ save your DESKICON.RSC (change the name)
	2/ in the root directory copy DESKICON.RSC and DESKCICN.RSC
	3/ in the AUTO folder copy COLOR_TT.PRG in the last position
	4/ (if you've got them) remane NVDI and MINT so they won't be
	lauched (change PRG to NUL for example), because COLOR_TT doesn't
	like NVDI much and is useless with MINT and the 4.xx desktop.

	5/ boot again! How beautiful it is! What a marvellous desktop!

NVDI problem
------------
	I don't know where's exactly the problem, but if COLOR_TT is
launched from the desktop (and not from the AUTO folder), a colored
desktop appears even with NVDI! So there's surely only some few changes to
bring to the source, but, as I don't use NVDI, I can't do it...

How to customize
----------------
	If you want to use your own icons, it's very easy: DESKICON and
DESKCICN must have the same number of icons in the same order. The first
has only monochrom ones, the second has mono+colored ones.
	Other limit: each C_ICON in the second RSC must have a 4 plane
image at least, because this is the one I use!

How does it work
----------------
	* It intercepts the old GEM trap #2 and verifies if it's a VDI
vrt_cpyfm call. In this case, the source mfdb address is compared to the
one used by the AES when drawing an icon, and the adress of the bitmap is
compared to the ones loaded in DESKICON.RSC. If everything is OK, the
corresponding C_ICON is transformed to fit the current number of planes
and the call is replaced with vro_cpyfm.
	* NOVA graphic card is detected with it's cookie, and so, COLOR_TT
must be placed AFTER sta_vdi.prg in the auto folder.
	* MiNT is detected with its cookie too, so, as we don't want to
run COLOR_TT with MultiTOS (it's useless), we must place it AFTER MiNT.PRG
in the AUTO folder, this way, it won't be installed if you want to run in
a multitasking environment.

Limits
------
	The program is very 'TOS-VERSION dependant', maybe it won't work
with the 3.01. I've made the test only with the 3.06 and 3.05.
	The size of the DESKCICN.RSC file is limited to 200kb, but you can
change this in the source and re-assemble it.

The source
----------
	Color_tt.s was assembled with ASSEMBLE from Brainstorm (France),
the fastest I've ever seen. There musn't be a lot of changes for a use
with DEVPACK or MAD_MAC.
