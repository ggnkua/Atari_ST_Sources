-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update history of LaceScan (in reverse order) follows:

All versions between 2.6 and 3.1 are 'beta' test versions of the LaceScan
emulator package, whose first 'official' release is version 3.1 .
The new package is SHAREWARE (see RELEASE.DOC).

NB:	Some of the older sections below have been reedited, to remove text
	that would be misleading due to improvements made in later versions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 3.1 relative to version 3.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lace_Mus vectoring was simplified to avoid incompatibilities.
2 new filters for huge monochrome screens were added to Lace_Emu.
2 new keyboard commands for emulator control were added to LaceScan.
LaceScan resolution switch performance was further improved.

OK guys, this is it !!!   The official SHAREWARE release of LaceScan.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 3.0 relative to version 2.9
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pixel size system was adapted for compatibility with NVDI 3.01 .

Resolution change to/from mono monitor was improved significantly.

Some adjustments were made to improve STE compatibility, for those who need
to use the emulator on those machines (1 STE user has registered !!!).

Initialization has been improved, so that LaceScan.Prg now also can be run
from desktop, although it will not then alter the display format until a
resolution change is made.

Lace_Mus, the mouse accelerator, was debugged to pass packets both on stack
and in register a0 (just like TOS), when recursing for large movements.

Unless I get some debug feedback from users, this LaceScan version will
probably be re-released as non-beta version 3.01 sometime in February 1995.
(Ooops: I didn't make that release until March... Sorry!)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.7-2.9 relative to version 2.6
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HUGE changes made to create support for external large-screen emulator.

Cookie 'Lace' is installed at startup, for easier recognition.

The emulator is supplied as a separate program named Lace_Emu.Prg,
and is also documented separately in Lace_Emu.Doc .
Lace_Emu.Prg should be installed into 'Auto' folder so that it runs after
LaceScan.Prg, since it is dependent on finding the 'Lace' cookie.
The main reason why this program is external is that it will allocate
a buffer of 153600 bytes for emulated screen, which may be too much for
some users, who nevertheless wish to use LaceScan.

A mouse accelerator suitable for huge screens is also supplied as a
separate program named Lace_Mus.Prg, and documented in Lace_Mus.Doc .

An ACCessory is also supplied to provide interactive control of LaceScan
and the emulation modes of Lace_Emu.  This program is named Set_Lace.Acc
and may be renamed to Set_Lace.Prg for use as a normal application.
It is separately documented in Set_Lace.Doc.

Significant changes were made for compatibility to MagiX 2.01,
including development of SupX.Prg, a bug-fix program for MagiX.
SupX.Prg installs a 'Supexec' function which is compatible to that in all
Atari TOS (unlike MagiX' Supexec), but is also reentrant (as MagiX requires).

SupX.Prg should be installed into 'Auto' folder so that it runs before
LaceScan.Prg to avoid problems with MagiX.
SupX.Prg can be used independently of LaceScan to help any programs overcome
the problems caused by the Atari-incompatible 'Supexec' of MagiX.
SupX.Prg is the only part of the new LaceScan package which is FREEWARE, and
thus the only part that may be distributed as a stand-alone program.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.6 relative to version 2.5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having missed MTOS releases 1.05 & 1.06, it was with something of a shock
that I discovered that version 1.07 was no longer LaceScan-compatible.
( All older MiNT versions are compatible with old LaceScan releases. )
Also, shortly after that, Martin Bergquist reported the same to be true of
version 1.08 of MTOS, which I later verified when I got it. 

To cure these problems, there are three major changes in this version.

	-------------------------------------------------------------
	1: Obligatory Physbase masking.

Having researched the problem, I find that MiNT erroneously attempts to move
data from the area beyond physical RAM, when booted with LaceScan 2.5 active.
The result of this is inevitably "2 bombs", since it generates a bus error.

This seems to occur due to a misinterpretation of the difference between
"logbase" and "physbase" which is essential to proper LaceScan operation.
The only way to avoid this is to bluff MiNT into believing that screen RAM
resides outside the ST address space (like many VGA boards have it).

LaceScan 2.6 does this by masking the value $01000000 into "physbase" return
values, in addition to the normal overscan offset due to invisible top data.

I have rewritten the routines for XBIOS "Physbase" and "Setscreen" functions,
such that they now accept ("Setscreen), and return ("Physbase") addresses
with _both_ the extra "bluff" bit _and_ the overscan offset, so that the
physical addresses used correspond to "Logbase" values plus "bluff" bit.

Using "Setscreen" with erroneous offsets forces the internal screen RAM of
LaceScan to be used instead of the erroneous addresses.
Only with overscan turned "off" will lacescan allow addresses to be changed
to ones lacking offset and "bluff" bit (gives compatibility and security).

These changes not only cured the problem with MiNT, but also created a
mechanism whereby "Smart" (LaceScan-aware) function calls can be recognized.

This means that "Smart" programs can alter buffer locations, whereas simpler
ones will fail to do so, since LaceScan refuses to use un-offset addresses.
NB: _Total_ refusal is quite normal with large-screen drivers for the ST.

I intend to use this in future emulator programs, that will allow emulation
of even higher resolutions with physical display in LaceScan resolutions.
( Plans include TT-high with 1280x960 pixels, with 800x560 scroll-visible ).


Documentation for how to use this will be forthcoming in future releases.
Do _not_ attempt to use this at present without consulting me first!
The final design is probably going to be a bit more complex than told here.
Not least because I have to maintain future compatibility with MultiTOS.

( If you do experiment with it anyway, please inform me of the results. ) 

NB: as of version 2.7, the emulator described here exists, but does
    indeed use a somewhat more complicated interface to LaceScan.

	-------------------------------------------------------------
	2: Extended supervisor stack handling (again!).

Another serious problem with MiNT, MultiTOS, and all TOS with NEWDESK, is
that they use supervisor stacks far more extensively than older TOS.
This often means that linked add-on system software can become incompatible
simply by assuming free stack room in excess of what's available.

LaceScan has been aware of this since version 2.2, and a cure was implemented
in version 2.3 by dynamic local stack allocation to avoid overloading system.
With version 1.07 of MiNT, however, an additional form of stack handling
reached the point of overload.
To cure this LaceScan 2.6 has dual stack allocation in the affected routines.

Programmers may be interested to now that it was the area indicated by the
"savptr" system variable that needed protection this time, whereas the older
problems consisted of ordinary supervisor stack overloads.

(And I'm afraid this is the reason most screen savers bomb on modern TOS,)
(because they too need to implement this kind of system protection.      )
(They are, after all, linked to the system in a very similar way.        )


	-------------------------------------------------------------
	3: Improved hotkey routines.

In figuring out the reason for the problems above I also found out why the
keyboard hotkey commands could sometimes disturb interrupts.
This seems to be cured now (please tell me if not!), so I have removed the
warning sounds that were given in response to these commands.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

With the above changes, LaceScan 2.6 runs error-free with all known MultiTOS !
please inform me As Soon As Possible if you find any new incompatibilities.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.5 relative to version 2.4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I finally realized that the type of patch into the line_a functions used by
LaceScan (rather similar to that of OverScan), might cause incompatibility.
It was intended to ensure that any bit_blit or raster_copy operations used
the standard screen parameters when used to blit to/from the screen.
But sometimes it can be useful to use _non_standard_ parameters, which was
not possible with this line_a patch installed.
This will probably become an option in a future version.

At present the line_a patch is removed, for improved flexibility.
If this causes any incompatibilities, please contact me.

I have redesigned the auto-switch hardware, such that only two standard
14-pin ttl IC's are needed to implement lacescan autoswitch.
This also meant rewriting the switching routines of LaceScan.Prg, but this
should not cause any problems since few (none?) have the older circuit.
A circuit diagram of the new design in the form of an IMG picture,
"AUTOLACE.IMG", is included in this release package.

I have improved synchronization routines, so hopefully LaceScan should not
be so prone to lose sync anymore, even without auto-switch.
The old solution was dependent on that switch, unlike the new one.

For those who build the auto-switch, I have included 2 simple tool programs
that switch overscan mode on (Lace_1.Prg) or off (Lace_0.Prg).
These are really TOS-type programs that use no GEM features whatever,
nor do they perform any console input or output operations at all.
They simply set the state of the -RTS output of the keyboard-ACIA circuit.

To boot LaceScan in overscan mode place Lace_1.Prg in the auto folder, such
that it boots immediately before LaceScan.Prg, and set the switch to "Auto".
If either Lace_1.Prg is disabled or the switch set to "off", LaceScan will
boot without overscan mode active.
Thus boot utilities (like AsaStart) can enable or disable overscan mode,
without disabling LaceScan.Prg, simply by renaming Lace_1.Prg.

NB: As drawn, the circuit uses a simple on-on_SPDT switch, which gives the
    choices "overscan off" and "overscan software controlled " (or "Auto").
    If you change the switch to an on-off-on_SPDT, you gain the third choice
    "overscan mode on", so you get a full control manual override.
    If any program disturbs the keyboard ACIA, this may be necessary for
    overscan mode to remain active while the (bugged...?) program runs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.4 relative to version 2.3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were only a few 'cosmetic' changes not visible to users.
Even so, they were bugfree improvements, and thus released.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.3 relative to version 2.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a bug in the scroll routine of all Atari TOS for ST/STE/TT, except
TOS 1.00, which garbles the scrolled screen if the byte distance between two
pixel lines is not a multiple of 16 bytes.

The bug disappears when a blitter chip is activated, thus proving that the
software blitter has failed to emulate the hardware correctly.

This has previously affected all overscan operation, since both colour modes
use 236 bytes per line, and mono uses 100 bytes per line, which made NVDI or
Warp_9/Quick_ST necessary for proper scrolling in overscan mode.

This bug is now fixed by LaceScan, in a way that should be compatible with
any TOS >= TOS 1.02 (the fix is never installed on older TOS).
This fix has been tested on both TOS 1.04 and TOS 2.06, without errors.
Please report results on other TOS to me.

NB: Some revisions of TOS 1.02, and all earlier TOS have other serious bugs
    that prevent satisfactory operation in overscan mode.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

If the setting of the overscan switch is altered "on the run" LaceScan will
detect this, and adapt to it, whenever any program starts or terminates, as
well as when any program changes resolution through xbios.
(GEM, however, still requires "desktop" rez change for complete adaption.)

When the overscan switch is "off", LaceScan's behaviour is now more similar
to that of the original screen handler, except for LaceScan's enhancements.

These two changes mean that LaceScan now is compatible to most painting
programs, picture viewers, slideshows etc, although some of them require
that LaceScan is in the "off" state before they are started.

NB: In MultiTOS "switching" of this kind is likely to have unwanted side
    effects, unless the application is able to disable multitasking.
    This is because both AES and its other applications, including Desktop,
    are unaware of the changed format, and will continue to use the one
    in which they were started, which may cause errors.
    This is _no_ bug, either in MultiTOS or in LaceScan, but rather indicates
    a kind of operation totally unsuitable to any multitasking environment.
    For MultiTOS only "proper" resolution changes from desktop are legal.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

A new "hotkey" command has been added, which is intended to toggle the
programmable hardware switch of my overscan circuit.

( Schematics for that design, which only uses four 14 pin standard IC's, )
( will be part of a future release of LaceScan.                          )
NB: From version 2.5 a circuit diagram for an improved design is included,
    in the form of an IMG picture file named "autolace.img".

In total there are now three "hotkey" commands:

<L.Shift> + <R.Shift> + <Insert>   => toggle border color & clear borders
<L.Shift> + <R.Shift> + <Clr/Home> => toggle auto_clearing & clear borders
<L.Shift> + <R.Shift> + <Undo>     => toggle overscan & clear borders

For those lacking my hardware, the new command simply clears the borders.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

The initialization is altered, so that when a TOS is recognized as too old,
or is not recognized at all, the user is prompted to choose whether to exit
LaceScan or proceed anyway.

This was done for two reasons:

1:  No changes are needed to try LaceScan with any new TOS releases,
2:  It is useful in examining some bugs and limitations of older TOS.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier, LaceScan sometimes had problems with overloaded supervisor stacks,
so this version has dynamic stack allocation in stack-intensive routines.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.2 relative to version 2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous versions were a bit inconsistent in boot-up behaviour, and would
not always initialize overscan-mode before initialization of desktop.
This has been corrected and LaceScan should now always activate overscan
mode immediately when it is booted.  (Unless overscan switch is off.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.1 relative to version 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initialization routine of version 2.0 made some mistakes in copying
the original screen into overscanned format.  This could affect memory
after that owned by LaceScan (disturbed reset-proof ramdisk etc).
That has been corrected in this version 2.1 which is otherwise identical.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made in version 2.0 relative to version 1.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version was reached through a series of unreleased updates from
July 1992 through December 1992, with me still the sole author.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

Several small but annoying bugs and quirks have been removed from the code.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

Support for the bug-ridden version of TOS 1.2, that even lacked a proper
software blitting routine, or screen reservation, has been withdrawn.
The code needed for its support slowed down the system even with other TOS.
Users who have it will desperately need to update to newer TOS anyway,
since it cannot possibly be compatible with modern software.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

The program now boots even with OverScan switch off, so that it can be
activated at any later stage, so that work with original screens can be
mixed with OverScan operation without having to reboot the system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The setup routines have been improved as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The flags for 'Bitimage hardcopy', 'Interrupt-fixed borders' and 'Colour',
which were previously global, are now individual per resolution slot.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

All data for all slots are saved whenever one slot is saved, and since data
is still saved in the program itself, that must of course never be 'packed'.

Entry to the setup routine is still made by pressing the left shift key
during the start of LaceScan, or during the start of desktop, which also
occurs when resolution change is requested through the desktop menu.

NB: As of version 2.7 this key is programmable, via Lace_Emu.Inf .

	-------------------------------------------------------------

There are now 10 different 'slots' of screen settings available to the user.
Six of these are preset, two for each hardware resolution 'mode', and they
can only be edited without altering that mode, so they are called 'fixed'.
The remaining four slots may be redefined at will, with a warning given if
this would alter the mode of the slot.

NB: Slots 3, 4 and 5 are intended to replace the original screen modes
    giving access to identical screen sizes with overscan switch on.
    I therefore suggest that you leave them as they are, unless they need
    to be shifted for good centering on your monitor.

I have also added six 'inaccessible' resolution slots, three of which have
settings that exactly correspond to the original ST screen sizes, with such
additional offsets etc. that LaceScan can use them with OverScan switch off.
These tree slots become accessible only with the OverScan switch turned off,
when they (slots 13, 14 and 15) replace the default slots 0, 1 and 2.

The slot for mono without overscan, (slot 15) had to be extended to 410
lines, with ten invisible lines.  Otherwise desktop would not allow any more
resolution changes.  You can edit it back to 400 in case of problems.
(This feature is TOS-dependent anyway. Some TOS just won't let you change!)

Thus you can reach all original screen modes by turning off the switch and
then change resolution, though some screen accelerators will not like this,
since they sometimes object to 'shrinking' resolutions like this.
GEM itself, and the original desktops do accept it though.

You can also do this inside the setup routine, by selecting slots and/or
resolutions, and then toggle the switch before pressing 'Y' to activate.
This is very practical when setting up several slots for the future.

The final three 'inaccessible' slots are reserved for future emulators.

NB: As of version 2.7 slot 12 is used for external large-screen emulator.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

With the switch set to overscan mode, LaceScan will always boot slot
0, 1, or 2, corresponding to the active hardware resolution mode.
The setup program can then be used to swap to another slot.
There are, however, certain restrictions on this:

  You may now (from version 3.1) swap between mono and color resolutions.
  LaceScan will refuse to do so, and state this in an error message,
  but will also ask you if you really want to try switching monitor type.
  If you confirm this, LaceScan proceeds with the resolution switch.

  For this to be practical however, you will need either a multisync
  monitor, or some interface allowing both mono and colour monitors to be
  connected at the same time.  (The latter is what I use.)

NB: As of version 2.7 the external emulator can be used to switch between
	mono and color instead.

  Screen accelerators are a problem since most of them will only allow an ST
  at most three different screen sizes (one per resolution) and will not
  tolerate any size changes once a resolution has been entered.

  This goes for QST2 and all its descendants, including all WARP_9 versions.
  They must be rebooted before a resolution may use another size safely.
  NOTE: It sometimes seems to work for a while, only to end with bombs...!

  This is really ridiculous since GEM itself never has made any assumptions
  about this, so that new sizes should be legal after any resolution change.

  NVDI is the most tolerant I know, and will accept size changes, provided
  you always exit the setup routine with the 'requested' resolution active.
  I you started setup by requesting 'medium' from 'low', you should select
  a slot with 'medium' resolution last before leaving the setup routine.

NB: As of LaceScan 2.7 the above is no longer necessary with NVDI 2.50
NB: As of LaceScan 3.0 NVDI 3.01 also works without problems

  If these rules are broken with non-NVDI screen accelerators in the system,
  there will be bombs !!!

  There may be similar problems with some GDOS variants, since they also
  interact with the 'workstations' of GEM.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

For experimentation purposes, I have made it possible to set resolutions in
'High' or 'Medium' mode that give smaller screens than the originals.
(eg: 320*200 Monochrome, or 320*200 Medium, which are the minima)

Such resolutions are not intended to be used, and will probably not work
with NVDI or WARP_9, that will not consider such resolutions "possible".
(eg: QST2 bombs on certain GEM operations with 320*200 mono)

	-------------------------------------------------------------

Since many GEM-oriented utilities seem sensitive to resolution changes, such
that they demand that a mode requested on entry must also be active on exit
from the setup routine, I have added a safety feature for checking this.

When a user attempts to exit in a 'wrong' resolution, a message appears that
requires him to type 'X' to exit.  Any other response leads back into the
setup routine so he can select some suitable resolution slot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here follows the original (re_edited) text as supplied with version 1.2:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program LACESCAN.PRG was written by me in February through July of 1992,
as a replacement for the older OVERSCAN.PRG by the authors mentioned above.
I wrote it to satisfy my need for an overscan-driver which was compatible to
the new TOS versions, since the PD versions of OVERSCAN.PRG could accept
no TOS beyond version 1.4 .

Since I was very fond of the original OVERSCAN, I have modeled my LACESCAN
program after it.  Thus LACESCAN can be used as a direct replacement for it.

	-------------------------------------------------------------

This first release (Version 1.2) is intended primarily for TOS 2.06 .
It will of course also work with TOS 1.4 and most older TOS.

I will not attempt to document the OverScan hardware mod, or the principles
behind it in this small doc file, since such documents already exist.
Interested readers should look for the file OVERSCAN.LZH, which archive
contains several document and picture files relating to OVERSCAN.PRG.
It should be available at every well stocked BBS for the ST.

Any comments/queries regarding LACESCAN should be sent to:

	Ulf Ronald Andersson
	H”ders  V„g  7
	S-145 70  Norsborg
	Sweden

That street address may of course be written as "Hoders Vag 7", in case
you feel uncertain about Swedish characters.  
That will usually be understood, even though it is incorrect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

LaceScan was written to operate with my homebrew overscan hardware which
can be disabled from software.  Thus it may (like OVERSCAN.PRG) lose sync at
initialization and at resolution changes when used with standard overscan.

Sync can then be regained by two methods:
  1: Toggle your overscan switch until you achieve sync.
  2: Give the Shift/Shift/Insert command to LaceScan.prg until you have sync.
     (Hold both shift keys while you hit the "Insert" key.)

NB: If you use the latter method, make sure you do not repeat the command too
    fast, since this may cause a synchronization conflict.
    You should wait for the special key-sound to finish before trying again.
    This rule also applies to the Shift/Shift/Clear command.

+NB: As of version 2.6 the last advice above becomes irrelevant, since new
     interrupt protection has been included, and the warning sound removed.
     
	-------------------------------------------------------------

Also, due to hardware differencies, the initial settings of LaceScan may not
fit your monitor.  This is easily fixed by the same method as with OverScan.
Simply hold the left shift key during initialization, or during a resolution
change, to enter the "Setup menu", where you can adapt LaceScan as needed.

NB: As of version 2.7 the key combination is programmable via Lace_Emu.Inf

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Closing comments:

The name LaceScan derives from the fact that my homebrew hardware generates
interlaced sync signals as well as the overscan display enable.
The LaceScan program is "aware" of this, but not dependent on it.

Since this program was written mainly as a replacement for one by another
author, I have decided to release it as PD FREEWARE.

NB: But as of version 2.7 the package has been extended far beyond the
    limits of any previous package of this kind.
    I have therefore decided that the next public release will be SHAREWARE.
