		ABOMBINABALL

  Welcome to Abombinaball, a fast paced
and infuriating  puzzle game by  Martin
Brownlow.  The game has no plot,  which
is good,  since you're probably all fed
up reading loads of drivvle about magic
kingdoms and so on and so on.
  Each level is made  up of a series of
tiles,  which more often  than not make
up  a  crude  picture.   Most of  these
tiles will  disappear when you jump off
of them, although there are some speci-
al types of tile (see later).   On some
tiles  there are bombs,  and the aim of
each level  is to defuse all the  bombs
by landing  on them.   The only problem
is you can only  defuse a bomb while it
is "counting down",  and only one  bomb
can count  down  at a time.   In short,
you have to  collect the  bombs in  the
right  order and before  its timer runs
out.
  On nearly every level,  you will come
to a time when you need to get across a
gap in the tiles that  you created when
you  passed that  way earlier.   It's a
good job,  then,  that on  nearly every
level you have an allocation  of jumps.
A jump  allows you to  leap over a tile
or a gap or, indeed, a wall.

  Abombinaball consists of fifty levels
of brainbending puzzles.

Controls
--------
  The game  is controlled by  joystick,
with the  four  directions  moving your
ball and the fire button in conjunction
with a direction making it jump.
  Also, every game,  you have a "SKIP",
which is  activated by  pressing  space
during a level.  The skip will skip the
current level  when activated,  but you
only have one, so use wisely.

Passwords
---------
  Every  five levels,  you are  given a
password which will enable you to start
from that level next time you play.
  When you start a game,  you are first
asked for a password.  Type your passw-
ord, or  just any old gobbledygook, and
press fire.  If the password is recogn-
ised,  you'll start at  the appropriate
level, else you'll start at level 0.
  If you wish to save the music to disk
then  type MUSIC as  the password,  but
make sure there is a  formatted disk in
the drive first!  The music is saved in
"Noisetracker" format, which most modu-
le players  should be able  to read and
play.

Special Tiles.
--------------
  Some tiles have special effects.
  There is a brief rundown  of these if
you let the tune  run to the end on the
title screen.  The special tiles are:

+---+
|   |	1 impact tile
| 1 |	If you land on it, it collapses
|   |
+---+

+---+
|   |	3 impact tile
| 3 |	Collapses if you land on it
|   |	twice
+---+

+---+
|   |	Direction forcer
| ^ |	Makes you move in the given
|   |	direction
+---+

+---+
| | |	Jump forcer
| | |	Makes you jump in the given
| V |	direction
+---+

+---+
|+-+|	Wall tile
|| ||	Cannot be landed on, but may be
|+-+|	jumped over
+---+


Have fun,
