JUST LATELY, AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED,
THE ST GAMES MARKET HAS BEEN SADLY 
NEGLECTED BY MAJOR SOFTWARE COMPANIES.
THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING MOST GAMES
FOR THE AMIGA AND HAVE ONLY CONVERTED
A HANDFUL OF TOP SELLING GAMES FOR 
THE ST.

THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS IS THEY ARE 
ONLY INTERESTED IN SUREFIRE PROJECTS
WITH A HIGH PROFIT MARGIN.  ALTHOUGH A
FEW ST GAMES SELL IN THE REGION OF
10,000 TO 20,000 THEY FEEL THE TIME 
SPENT ON CONVERTING WOULD BE TO BETTER
USE CHURNING OUT MORE AMIGA GAMES WHICH
USUALLY SELL 2-3 TIMES AS MANY COPIES 
AS ST GAMES.  

THIS IS WHERE SHAREWARE COMES TO 
THE RESCUE!

OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE HAVE PUT
OUR PC'S TO ONE SIDE AND DECIDED TO
DEVELOP A GAME FOR THE ST.  THIS IS OUR
TESTER FOR THE MARKET AND IF IT PROVES
SUCCESSFUL WE WILL BE DEVELOPING HEAPS
MORE GAMES FOR THE ST.

JUST RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN WRITING
NUMEROUS  MACHINE CODE SUBROUTINES
FOR THE ST WHICH INCLUDE FINE 8 WAY
SCROLLING,HQ SAMPLE PLAYER,FAST
SPRITE DRAWING,HBL'S,ECT ECT
WHAT THIS ADDS UP TO IS COMMERCIAL
QUALITY GAMES WHICH WE WILL MAKE 
AVAILABLE ON THE SHAREWARE MARKET.  SO
SUPPORT US AND YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING
THE FUTURE OF QUALITY AFFORDABLE ST
GAMES!
