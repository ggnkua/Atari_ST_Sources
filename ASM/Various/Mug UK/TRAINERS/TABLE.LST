Title:  Try these out for yourself ....
        
Some of these may look a bit long-winded, but I have altered them so that
they all alter on a byte or word basis, no longword alterations have been
included.  You might also notice that some of the alterations deviate
a bit from my article, this is mainly due to the era in which they were
'designed' and my (still) limited 68000 was very much to blame.  Why not
improve on them yourselves ?

As far as I am aware, all the programs I have listed below are (or were)
public domain and shareware.  If any licenceware titles appear in the list
then I apologise for being so inconsiderate !
