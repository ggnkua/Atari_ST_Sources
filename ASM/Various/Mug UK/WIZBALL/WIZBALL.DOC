For many years, Wiz and his fantastic cat lived happily in 
brightly coloured Wizworld. All was not well however as a 
malevolent force had discovered the vista and intended to stamp 
out brilliance once and for all.
The evil Zark and his horrible sprites have moved in to eliminate 
the spectrum and render all the landscapes drab and grey.
So jump in your transporter and, with the help of your faithful 
servant Catelite, restore Wizworld to it's former glory.

                         GAME PLAY

The landscapes of wizworld are comprised of three colours each. 
Your objective is to restore these original colours by shooting 
the red, green and blue colour bubbles and using the cat to 
collect the droplets. Droplets will be stored in the cauldrons at 
the bottom of the screen, until such time as you have enough of 
each colour to make the target colour displayed in the cauldron 
at the far right.
In the three levels that have aliens on:one has red, one has 
green and one has blue. It is therefore necessary to move between 
the three levels using the tunnels to collect all three colours.
To complete a level you must colour in all three shades of grey-
darkest first. After each type of colour is completed there is a 
bonus stage.

                          ICONS

When certain aliens are killed they will deposit a green pearl 
which will remain stationary on the screen. If Wizball passes 
over this pearl and picks it up, the first Icon on the top of the 
screen will glow to indicate this option is now available 
(selected by wiggling joystick). Collect more pearls for other 
options.

                         DROPLETS

Sometimes droplets of a different colour will be produced by 
the bubbles. These are as follows:
WHITE    - will award an extra Wiz life.

GREY     - awards you 128 cat lives (you lose your cat if hits 
a baddie !!!!!!).

MAGENTA  - mutant cat. screeches around the screen until it is 
killed.

BLACKOUT - landscapes go black until a certain number of baddies 
are killed.

                         HINTS AND TIPS

* level 4 cannot be entered until level 1 is completed, likewise 
level 5 cannot be entered until level 2 is completed.

* there can never be more than 3 landscapes occupied by aliens 
and when you complete a landscape, all aliens disappear from it
(except on level 8)

* near to all tubes are arrows indicating whether the tube will 
take you up or down a level (the level you are on is shown at the 
bottom of the screen ).
