			     AUTOMATION 2.3 PACKER

So Automation were kind (or careless) and let their packer out...

Unfortunately, the spread version comes without any source codes or docs
whatsoever, so we at The Pompey Pirates thought we'd rectify this situation.
If you lot at Automation don't like us doing this, please go and complain to
your local MP.


The Packer
~~~~~~~~~~
	Double click PACK2_31.PRG... options displayed are...
1.	PACK/DEPACK PROGRAM
	Select a PRG, TOS, APP or TTP file and if it was already packed with
	this packer, it will be depacked. Then select a name to save it under
	and it is saved in it's unpacked form.
	If the file you select hasn't been packed, then select the amount of
	compression you want (on a scale from F1-crap to F10-good), sit back
	and wait, and then select the name to save under.

2.	PACK/DEPACK DATA FILE
	Just as for programs, but obviously, it will stay a data file!

3.	MULTI-PACKER MENU
	Leads you to...
	1.	MULTI-PACK ALL
		Which will pack all the files it can find in the current
		directory, and pack them as program files if they are
		programs.
	2.	MULTI-PACK (NO PRGS)
		Which will pack all the files in the current directory,
		EXCLUDING the executable programs.
	Note: with both these, only the CURRENT directory is searched. So
	copy the packer into the directory with all the files that need to
	be packed, otherwise it won't find the correct files!

4.	PACK DATA FILE (OFFSET)
	No, not offset as in the ancient Jek packer (happy memories...).
	Offset as in, miss a bit at the start out. Often games will load
	a file in little bits... e.g. with a DEGAS PI1 file, it might load
	the first 34 bytes (the colors and res info), and then load the
	remaining 32000 bytes of pic info. Now if you just packed that PI1
	file as normal, it would not depack correctly, if at all. So you
	would pack it with an offset of 34 bytes (hex $22), so enter $22
	for the offset. If you don't understand this, you're a lamer, so
	get lost.

5.	EXIT
	The mere fact that you are reading an explanation of 'EXIT' means
	you are a lamer. Go away.


The Source files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DEPACK.S	This is just the depack code- only for hardened hackers
		who know how to use it.

AUTO23.S	This is the Auto-depack code- I think I'll explain this.
		If you pack a PRG, you're fine- it'll run without any
		other mucking about. But what if you pack some data files
		to go along with it? You've had it unless you fancy trying
		to get the depack code in there somehow. This is where the
		auto-depack comes in. It takes over the TRAP #1 vector,
		and whenevr a packed file is read in, it automatically
		depacks it, so your problems are over!

Note: don't expect everything you pack to work. A lot of programs will use
a single file which is really a collection of smaller ones- so when you
pack it, you mess up the positions of each little file within the large
one, and everything dies on you. As yet, we haven't found a practical
solution to this- but we're working on it!

Another note: don't expect speed from this packer. If you select F1 for
crap compression, then things will zip along, but if you select F10 for
good compression, things will be very slow indeed. This is the same with
all packers to a certain extent (our new Pompey Packer v1 is faster and
in early tests is beating Automation 2.3... ha ha). To go for more average
speed/compression, hit the function keys between F1 and F10 (just thought
I'd tell you that in case we have some mentally retarded people out there).


The Egotrip
~~~~~~~~~~~
Please note Automation: PACK2_31.PRG is 4220 bytes long with our packer...
even when 2.3 is on maximum compression, it can only get it down to 4562
bytes. So UP YOURS to 'The Law'!

Docs and hacking by The Alien... hope you find this lot useful!
