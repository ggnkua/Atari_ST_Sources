Synthetic Delights by MUG U.K(tm) - March 1995

A small (!) demo which features 120 different
modules for you to listen to.  Written in GFA
BASIC with a little help from Terry King's
'Spriteworks 2' assembly extension !

Also has a module extraction utility to help
remove any favourite modules from link-file.
