sounds.
       Most of 1st Guide's functionnalities are hidden because they
can be activated only with keyboard shortcuts. They also are not
described in basical documentation (1STGUIDE.TXT), but in a other one
which stands in GUIDHELP.ZIP(notincludedinthepackage).

       So here is a list of functionnalities :

     ‰1 - Moving within hypertext€

„Tab       : €select next keyword.
„shift Tab : €select previous keyword.
„Help      : €read helps related to selected keyword in the current window.
„Return    : €read helps related to selected keyword in another window.
„Undo/Esc : €come back to the text where the keyword has been activated.

It's also possible to select a keyword by pressing its first letters.

      ‰2 - Choosing a help file€

„control O : €open a new window after having loaded a new help file.
„control D : €load a new help file in the current window.

      ‰3 - Windows manipulations€

„control U : €close topped window.
„control Q : €close all windows.
„control F : €fill the screen with the current window, or reset it to its
            previous size.
„control W : €cycle windows.

„ClrHome   : €come back to the beginning of the help, or to the end if shift
            has been pressed.
„Insert    : €scroll window to the left, or to the right if shift has been
            pressed.

     ‰4 - Other remarks€

There is for each kind of window (Text, sound, picture) a pop-up menu
which can be reached by clicking into the window. It allows to set up
several parameters.
There are other fonctionnalities which has not been described.
