     The title of this small program and assembly source code is rather
grandiose for what it does.  It simply displays on the screen the post-
mortem dump information after a system crash (and reset if necessary).
The dump area looks like this:

	$380	proc_lives	= $12345678 if system crashed
	$384	proc_dregs	= saved d0-d7
	$3A4    proc_aregs	= saved a0-a6, supervisor a7 (ssp)
	$3C4    proc_enum	= 1st byte is exception # of crash
	$3C8    proc_usp	= saved user a7 (usp)
	$3CC    proc-stk	= 16 words popped from stack (ssp)

See * A Hitchhiker's Guide to the BIOS * pp. 38-39 in the Developer's
Kit from Atari for further details.

     The program checks whether a crash has occured; if not, it tells you
and exits.  If so, it displays the crash number and a short explanation of
the main exceptions that could occur then gives you the dump information.
Before exiting you can send the information to the printer.  I'm including
CRASH.PRG to let you test AUTOPSY with lost of pretty bombs.  All CRASH
does is cause a non-fatal exception, and return to the desktop [don't we
hope!!!].

     I offer this simple routine in thanks for the many I have downloaded,
and to illustrate some of the macro possibilities of the Abacus AssemPro.
Feel free to use the routines.  The Binary to Hex (BINHEX_B, BINHEX_L)
routines usually run from a table of character values (dc.b '0123456789ABCDEF),
but I rewrote them so that they could work as macros without accessing anything
in the .DATA segment. SmB.
