THE RAM LOADER
by James Ingram, 1992

I bought Populous 2.

Excellent game.

I have 2 meg.

Oh, dear.

Populous 2 does not utilise
my memory to its full potential.

You'd think that in a game with
just a single disk, the whole
disk could be copied into a 2 meg
machine, and then read from memory.

This is what RAM.PRG will do if you
have 2 meg or more.

Run it either from the desktop,
or from the AUTO folder.

After all data is loaded, it resets
the machine once, to install itself
properly.  After that, drive A will
work as if it was a RAM disk.

I haven't tried it on many games,
but it should work on any single
disk games WHICH ARE IN FILES!!!


Oh - remember ONLY EVER PUT IT
ON A BACKUP of your original
game disk!!!!!!!

To install in the AUTO folder:
Copy everything out of the AUTO
folder.
Put RAM.PRG in
Copy everything else back in again.

Ok?

Happy RAMming...

- Disclaimer -
This proggy should work ok.
But NEVER try it on an original
disk, 'cos I WILL NOT accept
responsibility for 40 quids worth
of mangled disk if you fail!!!

ALWAYS USE A BACKUP!!!
