          Intercepter V1.0
          by James Ingram

Bah!   Out   of   diskspace   again!  
Compress  those files!   Oh  no!   I 
can't compress data files!

Hence Intercepter.  You can compress 
data files using:
     ICE 2.4
     LZH (from the JAMPACKER)
     SPEED packer (the best one)

Then, you run Intercepter.

You  can now load  those  compressed 
files into your program.  Unlike any 
other  program of this type  I  have 
seen,  the  compressed data file  is 
treated exactly like a normal  file.  
It  is decompressed in  memory,  and 
read  from  there  any  time  it  is 
accessed.

The  advantage is that you can  load 
packed files directly into  programs 
like DEGELITE,  which read the  file 
in a bit at a time.

However, this means that you have at 
least  as  much free memory  as  the 
length of the file you want to  use.  
For example,  if you have a 1/2  meg 
machine,  you can't compress a  700K 
file   and   then  read   it   using 
intercepter.  Soz.

This can also lead to some odd error 
messages.   When  you  copy  a  file 
using the desktop, the desktop grabs 
ALL available memory at  once!   The 
file cannot then be decompressed  in 
memory,   and   you  get  an   error 
message.


You  can turn off interceptor  in  2 
ways:

1.   Hold down CONTROL.   Files will 
     no  longer  be  altered   while 
     CONTROL is pressed.

2.   Run  Intercepter   again,   and 
     select the "off" option.

Compressed  files also seem to  have 
their  original  length.   When  you 
look at a Degas file which has  been 
compressed, it still appears to have 
a  length of  32034.   However,  the 
routines which do this (and they ARE 
necessary) can take quite some time.  
Getting  a directory on a disk  with 
more than 20 entries in the  current 
directory can take quite some  time.  
I reccommend,  therefore,  that  you 
hold  down  CONTROL while  in  large 
directories,   or  you'll  be  there 
forever.


Using  Intercepter,   you  can   now 
compress  those  pesky  RSC   files, 
which are sometimes massive.   It is 
very  annoying when you have  got  a 
100K file down to 46K,  and the  RSC 
file is still 40K;  especially  when 
your  disk has only 30K  left!   Now 
you  can just compress it  and  slap 
INTERCEPTER into the AUTO folder!



Usual disclaimer:-
     I have tested it (a bit) and it 
     has worked so far...   But  you 
     use   it  at  your  own   risk!  
     Always  keep  backups  of   any 
     files you compress!
