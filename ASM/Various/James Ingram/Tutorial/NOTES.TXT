NOTES

Some  of the PRG files on this disk are slightly  different  from 
their  source-codes  on the disk.   Instead of using  INCBIN  for 
larger files,  such as pictures,  sprites and .DAT files,  I have 
loaded them.   This is merely to save disk space.   But the  PRGs 
won't run without the files they need, so if you transfer them to 
another disk, you may have to move some data files too.  Also, DO 
NOT  change  the  .DAT files such as the  sine-waves  and  sprite 
positions  on the disk,  as the PRGs expect them to be a  certain 
length.
