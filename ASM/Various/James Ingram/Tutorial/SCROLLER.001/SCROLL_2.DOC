                The Scroll Text II - The Revenge

People  realised that 1 pixel scrolls were just not good  enough.  
Personally,  I  have tried messing around with rotating 2  and  4 
pixels at a time using various techniques.  But it is much easier 
to  go 8 pixels at a time.   Why?   Because that is  exactly  one 
byte,  and you can use a MOVE.B instruction.   This is the method 
employed by SCROLL_2.S  This source code also needs FONT.PI1  and 
INIT.S to function properly.


SCROLL_2  is changed only in the part of the code which does  the 
scrolling.   It is no longer necessary to use a  buffer,  because 
bytes  can be picked up directly from the font picture.   I  have 
left  the  buffer in,  though,  so that as little is  changed  as 
possible in this source code.


The new algorithm for the BYTE scroller is:

FOR 32 lines
{
     FOR 4 planes
     {
          copy old screen to new screen, but 1 byte to the left
          copy 1 byte from buffer to rightmost screen byte
          copy the buffer contents 1 byte to the left

          goto next plane on old screen
          goto next plane on new screen
          goto next plane in buffer
     }

     goto next line on old screen
     goto next line on new screen
     goto next line in buffer
}


And that's it!  Simple, eh?

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
