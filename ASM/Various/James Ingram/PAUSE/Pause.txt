              PAUSE
        by James Ingram, 1992

How often has it happened to you?
You run a .TOS (or even, horror of
horrors a .PRG) file.  Some text is
thrown up on the screen and vanishes
before you can read it.  You'd have
thought that programmers would learn to
use the simple

      move.w  #7,-(a7)
      trap    #1
      addq.l  #2,a7

But No!  They cannot be bothered!

Never mind.  Just install my little
beauty by double clicking (or running
from the AUTO folder) when you're using
that kind of program, and you can
hold down ALTERNATE to read the text!

There is also a function called
AUTO PAUSE.  Hold down the
ALTERNATE and RIGHT SHIFT keys
to toggle it on and off.
When it is on, it will ALWAYS
pause after a program and wait
for a keypress.

Usual disclaimer - I have tested this
program and can find no bugs.  But
if it trashes your disk or messes you
around in any way,  don't sue me!

-- You have been warned --

The disclaimer is just here because
everyone else seems to love them!

The first program you can try PAUSE
with is... PAUSE.PRG!!!


It is designed to run from AUTO
folders, so it has no wait for
a keypress!?!

For the techies:
It's a very simple program.
I have just trapped the etv_term
system variable, which is at $408
Then it's just a matter of using
the trap #13 call number 11.

For AUTO PAUSE I just ask for
a keyboard wait!

For the AUTO PAUSE checker,
I've trapped the TRAP #13 vector
and check for ALT and RIGHT SHIFT.
