THE GINGER BREAD LOADER
  by James Ingram, 1992

So you've got my reset-proof
and booting RAM disk called
RAM_DISK, eh?  And every time
you boot for the first time,
you have to copy all your stuff
across.  Hmmm.....


....Ah ha!  G_BOOT is born!

Slap it in your AUTO folder, AFTER
the ram disk program.

Now create a text file in the ROOT
directory, called BOOTUP.DAT

It looks like this:
~Comment line
'Another comment line
'
'The drive to copy to
D
'
' Files to EXCLUDE from copying
' N.B. NO WILDCARDS ALLOWED!
X G_BOOT.PRG
X RAM_DISK.PRG
'
'
' copy desktop across
DESKTOP.INF
'
' create the AUTO folder on the RAM disk
DIR auto
'
' copy everything AUTO folder
AUTO\*.* AUTO\
'
MONST2.PRG
GENST2.INF
GENST2.PRG
'
' create folder called SOURCE
DIR source
' copy all *.S files into SOURCE directory
*.S SOURCE\
'
' NOTE!!  when making a new folder
' you must type DIR, not "dir".
' UPPER CASE ONLY!!!!!!!


All you clever clogs will notice
that you can use the first line
to pass information to RAM_DISK
by making it ~D800 for an 800K
RAM disk on drive D!



Enjoy.

Updated to VERSION 1.1, April 1993
----------------------------------

You now have the option to exclude
specific files from the copying.
This is done as in the (new) example
above.  The line starts "X "
followed by the filename.  NO
WILDCARDS, and NO PATHNAMES.
Any files of that name found
are automatically skipped.
