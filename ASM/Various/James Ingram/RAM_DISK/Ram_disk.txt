THE GINGER BREAD RAM DISK
  by James Ingram, 1992


How many of you have longed
for a RAM disk?  not many,
as they appear on all magazines
at regular intervals.

Ever wanted a reset proof one?
All the data survives a warm
boot (pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL
or the reset button).

Oh, so you've seen HRAMDSK2.

Well then, how about one that
does all that, but lets you
BOOT from the RAM disk!?!

Yes, folks, you too now have
the ability to run AUTO progs
and accessories from a RAM
disk when you re-boot (perfect
for when you're messing around
with interrupts and timings).

I used to use HRAMDSK2, but
wanted this extra function, so
I wrote me own!  And it works
at 40 degrees, as well!!

RAM_DISK can be run 3 ways:

1) from the desktop.  Enter
   the size and drive manually.

2) from the AUTO folder.  Enter
   the size and drive manually.

3) from the AUTO folder.  Put
   the drive and size in a file
   called "BOOTUP.DAT" in the
   root directory, in the format:

   ~<drive><size>

   e.g.  ~D800 for an 800K disk
         on drive D

The reason I have that "wierd"
form of data file, is that it
will be compatible with G_BOOT,
which is my program for
automatically copying files to
a RAM disk on boot up.
GET IT NOW!!!

Well, that's it, folks.
Enjoy.

This proggy HAS been tested, but
I make no guarantees that it will
work in all situations.  Note that
it will not respond to TRAP #14
reads and you should NEVER try
to format it!!!!!
