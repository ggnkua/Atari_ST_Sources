                                  --------
                            By  M†rten Lindstr”m

 The PC_LINES.PRG program replaces, from  the  system  screen fonts, most of
 the Atari specific characters (Hebrew  etc.  - generally unprintable), with
 IBM LINE GRAPHIC characters, which most  printers  can print and which will
 be usable in ASCII texts for  PCs  etc.  (A few other character changes are
 also made - see below.)

 You can run PC Lines  from  the  Desktop,  or  you  can  put it in the AUTO
 folder, or, with TOS 1.04 or higher, INSTALL it as auto-executable from the
 Desktop  (in  which  case  you   shouldn't   forget  to  save  the  Desktop
 configuration - DESKTOP.INF - afterwards).

 You can turn PC Lines off and on by running it repeatedly.

 PC Lines will permanently take  up  slightly  less  than 8 kb, reserved the
 first time it is run.

 PC_LINES.PRG is freeware  and  can  be  copied  freely  as  long  as  it is
 unchanged and this documentation file is included.


                                  No lines?
                                  ---------

 If the change of the character set  seems  to be only partially effected or
 not at all, here is what you can do:

 - From the Desktop: Just let down a menu dropbox. (Then click it away.)

 - From a program (e.g. Neodesk): Call  up  a dialogue box that makes use of
 the small font (try the left-most 'about ...' menu item)

 - Installation: It appears  that  installation  (with  TOS  1.04+) as auto-
 executable from the Desktop causes a  more  instant font change than if the
 program is placed in the AUTO  folder.  (It  may possibly be even better to
 install it as an auto-executable TOS - rather than GEM - application.)

 NOTE: The above tips stem  from  experience  alone.  I  have really no good
 explanation for why they work the  way  they  do, and you may possibly find
 other methods to enforce the font change.


 As to why the font change at all  CAN  BE delayed, this is because PC Lines
 only uses a 'semi-clean'  method  for  the  font  change.  I.e. there IS no
 DOCUMENTED method, that I know of,  to  change  the system screen fonts, so
 what PC Lines does is to change  a  number of - documented - font pointers,
 and change - cleanly - the Line-A  exception vector to a routine that tries
 to  make  sure  that  everybody  only  will  see  the  new  font  pointers.
 Unfortunately it seems  that  GEM  maintains  non-documented  copies of the
 pointers as well, which means  that  the  font  change may not become fully
 effective immediately after PC Lines has been run.


                             PC Lines characters
                             -------------------

 179-218: Line graphics (various Atari char.s - mostly Hebrew - overwritten)
   254:   Filled square (Atari 'cubed' symbol (superscript 3) overwritten)
   236:   Infinity symbol (copied from Atari 223)  (Atari circular integral)

   155:   o slash, like Protext (from Atari 179) Currency symbol overwritten
   157:   O slash, like Protext (from Atari 178) Yen symbol overwritten

 Modified only slightly:
   158:   German double s - to look more like one, and not Greek beta (#225)
    42:   Asterisk (*) - made smaller (neater) and moved up slightly
   249:   'Big dot' (ù) - centred (moved down) as printed by most printers
   250:   'Small dot' (ú) - centred (moved up) as printed by most printers

 Not changed (but maybe should be?)
    20:   Atari: 'LED style' digit 4   PC/Protext: Paragraph symbol
    21:   Atari: 'LED style' digit 5   PC/Protext: Section mark
 176-178: Atari: various   PC: 'fill graphics'   Protext: letters of its own
 219-223: Atari: various   PC: 'fill graphics'   Protext: letters of its own


 Most of the changes  are  in  order  to  conform  better  to PC and printer
 standard, but 155 and 157 were made  into  o  and O slash (like in Protext)
 just to compensate my Danish and  Norwegian  brothers  for the loss of this
 letter from the Atari character set, where IBM graphic characters overwrite
 it. (155 and 157  are  actually  the  Currency  and  Yen  symbols - on PCs,
 printers and Ataris alike - I hope no-one misses them.)

 The Atari characters replaced  by  the  line  graphics  are, as said above,
 mainly letters in the  Hebrew  alphabet,  but  the slightly more frequently
 used Copyright, Registered and Trade  Mark  symbols  are also there. On the
 other hand these aren't printable  on  most  printers  and could instead be
 written simply as '(c)', '(R)' and  'TM'.  A few modified Latin letters are
 also overwritten, of which most are  not  printable  on my printer at least
 (o slash being the notable exception -  see  above). The Dutch ij letter IS
 printable on my NEC P2200 printer - by  setting it to use a Dutch character
 set - but I don't think it's  printable  on most other dot matrix printers,
 and its not included  in  either  the  ANSI  ('Amiga') or Protext character
 sets. (It would be interesting to hear  from a Dutchman or Belgian how used
 and needed the Atari ij and IJ letters really are.)

 About character 158 you should know  that  it  is on the Atari reserved for
 German double s (though  still  looks  like  Greek  beta),  but  on PCs and
 printers is used for a Pt symbol  (Pesetas).  ST Protext doesn't use 158 at
 all, but converts any 158 into 225  which  it uses for German double s (225
 is Greek beta in the IBM and Atari character sets).

 Character 21 is the section mark  on  PCs,  in Protext and on many printers
 (including my own NEC P2200). Character 20  is the paragraph symbol on PCs,
 in Protext and, I think, on  some  Printers (though not printable on mine).
 Unfortunately 20 and 21 are  in  the  Atari  character  set defined as 'LED
 style' digits (4 and 5),  which,  as  ugly  as  they  are, are used by some
 programs (e.g. Devpack 3). They will  also  be ignored by the normal GEMDOS
 and BIOS character output functions, the  exception being BCONOUT to device
 #5, and they thus will be  invisible  if  the  built in file view option is
 used from the Desktop. (Atari  has  its  section  mark at 221 and paragraph
 symbol at 188, the latter overwritten by line graphics.)


                              'Free' characters
                              -----------------

 Characters 176-178 and 219-223  are  'fill  graphics'  in the IBM character
 set, which probably aren't as useful as  the line graphics. I think most of
 these characters could be considered 'free'.  Protext uses them for its own
 letters.

 Among the Atari characters placed here,  the most important is probably 221
 - the section mark (as just mentioned). (178 is Atari O slash, copied by PC
 Lines to 157; 223 is Atari infinity symbol,  copied to 236; 176 and 177 are
 a and o tilde, I don't know in which language they are used - Portuguese?.)

 I have considered  placing the card  symbols here (hearts, diamonds, clubs,
 spades). At least my own printer is capable of printing the card symbols if
 sent to it as character numbers 3-6.

 Another option would be  to  use  these  'character  slots' for the Protext
 letters. Protext adds, to the modified  Latin  letters of the IBM character
 set, the  letters  thorn  (old  English  'th'  letter)  and  eth  (sounding
 counterpart of  thorn)  (both  still  used  in  Icelandic),  plus  L  slash
 (Polish), L  dot  (Catalan?)  and  'lowercase  i  without  dot'  (Turkish I
 believe). (Not many  printers  can  immediately  print  these  though; most
 Protext printer drivers print them as graphics.)

 Any views are welcome!

                                   O slash
                                   -------

 As mentioned above,  PC  Lines  copies  o  and  O  slash  from  their Atari
 positions at 179 and 178 to their Protext positions 155 and 157. This is to
 keep (lowercase) o slash out of the way of the IBM Line graphics.

 NOTE 1: PC Lines should hopefully also make the corresponding change to any
 keyboard that is equipped with  o/O  slash.  (As I presume Danish/Norwegian
 keyboards are.)

 NOTE 2: If you use Protext  with  PC  Lines  active, then lowercase o slash
 (character 155) will be  a  vertical  line.  This  is  because Protext does
 exactly the same operation as PC Lines does, i.e. it first copies character
 179 to 155 and then changes  179  into  a  vertical line. With a bad result
 when repeated twice. The only solution  that  I  can think of (if you don't
 turn PC  Lines  off  before  entering  Protext)  is  that  you  include the
 following lines in your EXFILE (= file with commands to be auto-executed at
 Protext start-up). If you don't have an EXFILE you can create one from just
 the following lines, and install it with CONFIG:

 sym 155 0 0 0 0 1 61 &7E &66 &6E &7E &76 &66 &7E &BC &80 0
 sym 155 0 2 60 &6E &76 &66 60 64

 (The above Protext commands will  define  lowercase  o slash characters, 16
 and 8 pixels high, for character slot #155)


                               How to print it
                               ---------------

 This part is, of course,  essential,  since  one strong motive for changing
 the ST character set was to make  it correspond better to the character set
 of most printers.

 All examples of control codes given  are  for standard dot matrix printers.
 They may also work for laser or  inkjet printers (if the printer emulates a
 dot matrix printer) but will not work for daisy wheel!

 I assume that you already have a  working printer driver to start from (for
 use with First Word or  some  other word-processor/text-editor). Should you
 run into any serious difficulties I can  only refer you to your printer and
 word-processor manuals.


 1) THE LINE GRAPHICS

 should in most cases automatically come out right on your printer, IF it is
 equipped with the IBM character set that is.

 If they don't (and you  have  an  IBM-compatible printer) there is probably
 some way (DIP switches or otherwise) to  - directly on the printer - change
 the default setting ("IBM" <->  "Epson").  The  other  method is to include
 certain control codes in the initiating  sequence,  that you should be able
 to define with your word-processor, to be  sent to the printer at the start
 of each printed document.

  .----------------------------. .----------------------------------------.
  | code to select 'IBM mode': | | code to make IBM characters printable: |
  |                            | |    (not treated as control codes)      |
  |                            | |                                        |
  |               ESC "t" 1    | |                       ESC "6"          |
  |   in decimal:  27 116 1    | |          in decimal:   27 54           |
  |       in hex:  1B  74 1    | |              in hex:   1B 36           |
  '----------------------------' '----------------------------------------'

 The second code may possibly not be needed at all (or it may even be needed
 each time an 'IBM character' - characters 128-254 - is printed).


     Beware that some slightly  older  printers  may  lose  their ability to
     print in italics style when in IBM mode.

     Also,  the  ability  to   print   'international'  (i.e.  non-American)
     characters may in some cases  be  adversely  affected, when the printer
     driver file contains explicit definitions for the characters.

     The solution to these problems, when they  occur, is to insert the 'IBM
     off' and 'IBM on' codes at the appropriate places in the printer driver
     file (in the character definitions and/or italics codes)

     The 'IBM off' code is  ESC "t" 0  (dec: 27 116 0 /hex: 1B 74 0)
     (compare with 'IBM on' above)


 2) O SLASH (Danish/Norwegian)

 Lowercase o slash has been  moved  from  179  to  155  (hex:  B3 to 9B) and
 uppercase O slash from 178  to  157  (hex:  B2  to 9D) so the corresponding
 change has to be done in any printer driver file.
 (If defined in character form, '³' should be changed to '›' and '²' to '')

 If it is of any  further  help,  the  character definitions you are looking
 for, will for a dot matrix printer probably look something like
     27 "R" 4 124
     27 "R" 4 92
 (though on my NEC, IBM mode in addition  has to be turned off to make these
 sequences work - see note above)

                               Technical notes
                               ---------------

 PC Lines installs a new Line A exception with XBRA ID: 'PCLn'.
 This will just jump through to the old Line A exception, except when Line A
 Init ($A000) has been called.
 Any call of Line A Init is intercepted  and  A1 set to point to a new table
 of font pointers (A0, D0 and  A2  get  their  usual Line A Init values). In
 addition a  check  is  made  of  whether  the  'current  font  pointer' (at
 -906(A0)) points below the PC  Lines  area  or  to  within ROM. If so, this
 pointer plus the  other  font  pointers  within  the  Line  A variables are
 changed.

 PC Lines changes the following pointers within the Line A variables:

 OFFSET    POINTER TO
  -906: -> header for current font
  -460: -> header for default (system) font (8x8 or 8x16)
  -456: -> header for 6x6 font
  -452: -> header for 8x8 font
   -22: -> data for system font

 The amount of memory reserved by PC_LINES  is less than 8 kb (slightly more
 if keyboard includes Danish/Norwegian o slash)  and is almost entirely used
 by modifiable RAM-copies of the original ROM-fonts.

 The installation code itself is abandoned  when  it has completed its task,
 and thus does not permanently take up any memory.
