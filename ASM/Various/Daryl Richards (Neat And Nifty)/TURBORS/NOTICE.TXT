Notice

This public domain release is not the complete TurboRS package. 
TurboRS itself is a hardware upgrade for the Atari ST line of
computers which boosts the maximum baud rate of the ST serial
port (TT Modem1) to 115200 baud.  This release is meant to
demonstrate TurboRS functionality, and also to provide a
reference for programmers who wish to support it.  The TurboRS
hardware is required to use the extended baud rates supported by
this package.

If you are interested in purchasing the full TurboRS package,
please print out and complete ORDER.FRM included with this
release.  Please enclose a certified cheque or money order
