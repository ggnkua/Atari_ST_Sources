GIFVIEW is GIFcolor & GIFscale : Two Very Fast GIF Viewers For Color
Systems by Robert Barnhardt & Robert Steger (dated Nov., 1990).  One
program uses the 16 most popular colors in the image to reproduce the
.GIF while the other maps the image to gray and tinted scales.  These
programs are FAST (5 to 10 times faster than many other .GIF viewers (and
they're small (only 3K each!).  They can be installed as an application
so you can just click on a .GIF file and view it!  Docs included and
assembly source code included.  Works even on a 512K machine. 87K
uncompressed.
