     The source files in this archive are not guaranteed to work with every
   GIF picture - they won't.  They are not claimed to be complete in any
   way, including their implementation of the GIF standard.  This source
   code is being released on request, and it should be considered out of
   date, as a new composite version of the viewers is nearing completion.
   The source code for QuickGIF2, as it shall be called, will be released
   shortly after the program is.

     Concerning these source files: I have a nasty habit of sprinkling my
   source code with foul language in labels, variables, and comments. I've
   spent a good hour and a half cleaning them up, but I can't guarantee
   they're filth-free.  If you run across anything offending, I'm sorry,
   and I hope you'll forgive me.

     Finally, the GFA BASIC and C versions of these viewers (yes, really!)
   still lurk on my disks, and if anyone wants any of THAT source for its
   meagre educational value, just scream.  Otherwise, good riddance to bad
   rubbish, and I won't waste my time doing sanitary engineer duties.
