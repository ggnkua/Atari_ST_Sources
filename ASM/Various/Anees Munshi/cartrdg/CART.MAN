     The Atari ST's 128 Kbyte read-only cartridge port can be
     transformed into a 64 Kbyte read/write port by using this cir-
     cuit. Writing to this port is slower than reading it by a factor
     of two, approximately. It can be written to at a speed of
     76 Kilowords per second.

          This interface can be built by using only three chips, two
     AS-TTLs and a PAL -- a total parts cost of less than $15.

     The ST brings out 15 address lines (A1-A15),  16 data lines (d0-
     D15) /LDS,[*] /UDS, /AS, /ROM4 and /ROM3.

          Of these signals, /UDS, /LDS, and /AS have the same meaning
     as they as they do for a 68000 CPU. A1-A15 are the least signifi-
     cant 15 address lines. D0-D15 are connected internally to the
     ST's data-bus. /ROM3 and /ROM4 are generated by the MMU and are
     output signals which tell the external hardware which of the two
     banks is being addressed. /ROM4 is activated when the 68000 tries
     to read address 0xfa0000-0xfaffff. /ROM3 is activated when the
     68000 tries to read address 0xfb0000-0xfbffff. (Note that the
     names of these signals are counterintuitive; ie. they have been
     correctly written above.)



     2.  _C_a_v_e_a_t_s

          Any and all hardware connected to this modified port must be
     fast -- fast enough to run with no wait-states and fast enough to
     tolerate the decoding delays introduced by this circuit. I've
     used 200ns static RAM chips without any trouble.

          It is advisable to use /ROM4 to time any external hardware
     you build (in preference to /AS), since /ROM4 contains the neces-
     sary delay to ensure the addresses are stable when it is
     activated. (At least this is what I assumed, and it worked.)

          The data for write operations is produced by the two AS-TTL
     latches[*] used in the circuit (see below.)

      i.  The PAL contains an asynchronous finite state machine. When
          the upper bank (address 0xfbxxxx) is read, the PAL manufac-
          tures an A0 (based on the state of /UDS and /LDS) and sup-
          plies this to U1. At the end of the read cycle, U1 and U2
          are clocked to latch the least significant 16 address bits
          into the PAL.

     ii.  Subsequently, when the lower bank is read (address
          0xfaxxxx), the latched address (which was latched in step 1)
          is supplied as data and /PWE (the write-enable signal) is
          activated (it goes low). /ROM4 active should tell the exter-
          nal hardware that it is being addressed, and /PWE active
          should tell it that this is a write-cycle.  As an interest-
          ing  side-effect of this design, the data word written out
          is read back by the 68000 (you can use this fact to debug
          the interface!)

     iii. Reads to the upper bank will return garbage unless some ROM
          is present there. Multiple successive reads to this bank
          will not be harmful (ie. they will not confuse the state-
          machine) and the latest address will be latched preparation
          for a read to the lower bank.

               Note that if you put RAM in the upper-bank you will not
          be able to write to it. Connecting the /PWE line to such RAM
          will have no effect. Putting a ROM in this address space
          should not create any problems (although I haven't tried
          this).

     Example:

          To write data 0xcd01 to address 0x3bc0 in the lower bank,
     the following steps are performed.


             step1.  read byte at address 0xfbcd01   (0xfb0000+data)
             step2.  read word to address 0xfa3bc0   (0xfa0000+addr)









     _________________________________________________________________
     [*] I used AS374s, you can use AS or FAST. High speed chips are
         necessary so that delays from /OE (latch output-enable) to
         valid data are not critical. You could possibly get away with
         ALSTTL, but I haven't tried this.

     The schematic should help in this department.  Constructing this
     gadget is easy and cheap. The hardest part might be trying to
     find a connector for this port. You can get one from

          Douglas Electronics,
          718 Marina Blvd.,
          San Leandro, Calif
          94577

          1-415-483-8770

          (part number 33-DE-40. $10.00 per piece)[*]

     Another problem you might face is getting the PAL programmed.  If
     you don't know of a way to get the PAL programmed, you could use
     discrete logic chips to build the state machine.

          The pin-outs given in the User's guide are CORRECT. The
     pin-outs given in the "Internals" book are WRONG.  Follow the
     schematic. You can get the pin-outs for the '374s from an ASTTL
     or FAST databook. The PAL16L8's pin-outs are given below.

         a number of others have purchased these connectors from them.

     Legend:

     A preceding slash implies an active-low signal.
     NC implies no-contact (nothing should be connected to these pins.)
     (i) indicates that the signal is an input.
     (o) indicates that the signal is an output.
     (A) implies that the signal comes from/goes to the Atari cart. port.
     (u1) implies that the signal goes to U1, the least-significant
             latch.
     (u2) implies that the signal goes to U2, the most-significant
             latch.
     (ex) implies that the signal goes to any external hardware connected
             such as a ram-disk.
