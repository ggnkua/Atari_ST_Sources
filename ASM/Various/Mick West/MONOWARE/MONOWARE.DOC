            MONO EMULATOR
  
  One of the few problems with the 
 ST is it's inability to display all 
  three graphics modes on a normal 
 monitor or TV. The High resolution 
 monochrome display usually needs a 
special monitor. Some software - such
as 'Signum' and 'PCB Designer' - only
 works in monochrome mode so if you 
   do not a have the monitor then 
 you can not use the software. This 
small program provides a solution to 
this. The Mono Emulator makes the ST 
   run in mono mode and provide a 
   picture which is suitible for a 
 normal monitor or TV. With the loss 
of 33K of memory and a little speed.

To use it assemble the program into a 
 file called MONO.PRG. Then you just 
 load the program by double clicking 
 it on the desktop. You will then be 
asked to enter a speed from 10 to 80. 
This is the speed at which the screen 
  is updated. A low speed will give 
faster execution of programs - but a 
 slowly updated display - leading to 
jerky movement of the mouse cursor. A 
  higher speed will give a smoother 
 display but will slow the programs 
   down by a noticable amount. The 
lowest speed is 10 this slows the ST 
down by just 10%. The highest speed 80
 slows it by 90% and the default 40
               by 35%.  

 The default setting is ok for most 
uses. When you have entered the speed 
the computer will reset and then will 
  restart as if it is attached to a 
   monochrome monitor. The desktop  
  will be modified accordingly with 
small icons on a grey background. You 
will now be able to load and run any  
monochrome only programs without any 
  problems. You will probably get a 
  better picture using a black and 
 white TV rather than a colour one.   
    
 Programs that have been tested with 
              this are:

     Signum         (mono only)
     PCB Designer   (mono only)
    Degas Elite    (in mono mode)
    Megaroids      (in mono mode)
    The Pawn       (in mono mode)
    Shanghi        (in mono mode)

     
I have not yet come across a program 
which works in mono mode that will not 
       work with this program.

    The program was written using 
   Hisoft's Devpak ST - it should 
  work on any assembler. You do not 
    need to type in the comments.
     
  You can give away copies of this 
  program to anybody. Thanks a lot.
