ALW2 is Clay Walnum's "The Assembly Language Workshop, Vol. 2.  Volume
One was on paper, volume 2 is on disk and released as Shareware.
There are five chapters in this book, each chapter being a combination
of text, source code and executable code for that chapter's programs,
and sometimes .PC3 files containing that chapter's illustrations.  The
source code illustrations contain versions for both Hisoft's DevPac2
assembler and Atari's MadMac assembler.  This version of the ALW can
help you learn to program the AES and VDI, including such topics as
starting and ending a GEM application, adding menus to a window,
designing and controlling dialog boxes, using the VDI to draw shapes
on-screen, and more.
