Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I got my C-64 back in 84-85 (I cannot remeber),.. I only played games then,     didn't even bother to lurke into the 64 basic,... I only enjoyed this for a     couple of years, so in 1990 I got my first ST (and there you have it!!!)
