*   This file contains no keyboard mapping tables!

               output 'Standard.CKB'

* default output mode is 'BASIC' which is simple binary without any header
*
               default 6

* These defines are taken from CKBD.H

*
* This is the CKB file header
*
* 1. LONG magic:
id:            dc.b "CKBD"

*
* 2. The name of the table. Maximum 12 chars, must be padded with null bytes
*    to exactly 12 bytes.
*                   '123456789012'
name:          dc.b 'Standard GER' ; Name: exakt 12 Zeichen!!

*
* 3. The offsets to the keyboard mapping and compose tables. If a given table
*    is not present it's offset must be zero.
*
unshift_offset:dc.w 0			;unshift-id  if used
shift_offset:  dc.w 0			;shift-id    if used
caps_offset:   dc.w 0			;caps-id     if used
compose_offset:dc.w compose-id

*
* 4. Setup-Words. These words are only read out if the table is autoloaded by
*    CKBD. The magic $BAD0 in the first word is used to indicate that there are
*    more configuration words to follow.
*
compose_mode:  dc.w $0BAD|DEC_MODE|ORDERINDIFF|ON

*
* 5. more config words (not read by older versions of ckbd.prg).
*
