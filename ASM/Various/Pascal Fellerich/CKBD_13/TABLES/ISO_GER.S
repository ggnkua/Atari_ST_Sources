*
* This is the assembler source for an ISO compose table for CKBD
*   The compose sequences in this table have been set up accordingly with
*   DEC's VTxxx compose schemes. Reference was the DEC multinational character
*   set, so this table can be used in conjunction with terminal programs like
*   UNITERM or CONNECT which have the corresponding character set.
*
*   This table was designed for the german keyboard layout!
*
* Assembler: TurboAss 1.7.x

* Ω2/1992, 3/1994 by P. Fellerich

* 1. LONG magic:
id:            dc.b "CKBD"

*
* 2. The name of the table. Maximum 12 chars, must be padded with null bytes
*    to exactly 12 bytes.

*
* 3. The offsets to the keyboard mapping and compose tables. If a given table
*    is not present it's offset must be zero.
*

caps_offset:   dc.w caps-id

*
* 4. Setup-Words. These words are only read out if the table is autoloaded by
*    CKBD. The magic $BAD0 in the first word is used to indicate that there are
*    more configuration words to follow.
