18.03.95, 1.31
--------------

- As I do not have an ST any more, and as PEACEBUG has been translated with
  another assembler since V1.30, two bugs occured because of unaligned memory
  accesses (PEACEBUG and PBUGCONF). It definitely runs now again on STs.
- A program loaded with Lexecute can now be interrupted by Shift-Shift. This is
  useful as calling the debugger by keyboard normally interrupts not the program
  but uninteresting OS routines.
- The problems with the RSD considering parsing (e.g. "l ._sysbase+1" did not
  work) are solved. Now you can use the RSD's symbols as the other ones.
- The print routine has become quite a bit faster especially on high
  resolutions.
- The utilities has been rewritten with PASM. They are now normal ascii files
  instead of src files (TURBOASS).
- There are now three new routines included in the debugger's interface. They
  allow you to turn on trace modes without first calling the debugger. Further
  details can be found in the manual, chapter "Interface, Cookie Entry".
- FIND, HUNT, COMPARE and ASCFIND do now print any hit immediately and do not
  wait until enough hits have occured to print a whole line.
- The jumpin message is not printed inversly any longer.
- A new symbol is created if a program is loaded by Lexecute: BP. It contains
  the basepage's address.
- The command Free crashed under MagiC because MagiC allows to allocate memory
  blocks with a length of zero bytes. This is fixed.
- The mouse wasn't drawn correctly in F030 true color.
- PBUGCONF: the redraw wasn't correctly under certain circumstances.
- PBUGCONF: the windows are now always opened with fully visible workspace if
  this is possible.


28.02.95, 1.30
--------------

There are too many changes to list them all. PEACEBUG has been almost totally
rewritten. Many Bugfixes, many small changes. Here are the most important ones:
- Totally new manual as ST-GUIDE hypertext (for PEACEBUG and PBUGCONF).
- F030 True Color is supported now.
- Devpac is supported now --> read the manual.
- Unfortunately the English manual isn't finished yet.
If anyone has the time to write a FAQ, please contact me! It would be cool if
you ask the questions, I could give the answers by myself.
If anyone has the time to correct the English manuals, please contact me!


25.05.94, 1.21
--------------

- PEACEBUG is now supported by SYSMON:
  - They share the screen in TT-High, that means, they need 153600 Bytes less
    memory.
  - The debug modes I (IN) and O (OUT) are supported by the two programs (look
    up the manual of SYSMON).
  - PEACEBUG can be called from SYSMON by pressing shift-left help.
  Note: You need at least SYSMON Version 1.0.9, 24.04.1994 and it has to be
  started after PEACEBUG.
  There seem to be still some problems, if PEACEBUG, TEMPLMON and SYSMON are
  installed all together and you try to call PEACEBUG by shift-left help. In
  this case, TEMPLMON seems to do some strange things. I hope this will be fixed
  in newer version.
- Again the command Xbra has a new syntax:
  Xbra [FirstVector][,Lastvector][,ID]
  For further information please consult the PEACEBUG manual.
- PEACEBUG is now adapted to the Falcon video hardware apart from the 4 colour
  falcon mode. Thanks a lot to SPIFF.
- The default configuration considering the vectors has changes. Some vectors
  are not installed any more (this can be changed naturally).
- F4-GoTraps: This function has now been implemented totally different. The
  consequence is, that it works now also under any multitasking OS.
- CALL_DEBUGGER is now called CALL_DEBUGGER_1, because there is a new routine
  CALL_DEBUGGER_2. The first one does set all 2 or 3 stackpointers to own memory
  areas, the second one does not touch any of the registers. More details are to
  be found in the PEACEBUG manual, chapter "Interface".
- There is a new parameter _PLANES (screen interface). It's already supported by
  PBUGCONF. For further information consult the PEACEBUG manual, chapter
  "Interface".
- PBUGCONF: Control w and Control u have changed their functionality (according
  to the Atari guidelines). The closer of the window does not discard the
  changes any more but accepts them.
- When loading or lexecuting a file, not the whole screen is overwritten any
  more but only 16 lines.
- There is now a special PEACEBUG version for coders. This version runs now by
  default in the so-called cheat mode. This mode has been documented since
  V1.10. Further details can be found in this file some lines below. You can
  naturally turn of cheat mode as the versions are actually identical apart from
  the default for he cheat flag.


25.01.94, 1.19
--------------

- Now there are English versions of WINDOW and PBUGCONF, including English
  manuals.
- If the Resident Symbol Driver is installed, PEACEBUG adds the name of the
  program to the listing if the line address is inside the program (BASEPAGE
  included):
  $01057536>! [GEMRAM]   RTS                                         ; 4E75
  As you can see the name is printed without extension. If there is a label,
  then the label is printed instead of the name.
  This is only suppressed if SYMBOL_FLAG is zero (see readme PEACEBUG, chapter
  "Interface, Parameter").
- The symbol handling has changed totally. PEACEBUG searches now in all symbol
  tables (PEACEBUG.SYM, program symbol tabel, RSD). Opcodes: it searches now
  symbols only for all branches (bra, jmp, dbcc, fbcc...) and absolute short and
  absolute long addressing modes. One of the effects is that you don't need
  SYMBOL.SMB (RSD) any more.
- Within the debugger fetching a reset can now be turned off. You can choose
  between fetching always, once a second and never. Once a second means, that if
  you reset twice within a second then the computer is reseted otherwise not.
  PBUGCONF is already adapted to this feature, you can configure this in the
  dialog "Flags", vector "Reset".
- Info did print some wrong stuff (program length, text length debugger).
- Up to now the assembler did not translate lines inside the debugger if there
  was a * before the opcode. Now it accepts this.
- Since V1.10 PEACEBUG could be called by pressing only shift keys. This was
  also supported by PBUGCONF up to the moment I deleted 4 lines source code,
  because I did not see any sense in them...
- The whole output of the command Help is in English now.
- When PEACEBUG is called, it resets now the keyboard acia.
- The possibility to move the cursor freely on the screen is removed now. F18
  is now the key to toggle between insert- and overwritemode. F19 and F20 have
  the same function --> Go PC.
  The flag "cursor_bound" of the cookie interface has no effect any more.
- As F20 is free now (but has nevertheless the same function as before), I
  implemented a clock. Depending on the computer it runs on, it shows the time
  taken directly from the keyboard processor or from the real time clock (Mega
  ST and TT).
- The PC at the beginning of a line is now highlighted.
- On some TOS versions Alternate+Num did not work to enter the asciicode of a
  char.
- I implemented a new command: Observe [[Address][,Bytes]|-|+]. It gives you the
  possibillity to observe memory. If the content of the observed memory has
  changed PEACEBUG will pop up and tell you this. It uses the 200HZ timer to
  check the memory.
- PEACEBUG does not check the _CPU and _FPU Cookie any more but uses always its
  own test routine.
- The routine to test the FPU did only recognize a SFP004 FPU, this is fixed.
- FNOP wasn't translated correctly by the disassembler as well as by the
  assembler.
- PTEST is again translated correctly by the disassembler and the assembler.
- If PEACEBUG catches a reset and if the program segment is damaged then it does
  not selfterminate any more, but just declares that it is damaged.
- If you trace with F11-Tnosubs, then the debugger will not set a breakpoint
  after a jsr/bsr any more to skip the subroutine. Also if you trace with F2-Do
  PC and the opcode is a jsr/bsr it won't set a breakpoint any more.
- Double clicking with the left mouse button on an address lists from this
  address.
- Up to now the division, the multiplication and the modulo functions were
  unsigned. E.g. .10/-2 did not even give the correct result but zero. From now
  on this is -5. The modulo function works exactly like the one of the CPU:
  "The sign of the remainder is the same as the sign of the dividend."
  [Motorola: M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE MANUAL].
- The command ? shortens now the printed numbers, e.g. instead of $0000FFFF it
  prints $FFFF. If the number is negative then it prints additionally the
  negative value, e.g. ? -1:
  $FFFFFFFF .4294967295 %11111111111111111111111111111111 o37777777777 "...."
  -$1 -.1
- If a file is loaded then it is listed from the first address but the PC is not
  set to this address.
- PBUGCONF: the main menu has now shortcuts.
- PBUGCONF: control u closes now the top window.
- PBUGCONF: control q closes now all windows and quits the program. Before it
  closed only the top window.
- WINDOW: cannot be moved out of the screen any more with Winx 2.1.


07.10.93, 1.13
--------------

- PEACEBUG turns now the caches and burstmode on, if a reset occurs within the
  the debugger and if a MC68030 is inside.
- I had to add an $ to each number in PEACEBUG.SYM, because the debugger can
  have another default base for numbers than 16. Up to now you could choose this
  base from 2 to 16. From now on it's 2 to 36 (because 0-9,A-Z are 36 chars).
- Cheatmode could be toggled also when the debugger was not active.
- The slowmotion function is much better now. The delay is now quite constant
  for most of the activities. Just try it...
- Opcodes with Condition Code lo (=cs) could not be translated.
- PBUGCONF is now able to configure 10 debuggers at the same time. Up to now you
  could switch between config- and patchmode in the main menue. Now you switch
  from patchmode to PEACEBUG 0 till PEACEBUG 9 and back to patchmode. The order
  of the debuggers found, is the same order, they are installed in the cookie
  jar.
- PBUGCONF calls now any debugger routine in supervisor mode.
- PBUGCONF didn't handle objects f_text correctly if they contained 0.
- PBUGCONF tested the coordinates of a window if they fit into the desktop, but
  it forgot to adapt the coordinates of the dialog then.
- Slave is now a TSR.


26.05.93, 1.12
--------------

- The debugger could crash when it installed its routines with SETEXC, because
  it did not set the interrupt mask to 7 --> an interrupt could occur before the
  routines were properly linked. This happended e.g. if sysmon was active, as
  sysmon does delay OS calls.
- The debugger sometimes called MFREE with Blockadress 0. As this seems to be a
  problem for the resident symbol driver (it did not find the symbols any more),
  I will not do this any more.
- With F17 you could tell the debugger to use or not to use symbols. Now you can
  also tell it to use its own symbol table but not the one of the resident sym-
  bol driver. As a consequence the variable SYMBOL_FLAG can have a third value.
  Symbol-, SYMBOL_FLAG=0: no symbols are used
  Symbol+, SYMBOL_FLAG=-1: all symbols are used
  Symbol*, SYMBOL_FLAG=1: only the debugger's symbols are used.
- If PEACEBUG catched a reset, that occured not within the debugger, it happened
  that it lost the program's screen registers. This is fixed.
- There is the new command Programs, which gives you a list of all started prog-
  rams and some additional stuff. It is only available if the resident symbol
  driver is installed.
- The key help has now the same effect as the command Help without parameters.
  To toggle between the two screens (as help did before), you have to use Shift.
- If the debugger catches an ETV_CRITIC (not inside the debugger), it probably
  shows the PC correctly now. Probably? Probably, because it's not documented
  where the PC is on the stack.
- WINDOW shows now the height and width of the work area in its title bar. Also
  a bug is removed which occured if the screenbase address of the debugger had
  changed. And it considers now, which fonts is used by the debugger, to calcu-
  late the minimum size of the window.
- PBUGCONF: quite a lot changes has been made and many bugs have been removed.
  Most of the dialogs have now the button "Setzen", which works like "OK", but
  does not close the dialog. It's now possible to change SYMBOL_FLAG (dialog
  "Diverses"). It handles now the semaphore SCREEN_LOCK correctly. Errors while
  loading a font cause it now to dismiss the font. It wasn't possible any more
  NOT to double click a button, this is fixed.


24.05.93, 1.11
--------------

- "Ascii/Disassemble/List/Dump (" caused an address error.
- PEACEBUG checks now the command line when it's started and tries to lexecute
  the file.
- XBRA without any parameter gives you now a complete list of all XBRA-ID's and
  where they where found. The correct syntax of this command is now:
  Xbra [FirstVector[,LastVector[,ID]]]
       ^                             ^
  Besides, the routine has become faster.
- Find/Hunt and Compare mark now every address with * if it's inside PEACEBUG'S
  code or inside other address spaces allocated by the debugger.
- If an internal bus-/addresserror occured and the isp was zero, the debugger
  crashed. This is fixed now. Zero stores will not be corrected automatically,
  as I don't want to forbid anyone to do such things, especially as the debugger
  can recover by a reset.
- PEACEBUG is now able to switch the screen also on F030. Neverthless there are
  some restriction on these machines: the command Switch does not work and it's
  probably? not reset proof.
- PEACEBUG supports now the resident symbol driver of Robert Federle. It doesn't
  matter in which order they are started. The debugger uses it's own symbols to-
  gether with the ones of the driver. As the driver does not search the symbols
  exactly like PEACEBUG does, the output can be different (PEACEBUG shows less
  symbols). Also there are problems with the parser: e.g. you type "l .flock+1",
  which would work with the debugger's search routine, but not with the driver's
  one, because this one searches for .flock+1, a symbol that doesn't exist.
  Another problem is the command Symbol, which can print all symbols within cer-
  tain borders, which is impossible with the symbol driver (there is no such
  function). But it does naturally print the debugger's symbols.


07.04.93, 1.10
--------------

Why this increase from 1.05 to 1.10? - That's why:
1. PEACEBUG was written as a background debugger. As it supports symbols and is
   able to load executables, I decided to let it run as "normal" program if it's
   started from desktop. That means, you can start and terminate it like other
   programs.
   If it is started from the auto folder, it's still a TSR, but if it is started
   from the desktop, it pops up immediately and can be terminated with QUIT.
   If you want to install it as a TSR from the desktop, you have to press Cont-
   rol after you started it.
   Differences between the two versions:
   - Program version: no cookie and double page are installed, it can be termi-
     nated, two additional commands: Resident and Lexecute.
   - Resident version: installs a cookie and a double page, can't be terminated,
     The commands Resident and Lexecute are not available.
   The command Resident allows you to terminate and keep the debugger resident.
2. The disassembler recognizes now all FPU opcodes (MC6888x/MC68040).
   The assembler still does not recognize them apart from fnop, frestore and
   fsave.
3. Finally I decided to document the so-called cheatmode, which has been imple-
   mented for a long time already. This mode is differerent to the "normal" mode
   in the following points:
   - There is the command MOve Address: it moves the code of the debugger to an-
    other address... very dangerous.
   - Internally the debugger runs with interrupt level 7. The consequence is,
    that no interrupt can occur, even no keyboard interrupt. Nevertheless the
    keyboard works naturally, but without keydelay and keyrepeat. Also not all
    chars can be reached, because the debugger cannot find out the asciicode of
    the pressed key (normally it gets the asciicode from the OS).
   - A reset is always catched, even if it's configured not to catch it.
   - The routine VEKTOR installs always any routine if the flag isn't set to
    zero (untrap routine). The routines are also untrapped and reinstalled, if
    they are not in the first position.
   How to toggle between "normal" and cheat mode?
   By pressing Control+Alternate+Shiftleft+Shiftright+Escape!

And some smaller changes:
- There are opcodes which are actually allowed but not very useful:
  e.g. branches to odd addresses (jmp/jsr/bsr/bcc/dbcc/fbcc/fdbcc).
  PEACEBUG tells you this by writting ??? to the end of the string.
- And there are opcodes which are not allowed (Motorola says so), but work
  nevertheless:
  e.g. FABS.X FPm,FPn with effective address field unequal zero (also any other
  monadic operations of that form).
  PEACEBUG tells you this by writting ? to the end of the string.
- PBUGCONF calls FORM_BUTTON now only if the window found by WIND_FIND is the
  top one (sorry no dialogs in inactive windows.). Some small "bugs" fixed.
- Showmemory [Term[,List]]: Term can have any length from now on (40 chars was
  the maximum in previous versions).
- Ascii, Disassemble, Dump and List have a new parameter:
  Command [Von][[,Bis]|[[,]#Zeilen]|[,][Bytes]|[.]]
                                               ^^^^
  . means, that it lists from the startaddress endlessly.
- ? Term{,Term} prints now the value of Term also as a string.
  ? $50425547 outputs:
  $50425547 .1346524487 %01010000010000100101010101000111 o12020452507 "PBUG"
- Sometimes the formula interpreter didn't handle strings correctly.
- If the output of a command didn't go to the screen, it was always shortened to
  80 chars. From now on, the string is going to any device unshortened (apart
  from the screen device).
- If a string is going to the screen and is too long, then the debugger marks
  this line with an  at the end.
- Tnosubs (F12) did work only with jsr but not with bsr. This was a bug of the
  disassembler.
- Xbra has a new parameter:
  Xbra FirstVector[,LastVector[,ID]]
                              ^^^^^^
  If Xbra is called with an ID, it prints only the XBRA lists, that contain this
  ID. The routine with this ID is marked with .
  This allows you easily to test whether a program installs into some vectors or
  not.
- Every function of PEACEBUG can now be interrupted by pressing escape any time
  you want.
- PEACEBUG uses now SETEXC to install into vectors when it's started. The rou-
  tine VEKTOR still changes XBRA links if necessary.
- New function in PEACEBUG: control Q. It corresponds to the command Quit.
- New functions in PBUGCONF: control Q. It corresponds to the close buttons of a
  window. UNDO selects the "Abbruch" Button.
- It's now possible to call PEACEBUG only by pressing shift keys.


01.03.93, 1.05
--------------

- A bug, which prevented the debugger from loading the symbol table if it was
  started from the desktop, is removed.
- Loading a symbol tables has become faster.
- PEACEBUG tells you now, if it was able to load a symbol table when it's star-
  ted.
- PEACEBUG supported up to now two different formats for the symbol table (PEA-
  CEBUG.SYM). From now on, only a third format (ASCII) is supported, please look
  up the readme for PEACEBUG.
- PBUGCONF evaluates now also WM_TOP and WM_UNTOPPED. Before it could happen,
  that the cursor wasn't visible even if the window was the top one.
- PEACEBUG sometimes called MALLOC/MXALLOC with negative values. This is defini-
  tely not allowed and fixed.
- Find [begin][,end] now searches only till end-1 as it was documented. The same
  for Compare.
- The memory protection modes are shown now correctly when loading a file. Addi-
  tionally it also shows when the program has shared memory.
- The messages of PEACEBUG are in English now.
- PBUGCONF supports now the FSEL cookie --> fsel_exinput is called instead of
  fsel_input.
- In the reset routine the debugger checks now whether it is damaged or not. In
  the first case it selfterminates.
- When PEACEBUG was called by CALLBPUG, no cacheentry was set. Because of that,
  the register values could get lost and it was not possible to leave the debug-
  ger.


21.01.93, 1.04
--------------

- PBUGCONF is totally rewritten, any dialog appears now in a window and is non
  modal
- Bug in PEACEBUG removed, which occured when you tried to trace a trap with F1


14.01.93, 1.03
--------------

- Fetching internal bus- and addressexceptions has changed totally. Even if you
  unchain the two exceptionroutines of PEACEBUG, it fetches them.
- The routine "Vektor" was called when entering PEACEBUG up to now. From now on,
  it's also called if u press Return/Enter or F1-F10. This allows still a better
  working with two debuggers at the same time. If a program patches vectors in
  an interrupt, PEACEBUG works also better because of that.
- Because of this change the value -3 (see readme) of the upper byte which was
  used by the routine "Vektor", does not exist any more.
- The command Xbra now automatically takes the next correct adress, that means
  it recognizes if it has to increment the adress by 1, 2, 3 or 4. X 5,9 gives
  you the XBRA list of 5 and 8 (5, 6 and 8 before).
- Big parts of WINDOW have been rewritten. It switches now also to the window if
  the window is not topped but the workspace is not covered by another window.
  It works now fine under Multitos. The Full Button of the window works now cor-
  rectly, resizing the window is possible now.


07.01.93, 1.02
--------------

- Bugs in the editor, which appeared only on high resolutions, are fixed
- When leaving the debugger, a cache entry was not always created, e.g. with
  DoPC. This is fixed now.
- The command XBRA gives you a warning if the VBR (68010-68040/60) is not zero.
  Nevertheless it gives you the xbra list without adding VBRA.
- PEACEBUG sometimes "creates" exception of its own. Now it also adds the VBR
  when doing this.
- The keyboardhandler is now prepared for Remote Debugging. This can be tested
  with the programs in \PEACEBUG\REMOTE\.


26.10.92, 1.01
--------------

- The reset handling has changed totally. If the debugger is active, a reset is
  always catched. If it's not active, it depends on the flags whether it catches
  the reset or not (use PBUGCONF to set the flags).
- The command Reset is replaced by two new commands: Cold and Warm, which cause
  a cold- or warmboot.
- A bug in the disassembler was fixed. Opcodes without operands always produced
  an eight byte String (filled with spaces). If you searched for these opcodes
  with "ascfind", you always had to add *, otherwise the opcode was not found.
- Some people did not like the Debugger to show an alertbox when it was started
  from the desktop. From now on, it always prints its message to the console.
- An unknown command caused the debugger to print "Befehl nicht gefunden". From
  now on, only a new prompt will be printed.
- Help shows you now the significant chars of a command in big letters, the rest
  of it in small letters. Significant means, the minimum of chars you have to
  type (e.g. WRitesector --> WR are significant).
- XBRA is a good idea, but even with XBRA you can't hang out a routine from the
  resvector, because of resvalid, which is perhaps not magic (especially for the
  first program hanging in this vector).
  My solution is quite easy: the reset routine checks if there's still another
  program hanging in the vector or if it's the last one. In the first case it
  writes $31415926 to resvalid (the magic), otherwise it clears resvalid.
  This guarantees that TOS jumps to all routines hanging in this vector till the
  last one stops this procedure (by clearing resvalid).
- If you had Uwe Seimet's HDDRIVER installed and is was hanging in the resvec-
  tor, PEACEBUG crashed if it tried to terminate after a reset. This was my
  fault!
- Thanks to Diskus, which executes a move sr,-(sp) in usermode, I found a bug in
  my "privileg violation" exception handler. This is fixed now. I hope, further
  versions of Diskus will not do the move in usermode any more.
- As there is a bug in a well known hardware accelerator, I had to remove all
  tas opcodes in all programs released together with PEACEBUG.
- Nasty bug fixed. It prevented the Debugger from recognizing the CPU automati-
  cally when no _CPU Cookie was found.


10.10.92, 1.00
--------------

- PEACEBUG V1.00 is released


25.09.92, 0.17 ·
----------------

- Tritt beim Anzeigen von Speicher (List, Disassemble, Ascii, Dump) ein Bus-
  oder Adressfehler auf, wird nun keine Meldung mehr ausgegeben, sondern es
  erfolgt eine Ausgabe bestehend aus -. Ein list -1 #1 ergibt jetzt:
  $FFFFFFFF>! ???      ----                                   ; --60
  Dies erlaubt es Ihnen nun, auch Hardwareregister anzusehen.
  Eine weitere Konsequenz davon ist, dass es nun ÅberflÅssig ist, mit Showmemory
  angezeigte Zeilen zu lîschen, da kein Fehler mehr auftreten kann.
- Ein kleiner Fehler im Assembler wurde beseitigt. Ein bra.s mit Offset -1
  ($60FF = label: bra.s label+1) kann nun Åbersetzt werden. Wenn Sie Code fÅr
  zessoren >MC68010 erzeugen, wird daraus automatisch ein bra.l ($60FF $FFFF
  $FFFF).
- Dank eines Fehlers im Profibuch, hat sich auch ein Fehler im Debugger einge-
  schlichen. Dbaselow wurde irrtÅmlich als $ffff820c definiert, beim Bildschirm
  umschalten konnte so der Bildschirm verschoben sein (STE/TT).
- Das Laden einer Symboltabelle mit 0 Symbolen war fehlerhaft (SchleifenzÑhler
  wurde nicht getestet).
- LEXECUTE setzte beim zweiten Laden den Pfad nicht korrekt und fand so manchmal
  das Programm nicht.
- XBRA erkennt nun, wann es Vierer- und wann Zweierschritte machen muss.
  Ein x 82,88 gibt nun die XBRA-Liste fÅr $82,$84 und $88 aus (vorher $82 und
  $86).

- énderung in PBUGCONF. Man kann im Dialog Flags nun sowohl den Button "SR,<ea>"
  als auch den Button "CCR,<ea>" deselektieren. Dies war bis anhin nicht mî-
  glich.
- Der Befehl FREE wird implementiert, er gibt den grîssten freien Speicherblock
  aus.
- LÑngenangaben beim Befehl Info werden nun dezimal ausgegeben anstatt hexadezi-
  mal.
- Das Laden der Symboltabellen wird beschleunigt.
- Ein Fehler in der Doppelseite, der nur auf dem TT auftrat, wurde beseitigt.
- Wenn durch ein move sr,<ea> eine Exception ausgelîst wurde und der Debugger
  den Befehl im Supervisormodus ausfÅhrte, war das Supervisorbit in <ea> aus
  Versehen gesetzt.
- Die Befehle XBRA und COOKIE setzen nun ein * hinter die eigene Routine. Dies
  ist praktisch, wenn Sie PEACEBUG zweimal installiert haben.
- LEXECUTE setzt nun den Pfad auf das Verzeichnis, das das zu startende Programm
  enthÑlt.
- Der Debugger kann nun bei Programmstart nicht mehr mit Shift rechts aufgerufen
  werden.
- AHDI scheint nach einem Reset den untersten Teil des Speichers zu beschreiben.
  Dies fÅhrt dazu, dass ein Teil des Debuggers Åberschrieben wird, wenn er zu-
  unterst im Speicher liegt, was der Fall ist, wenn er reset resident gehalten
  wird.
  Damit er beim zweiten Reset nicht abstÅrzt (weil er eben von AHDI Åberschrie-
  ben wird), reserviert er 10KB vor dem Programmcode, in denen sich der HD-Trei-
  ber "austoben" kann.
  Das ganze nÅtzt nichts, wenn er von Anfang an am Speicheranfang liegt, z.B.
  wenn er als erstes Autoordnerprogramm gestartet wird.

- Wiedermal hat sich in der Bus-/Adressfehlerroutine ein Fehler eingeschlichen,
  der auftrat falls der Masterstack des unterbrochenen Programms nicht initiali-
  siert war.
- Ein Fehler in der Initialisierungsroutine wurde beseitigt. Er trat auf, wenn
  man in den Debugger einsprang, bevor er sich mit Ptermres beendet hatte und
  dann resetete.
- Der Befehl LAST wird implementiert, er zeigt die jeweils letze Einsprungsmel-
  dung an.
- Der Assembler wird voll MC680x0 tauglich gemacht, sowohl die erweiterten
  Adressierungsarten, als auch die zusÑtzlichen Befehle bis MC68040 (ohne FPU)
  werden nun unterstÅtzt.

- Der Spooler setzt die Vektoren nun mittels Setexc, ein kleiner Bug beim be-
  stimmen von ACT_PD wurde beseitigt.
- Die Befehle Readsector und Writesector werden implementiert. Einige Anpass-
  ungen bei anderen Befehlen werden dadurch nîtig: Checksumme nimmt nun als De-
  faultadresse die Sektorpufferadresse, Info wird erweitert.
- Beim Configprogramm kînnen Sie die Funktionen, die sich unter dem MenÅpunkt
  "Konfigurieren verstecken, nun auch aus dem Programm selber aufrufen. Vorher
  wurden diese nur bei Programmstart aufgerufen.
- Ein Fehler bei der Bus-/Adresserrorerkennung wurde beseitigt.
- Das interne Cursorhandling wird neu programmiert.
- Ein schlimmer Fehler in der Doppelseite wurde beseitigt (bei Malloc wurde
  ein falscher ACT_PD gesetzt).
- Der Befehl Lexecute wird implementiert. Gleichzeitig wird der Debugger voll
  symbolisch. Ein neues internes Symboltabellenformat wird definiert, alle ge-
  ladenen Symboltabellen werden in dieses Format konvertiert (GST-/DRI-Programm,
  GST-/DRI-Konstanten, Bugabookonstanten). Diese Konvertierung hat zur Folge,
  dass PEACEBUG.SYM nun immer gleichviel Speicher belegt, egal in welchem Format
  es vorliegt.
- SYMBOL_FLAG wird dokumentiert (Schnittstelle).
- PBUGCONF hat einige interne VerÑnderungen erfahren.
- Bis anhin wurde bei Auftreten eines Adress-/Busfehlers bei Showmemory die ent-
  sprechende Zeile automatisch gelîscht. Hier hat sich ein Fehler eingeschli-
  chen, dies wurde hiermit korrigiert.

- Das Wind_update Handling beim Config wird verbessert.
- Der Befehl Newscreen wird in Newformat unbenannt.
- Der Befehl Switch bekommt eine andere Bedeutung. Bis anhin musste man den Wert
  angeben, der ins Shiftmoderegister geschrieben werden sollte. Jetzt gibt man
  die Auflîsung wie bei Setscreen (XBIOS 5) an. Ausserdem wird beim Setzen der
  Debuggerauflîsung nun der Screen neu initialisiert (nicht neu reserviert).

- Ein Fehler beim Aufruf von appl_init wurde beseitigt.
- Einige Unschînheiten bei der Exceptionbehandlung eliminiert.
- WINDOW lÑuft noch nicht korrekt unter Multitos, es wird nun eine Fehlermeldung
  ausgegeben.
- Editor um die Funktionen Control T/C/R/X/S/A/H/D/L/W erweitert.
- Die Befehle Load, Save und Slow werden implementiert.
- Ein Fehler im Startupcode wird beseitigt.
- Ich beginne damit, alle Befehle an Load anzupassen ---> Adressen des geladenen
  Files als Defaultadressen etc.
- Der Befehl : wird modifiziert (keine Defaultadresse mehr).
- Die Anpassungen an Load sind fertig, die Anfangs- bzw. Endadresse des gela-
  denen Files wird nun von fast allen Befehlen als Defaultadresse(n) benutzt.
  Ausnahmen: Ascii, Disassemble, Dump, List, Call, Do und Go, welche weiterhin
  den PC als Default verwenden. Der PC wird automatisch auf den Anfang des ge-
  ladenen Files gesetzt. Rmdirectory benutzt nun den Filenamen von Load als
  Default.
- Einige Unsauberkeiten beim Verwalten des Pfades werden eliminiert. Der Pfad
  eines Files kann jetzt sauber rekonstruiert werden.
- Ein Modul (fÅr Turboassembler) zum Integrieren einer Reloziertabelle in ein
  Programm wird erstellt und PEACEBUG gleich mit diesem behandelt. D.h. der
  Debugger lÑdt seine Relozierinformationen nicht mehr nach, sondern hat diese
  schon im Datensegment integriert.
- Ein Fehler beim Aufruf von fsel_exinput wird im Config beseitigt.
