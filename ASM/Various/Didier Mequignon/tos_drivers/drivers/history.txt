2005 July 31
------------
Rodolphe Czuba start a PCI extention project for the CT60, a board 
witha bridge PLX 9054 who is compatible with the PLX 9080 used on the 
MILAN.
Because in 2005 the TOS is a sort of graphical open firmware, the TOS 
must boot with the PCI main devices (like screen, mouse and 
keyboard).
So I have planned two mains drivers inside the CT60 PCI TOS:
- The first, is a the graphic driver for all Radeon PCI boards based 
on the linux/XFree, fVDI and Picdesk sources.
- The second, is an ohci/ehci driver based on linux sources.
The PCI drivers are loaded with the CT60 Flash Tool in HEX format (S 
record) at the top of the flash, so the Atari Diagnostics are not 
valid when the PCI drivers are loaded.

2006 January 26
---------------
There are lot of work for add PCI support (PCI BIOS, drivers, etc...) 
inside the TOS, nevertheless since some months I wait the hardware 
for test the Radeon driver (the main driver).
The PCI (X)BIOS is finished since 2005 August but not tested.
CTPCI hardware registers mapping (configuration and slots interrupts) 
are needed for finish this part.
Some specific PLX XBIOS calls (like dma_setbuffer, dma_buffoper, 
read_mailbox and write_mailbox) are added to the original PCI (X)BIOS 
calls (inside the boot). The PLX is also the first device of the PCI 
(X)BIOS so it's possible to install and use hisinterrupts and not 
only PCI slots.
The Radeon driver is finished to write since 2005 October but not 
tested.
In 2005 November a solution was found for test and debug the fVDI 
part and the TOS calls,the current alpha release works with a 65K x 
640 x 480 Videl screen!
The fVDI driver is inside the TOS but can also be called by a latest 
version of fVDI installed inside the AUTO folder (radeon.sys). The 
fVDI implemention inside the TOS is reduced to the minimum code size, 
the TOS calls are rewrited but use always the original VDI variables 
and structures. So for example the true type fonts are unimplemented.
The accelerated hardware functions today are mouse, blitting (screen 
copy), lines, filling, and virtual screen. The XBIOS installed only 
by the TOS driver update screen functions (like Physbase, Vsetscreen, 
Vsetmode, Montype, Vgetsize, and Vsetrgb) and the new CT60CONF.CPX 
can set boot/default screen with 256 or 65K colors in:
- 320 x 240
- 640 x 480
- 800 x 600
- 1024 x 768
- 1280 x 960
- 1600 x 1200
The driver has also 32M colors modes but the TOS can't use these 
modes.
The driver test the host bridge endian from the PCI (X)BIOS, so the 
host can swap bytes or the radeon board can swap bytes (actually the 
PCI (X)BIOS boot configure the PLX for swap bytes so all PCI boards 
can work in Intel format, the PCI himself has a Intel format).
The USB driver is in progress, but paused because it's better to wait 
the hard and finish the first driver.

PCI on the evaluation board M5484LITE:
======================================
After 3 months without working (I need hardware), and at the 
beginning of April, Mark Duckworth send a mail about a donated 
Coldfire evaluation board for Atari developments, the M5484LITE. I 
was very interrested :-). This board has:
- A Coldfire MCF8584 at 200 MHz.
- A serial port with CTS/RTS.
- A CAN port (industrial network 1 Mbits/s maximum who can be used 
with a special Eiffel PS/2 interface).
- A PCI connector 50 MHz.
- 2 ethernet 100 Mbits ports.
- 64 MB of SDRAM DDR.
- 4 MB of flash.
- A CompactFlash socket.
There are lot of work for run a TOS on a Coldfire, but it's a method 
for me to test the PCI bios and the Radeon driver. The second reason 
is for a contribution to the Atari community on the Atari Coldfire 
Project.

2006 June 3
-----------
The TOS works until starting GEM, the PCI bios works for 
configuration, the VDI cannot be used because blitter hardware not 
exist, so we need to use the Radeon with fVDI, and an ATX power 
supply must be connected on the M5484LITE.
Now there are two targets, the ct60tos.bin and the firetos.hex.

2006 June 28
------------
After rebuild the PCI TOS with X86EMU added for init my Radeon 
Sapphire All-In-Wonder VE 64 MB PCI (Radeon 7500) board correctly 
with his VGA Bios, the (X)BIOS works on the board with a screen 
selected at 1024 x 768 x 65K colors and also in 256 colors.
The next step is to test the VDI inside the TOS.

2006 August 18
--------------
After add a 2 MB ram-disk, a TFTP loader with a file list inside a 
TFTP.INF, because I had some problems with the GEMDOS and the 
Coldfire, I have finally after some changes used BDOS (from Emutos). 
The desktop works in 1280 x 1024 x 65K colors, sure there are always 
some bugs (for example the state SELECTED inside the menus, the 
transparent graphic modes not accelerated actually, but the TOS works 
just quite enough. As weel as I have tried with success Aniplayer 
(without sound ;-) ). The screen modes in 256 colors works also. 
Actually I havn't tried fVDI and RADEON.SYS inside the AUTO folder. 
The fVDI part used here is inside the TOS and use his variables.

2006 September 10
-----------------
Rewriting texts fonctions of fVDI in Coldfire opcodes. Modification 
of TOS for working in 16M colors, the color icons are displayed in 
monochrome.

2006 December 8
---------------
Modification at the XBIOS video modecode for get different 
frequency (56, 60, 70, 85 Hz).
Acceleration of the Radeon driver and the TOS VDI (based on fVDI).

2006 December 28.
-----------------
Now I have a 2nd graphic board, a Sapphire Radeon 9250 128 MB - 64  
bits.
VDI Texts (v_gtext, v_justified), lines (v_pline, v_bar), filling 
(v_bar, v_recfl), and copy (vrt_cpyfm, vro_cpyfm) are now at the 
maximum speed :-).
The TOS himself call the accelerated functions and bypass fVDI.
The driver is always compatible with fVDI, but backward compatibility 
seems broken since fVDI 1.14 (vwk structure).
Filling works also with user color patterns (vsf_updat), and text 
rotation works (vst_rotation) like the original TOS. This features 
actually not works inside fVDI.

2007 January 24
---------------
Integration of VIDIX inside the TOS with some new XBIOS functions 
beetween 400 and 417:
- 400 - vixGetVersion
- 401 - vixProbe
- 402 - vixInit
- 403 - vixDestroy
- 404 - vixGetCapability
- 405 - vixQueryFourcc
- 406 - vixConfigPlayback
- 407 - vixPlaybackOn
- 408 - vixPlaybackOff
- 409 - vixPlaybackFrameSelect
- 410 - vixGetGrKeys
- 411 - vixSetGrKeys
- 412 - vixPlaybackGetEq
- 413 - vixPlaybackSetEq
- 414 - vixPlaybackGetDeint
- 415 - vixPlaybackSetDeint
- 416 - vixPlaybackCopyFrame
- 417 -vixQueryDMAStatus
Now, it's possible to play movies in full screen with Aniplayer :-) 
(my current screen is 1280 x 1024 x 16M), actually RGB and YUV (MPEG 
for example) output formats.
I have tried without success bus mastering with the Radeon, so I use 
the DMA (there are 16 channels on the Coldfire and 2 channels on the 
CTPCI PLX 9054 bridge).
Now I try to get TV on the Sapphire All-In-Wonder VE 64 MB PCI 
(Radeon 7500).
DirectFB seems a better choice for get 3D hardware acceleration 
(supported by Mesa).

2007 February
-------------
Suspended working on the Radeon board. We are in 2007, so why try to 
get analog TV on the Sapphire All-In-Wonder VE?
New plans for integration of a real time OS and a TCP/IP stack for 
add new Coldfire tools.
The choice is FreeRTOS and lwIP.

2007 March
----------
Add an HTTP server, html pages are in flash memory.
Moved the PCI part of the TOS in flash compressed to LZ format. After 
decompress the TOS, now there are two parts:
- 0xE00000-0xEFFFFF
- 0xFC0000-0xFEFFFF
The compressed part is stored always from 0xE00000 to 0xEEFFFF (CT60 
TOS compatibility with the parameters inside flash at 0xEF0000 to 
0xEFFFFF).

2007 April
----------
Add a TFTP and a FTP server using the internal 8 MB ram-disk.
Add a command line shell using the serial port (terminal) or a Telnet 
server.

2007 October
------------
With GlueStick (socket BSD using lwIP), add the STiK functions and 
his cookie.
It's also possible to get, by a direct call, the functions of the 
TCP/IP stack with a 'SOCK' cookie:
- socket
- bind
- listen
- accept
- connect
- write
- send
- sendto
- read
- recv
- recvfrom
- shutdown
- close
- getsockname
- getpeername
- getsockopt
- setsockopt
- select
- ioctl
- gethostbyname
- geterrno
Tested with AFTP (STiK) and a rebuild version of Highwire (BSD socket 
using lwIP and the 'SOCK' cookie).

2008 Jannuary
-------------
Add the M54455EVB target, the makefile can create three targets: 
- CT60 CTPCI (MC68060)
- M5484LITE (Coldfire v4e MCF548x)
- M54455EVB (Coldfire v4m MCF54455)
The evaluation board M54455EVB is a complete Atari:
- Freescale MCF54455 Coldfire microprocessor
- DDR2 SDRAM (256 Mbyte)
- Two NOR flash memory devices (16 Mbyte, 512 KByte)
- Serial flash
- U-Boot bootloader
- MRAM (512 KByte, accessible through FPGA Flexbus interface) 
- Four PCI slots
- Two port Ethernet
- ATA connector
- Audio interface (I2S mode of SSI module connected to audio codec) 
- Multiple USB interface options: FS/LS Host via on-chip transceiver 
with host support (type A receptacle), HS/FS/LS dual-role via 
external ULPI PHY (Mini-AB receptacle)
- Two RS232 serial ports (RS232 transceivers on UART0 and UART1) 
Unfortunately the v4m has no FPU, and the board is a little bit 
expensive.
Rebuild the TOS for use:
- Timers
- Serial port
- Another serial port for the IKBD (mouse and ATARI keyboard) 
- Ethernet port 10/100
- PCI
- ATA
- DMA
- MMU
This target will be untested actually because I have no board and I 
cannot get enough peoples interrested for this new adventure.

2008 May
--------
Fix some bugs inside the TCP/IP stack.

2008 June
---------
Add a new command for trace instructions handled by the CF68KLIB for 
easily found why some programs not like it.

2008 July
---------
Moved all FreeRTOS tasks in native Coldfire code excepted the TOS who 
runs under the CF68KLIB
Add breakpoints commands for the TOS task of FreeRTOS.
When there are lot of consecutive crashs of the TOS, the task is 
killed for try to get an easy debug with with the command line shell 
of FreeRTOS.
Add a command for trace traps TOS calls.

2008 September
--------------
Fix an Ethernet bug inside the FEC driver of the MCF548X.
Add a grafical display of the FreeRTOS tasks inside the HTTP server.
If the URL isn't found inside the flash memory pages, the HTTP server 
search the file in c:\html\.
Add USB Mass Storage on the MCF548X USB device, this feature uses the 
8 MB ram-disk. The Coldfire v4e USB is a little bit bugged, but I 
have tried with success on iMac, Mac-Mini and also a Visiosat TVT 250 
USB.
The best news, Rodolphe works again on the CTPCI!

2008 October
------------
Boot possible on the ram-disk from a disk updated with USB Mass 
Storage device, this is the procedure:
- Put 'USB' inside the beginning of tftp.inf.
- When the boot create the ram-disk, a message arrives for connect 
the USB cable.
- The host computer detect the Coldfire and mount the 8 MB ram-disk. 
- Copy all his files inside the ram-disk.
- Unmount or eject the ram-disk.
- Disconnect the cable, the TOS booting process continue.

2009 May
--------
Since the beginning of this year, Mathias Wittau try that I join the 
new ACP project. I have not really an interest in this technical 
choices (base FPGA too expensive for emulate the old Atari hardware, 
preference for the Videl, only one ethernet port when the Coldfire 
used has two ports, no CAN...), and I must finish my work on the 
CTPCI, finaly I have presented my help. After all, it is possible 
that this is the single Atari Coldfire (so his project name is 
COLDARI). My fisrt objective is to add the AC97 sound to the Coldfire.
Add the COLDARI target, now the makefile can create four targets: 
- CT60 CTPCI (MC68060 100 MHz)
- M5484LITE (Coldfire v4e MCF548x 200 MHz)
- M54455EVB (Coldfire v4m MCF54455 266 MHz no FPU)
- COLDARI (Coldfire v4e MCF547x 200 MHz)
Modifications inside the TOS for manage the COLDARI target (base 
M5484LITE):
- The clocks
- The flash
- SDRAM
- A serial port for the IKBD (mouse and ATARI keyboard
- The Ethernet tranceiver 10/100
- The ATA / SCSI ports from the FPGA
Add CTPCI registers features (IDE and interrupts).

2009 June. Beginning of the CTPCI debug!
========================================
The prototype is finished, the tests can start.
The big endian and the little endian are inverted inside the 
PLX9054.
Fix device selection of the PLX9054 (for each slot), we must add 11, 
strange... this bridge is not really compatible with the PCI 
specifications.

Fredi Aschwanden send to me a CS4299 chip as audio codec for the AC97!
Writing AC97 driver based on the Linux sources for the codecs,      
however I must write totally the Coldfire part. The PSC of the 
Coldfire has an AC97 mode bit seems used by nothing on the net!
Only the the XBIOS part of the AC97 driver is easy to write, because 
I have already writed an audio driver for MagiC MAC and Aranym. 
The DMA of the Coldfire will be used for transfer the AC97 frames but 
in a first time it's only the CPU and interrupts used for send and 
receive frames by the PSC fifo (who has 512 bytes on the Coldfire). 
An AC97 frame contains 256 bits (13 slots) either 13 words inside the 
fifo (52 bytes).

2009 July
---------
Fix the device selection inside X86EMU, only the slot 3 could work! 
This was not a problem on the M5484LITE with his unique slot. With 
this modification X86EMU is faster, just two seconds for initialize 
the Radeon with his BIOS.
On the M5484LITE, installation of the audio codec AC97 CS4299.

2009 August
-----------
Separation of the PCI zone MEM in two zones prefetch or not.
Fix and add more features on the DMA PLX9054 transfers with chained 
DMA blocks if the block isn't contiguous.
On the M5484LITE, the Comm Bus is used for the transfers DMA <=> PCI, 
more than 100 MB/S with writing.
Beginning of AC97 audio driver tests, the reading of registers works 
but writing is not reliable. If the audio playback is started, 
nothing works, I see (with a command 'acpr' added to the debug) that 
some registers are put to the default value (like the sample 
frequency)!

2009 September
--------------
The PLX9054 has some limitations on his local PCI zones MEM and I/O 
who must be aligned with size and the same size, now the CT60 TOS has 
3 targets:
- CT60TOS.BIN: TOS 4.04 patchs CT60 + PCI BIOS (2 x PCI zones MEM and 
IO of 512 KB)
- CTPCITOS.BIN: TOS 4.04 patchs CT60 + PCI BIOS (2 x PCI zones MEM 
and IO of 512 KB) + PCI drivers
- CTPCI1GB.BIN: TOS 4.04 patchs CT60 + PCI BIOS (2 x PCI zones and IO 
of 1 GB) + PCI drivers
With the last case, it's impossible to add an Ethernat board (no 
empty space in the CT60 mapping), but it's possible to install a 
Radeon with 256 MB and others PCI boards.
Dialog box for change the screen inside the desktop using Vsetscenn 
mode list.
Add, with an extended bit inside the modecode, of all supported 
screens resolutions by the driver to the default modes XBIOS, now 
it's possible to get infinites combinations:
- XBIOS
- VESA
- DRIVER
- MON.1 (the driver allow to read screen modes)
Add texture functions using the Radeon from Xfree sources.
Try DVI monitors and the monitor detection from the I2C port in the 
radeon Driver.
Add support of the RTC RV5C387 on the M5485EVB by the I2C port of the 
Coldfire with a FreeRTOS task 'RTCd'.

2009 October
------------
Now Mark Duckworth has an M5485EVB board, reorganization of the 
Radeon driver for multi-target graphic board, the M5485EVB has a 
FireEngine module more complete than the M5484LITE: the LynxEM+. 
Third parts now exists:
- Radeon
- Lynx
- Video (common part)
If the Radeon board isn't found, the LynxEM is used.
To be continued... I have no board for test Lynx driver.

2009 November
-------------
New integration of a PCI USB ohci/ehci driver, now the base of 
sources is u-BOOT.
I made the test on the M5484LITE with the USB NEC board using an 
D720101 who wait the CTPCI since 4 years. The PCI bus on the 
M5484LITE is at 50 MHz and the NEC specifications is for 33 MHz, but 
USB works !
The driver according to devices detected can add USB features to TOS 
like:
- The keyboard (with tables for convert the scan-codes like Eiffel). 
- The mouse
- The USB sticks (USB mass storage), FAT16 partitions (DOS or TOS). 
The mouse and keyboard use interrupts events.
For the USB stick(s), the modified BDOS allows to use DOS partitions 
(2 GB), the TOS can use only DOS partition with the limit of 16 MB.
The XHDI protocol must allow with the help of your favrite HD driver 
to format partitions in combinated mode (DOS/TOS).
But actually if the detection and initialization of multiples devices 
works, it is impossible to use more than one in the same time !
On Coldfire and on the Coldari target, if no graphic board are 
detected a Videl driver (256/65K/16M without planes) using the same 
fVDI resources that the graphics boards is started. With the extended 
modes of the projet ACP, this feature must allow to get the same 
screen sizes than the Radeon (or the Lynx).
Changes from the Coldari target with the latest specifications from 
Fredi Aschwanden (Mapping, RTC, Blitter, etc...).

2010 March - I received the CTPCI !
===================================

2010 April
----------
Because the PLX9054 bridge is more slower than the Coldfire V4e, add 
a cold reset detection for start only in this case the VGA BIOS X86.
Activation of monitors detection on the Radeon.
Fix the change screen dialog box under the TOS desktop.
Recuced Malloc usage.
Add local stacks for the VBL, VDI, Mouse, and Bconout 2/5 routines.
Fix yellow icons bug (vq_color, thanks to Olivier Landemarre).
Fix randon freeze with Radeon fifo on some functions of the VDI 
(v_gtext and vrt_cpyfm).
Try DMA (PLX9054), writing to the PCI zone works and Kronos displays 
1500 MB/S, but reading freeze the machine. Reading disabled inside 
the driver (hardware bug).

2010 May
--------
Removed the USB board and the network board who has finished by 
create parity errors and hide the Radeon, and after hide the CTPCI 
himself during PCI scan !
Try and fix RADEON.SYS driver for fVDI (fvdi_040.prg 07 Dec 2006), 
charmap added since 2005 (old driver not compatible).Add prefered 
monitor screen to the XBIOS boot list.

2010 June - 1.0 beta 1
----------------------
Now It's possible to load separate files for the TOS404, the boot and 
the PCI drivers:
- CT60TOS.BIN: contains BOOT + TOS404 + Atari Diagnostics (must  
disappear).
- BOOT.HEX: contains the BOOT.
- DRIVERS.HEX: contains the PCI drivers (GPL licence).
Automatic detection of monitors connected to the Radeon, the 
selection is possible with the CT60 configuration CPX and monitor 
layout (MON.1,MON.2):
- DEFAULT (automatic default choice of the TOS)
- CRT,NONE
- CRT,CRT
- CRT,TMDS
- TMDS,CRT
- TMDS,TMDS
Fix for italic text width inside the Radeon driver.

2010 July
---------
Direct access to the Radeon register, it's faster.
Add monochrome emulation until 1024 x 768, the conversion in 256 
colors use the Radeon during the VBL routine if the screen must be 
updated. With the actual PLX performances (no burst), the mode 640 x 
400 in contiguous access (each VBL) use near than 50% of the CPU time:
- 640 x 480 : 6 mS
- 800 x 600 : 10 mS
- 1024 x 768 : 16 mS

2010 August
-----------
Now TOS inside Vsetscreen check if the Radeon driver apply the real 
screen selected by the modecode, else update the modecode. You can 
see this feature with the 'Test' button inside VIDEOCNF.CPX. 

2010 September - 1.0 beta 2
---------------------------
Add XBIOS patch for NVDI, now TOS overwrite NVDI XBIOS by setting the 
XBRA '_PCI' to the top list when NVDI is found. The Result: NVDI 5.01 
works and you can change screen and get list of screens with 
Vsetscreen!
Fix TOS for get NVDI working with MagiC and the new CHGRES.PRG. 
Add flash parameter and an option inside CT60CONF.CPX for add a debug 
output inside video.log.
Fixed VDI bugs with function v_fillarea (line), v_rfbox (user 
pattern), and v_locator (thanks to Claude Labelle).
Fixed the VDI function v_contourfill used by lot of graphics 
applications (Note: This function is not implemented inside fVDI).

2010 October - 1.0
------------------
Fix zero divide inside clip line routine.
Fix vrt_cpyfm in 65K colors.
Test for get working MagiC 6.20 / NVDI 5.

2010 October - I received the Firebee !
=======================================

2010 October
------------
Firebee target:
- Replaced hardware Radeon routines by CPU routines in 256/65K/16M, 
but default fill fVDI routine is very slow (fvdi directory).
- Videl driver with ACP modes (PLL clock) and I2C monitor detection 
(videl.c).

2010 November
-------------
Firebee target:
- Rewrited the default filling routine of fVDI with native Coldfire 
code, now it's faster (blit.S).

2010 December
-------------
Firebee target:
- Added SD-card driver (detxbios.S).
- Added 3 flash parameters for cnmfigure ethernet when TOS started by 
BAS and not dBUG (get.c):
 * 3 last bytes of MAC address, begin is 00:CF:54.
 * Board IP address.
 * Host IP address.
 * Netmask is automatic.
 * Gateway is 0.0.0.0.
 * Default path/filename for TFTP is /home/firebee.hex.
Coldfire targets (Firebee and M5484LITE):
- Increased BDOS limits (bdos directory).


2011 January-February
---------------------
Coldfire targets (Firebee and M5484LITE):
- Removed Linux AC97 sources for reduce size. Rewrited AC97 Coldfire 
driver (mcf548x_ac97.c). The AC97 codec works only from reset and need  
dBUG !
 * All GSXB controls are supported, but gains added to FALCON XBIOS 
   with MilanBlaster are attenuations with GSXB (it's possible to add 
   a choice in the CPX in the future if someone want MilanBlaster 
   compatibility, the driver himself support the two modes).   
 * FSOUND.CPX controls only PCM levels and record levels, but the GSXB 
   Mixer runs also in ACC. 
 * Because there are no FM input on AC97, left FM level controls the 
   PC BEEP level, and the right FM level controls 3D AC97 features 
   (for info on the Firebee the FPGA YAMAHA emulation is routed to PC 
   BEEP and AUX1 inputs).   
 * Like GSXB, the driver has some limits with FALCON compatibility 
   because the are no DSP and no Matrix. By default LINE inputs are 
   selected as record source and replace MIC FALCON input source 
   because MIC input is mono on AC97, and excepted VIDEO and FM, all 
   inputs are enabled.
 * The driver works in 8/16 bits mono/stereo for play and record samples.
 * It's impossible to use the VRA mode (Variable Rate) because this 
   feature need hardware support, the CS4299 codec works always at 48KHz 
   and the driver use a fast linear interpolation routine for lower 
   frequency (play/record).   
 * For reduce CPU load (Chronos see a 154 MHz CPU and the Firebee is 
   clocked at 164 MHz), after a 30 seconds delay timeout of inactivity 
   the AC-LINK (the name of the AC97 hardware interface) goes to 
   powerdown. For resume the Coldfire send a warn reset.   
 * For info, with Coldfire DMA transfers, 2 x 52 bytes (2 x 13 slots) 
   are send/received to/from TX/RX PSC2 FIFO by sample (5 MBytes/S), 
   when there are no samples some slots are use for read/write AC97 
   registers (XBIOS controls).   
 * STE DMA sound emulation added for the Firebee, this feature need an 
   FPGA update (blank registers used like RAM, updated with 200 Hz 
   system timer).

2011 March
----------
Added rejection modes for clocks over 135 MHz who have heat isues with
DVI on RV100 (Radeon 7000 boards).
Added accel sub functions CMD_FILLMEM, CMD_COPYMEM, CMD_TEXTUREMEM  
and CMD_GETVERSION to the XBIOS Vsetscreen (Radeon) and put some 
changes to other sub functions (xbios.c).
Firebee target:
- Added switch 6 test when the board start with dBUG (already used  with BAS):
  ON - Normal 
  OFF: Ethernet deamons (Telnet,TFTP,FTP,HTTP) and TFTP client + Ram-disk available.
- SD-Card replace A if a disk is found, and boot is faster because 
timeout on floppy without floppy is very slow (13 seconds added).
- Moved also Ram-disk to drive B.

2011 April
----------
Added accel sub functions CMD_LINEMEM, CMD_CLIPMEM, and CMD_SYNCMEM  
to the XBIOS Vsetscreen (Radeon xbios.c).
Coldfire targets:
- Added plug and play support for USB using a FreeRTOS task. But 
there are a problem when I connect the mouse or the keyboard the 2nd 
time I get "Device Not Responding" before start again the 
mouse/keyboard driver. First connection when boot start or later 
works. For me there are a bug somewhere in the low level OHCI driver. 
Plug and play works with USB stick but there are no report frame. When 
this error arrives and mouse removed and PIPE_INTERRUPT used => unlink ed.
This fix seems not works with my keyboard. The USB stack use U-Boot 
sources, it's easier to use than Linux but there are some limitations. 
Fixed also lot of bugs inside XHDI driver (SD-CARD/USB).

2011 May
---------
Firebee target:
- Rebuild with GCC 4 for the Coldfire V4e (else LwIP is 
bugged if build with GCC 3.3 -m5200 who has some troubles with short  
integers). Fixed bugs added with inline assembly parts.
- Added Emutos support with a boot OS menu:
 * Uninstall interrupt vectors handled by the CF68KLIB.
 * Delete TOS task.
 * Set screen in 640x480x16.
 * Disable caches.
 * Unprotect TOS area (0xE00000) via an ACR.
 * Copy Emutos from E0600000 (value used here).
 * Invalidate one megabyte before the lwIP area (for Emutos memory test).
 * Enable caches.
 * Start VBL task and reinstall PCI BIOS (for USB mouse/keyboard).
 * Start ETOS task.
- Extended the screen view feature inside the HTTP server. The GIF 
picture is always in 640x480x256 but with a screen in 16/65K/16M 
colors. Mouse and keyboard works from the host computer (a VNC light).

2011 June
----------
Fixed an ugly bug (crashes possible like word result on stack if the VDI 
parameter block is on the stack) with VDI function vst_rotation on all 
targets (detvdi.S).  
Added accel sub function CMD_BLANK to the XBIOS Vsetscreen (Radeon), 
works also on Firebee with FPGA Videl ACP modes (xbios.c, videl.c).
Added another boot menu and rescue features on the Fireebee target:
- SW6 and SW5 are inside the cookie '_SWI' (from boot part):
 * B7: (1) SW6 DOWN, (0) SW6 UP.
 * B6: (1) SW5 DOWN, (0) SW5 UP.
 * B0: (1) TOS started from 0xE0000000 (replace BAS or dBUG).
- SW6 up is the normal usage, the OS Boot menu has a 3rd line for 
  select a TOS with all features (like SW6 down, but this feature is 
  impossible when TOS started with BAS).
- SW6 down allows to TOS to start FTP (build option), HTTP, TFTP servers 
  and create a Ram-Disk actually in B (this feature is also possible 
  with dBUG at 0xE0000000).  
- SW5 up is the normal usage for start the TOS at 0xE0400000 (same usage 
  inside BAS or dBUG at 0xE0000000) and a boot menu has 2 choices TOS or 
  EMUTOS (TOS by default).  
- SW5 down is the rescue mode, TOS at 0xE0000000 continue to run and a 
  boot menu displays 3 choices: 
 * TOS404 (at 0xE0000000 - boot) => TOS rescue (default choice).
 * EMUTOS (at 0xE0600000).
 * TOS404 (at 0xE0400000 - normal) => TOS to test.

2011 July - 1.01
----------------
Coldfire targets:
- Rewrited in native code vr_trn_fm (blit.S).
- Added CF instructions to the 68K disassembler. Now pulse, tfp, wddata, 
wdebug, intouch, halt, mvs, mvz, mov3q, movec, sat and all mac group 
are supported.   
- Found a big bug with the sys variable membot not updated before BDOS 
started, so the previous malloc from TOS (PCI BIOS structure) was 
dead, and bug and play crashed under MiNT.  
- Fixed VDI function v_show_c without graphic card (detvdi.S).
- Increased BDOS buffers limits (fsbuf.c).
- Added Pexec patch for Pure C programs bdos\rwa.S):
  * Some case for Line A 0xA000 replaced by opcode 0xA920.
  * move.b DX,-(SP) replaced by opcode 0xA910-0xA917.
  * move.b (SP)+,DX replaced by opcode 0xA918-0xA91F.
  * move.b (AX),-(SP) replaced by opcode 0xA930-0xA937.
  * move.b (SP)+,(AX) replaced by opcode 0xA938-0xA93F.
  * move.b d(AX),-(SP) replaced by opcode 0xA9B0-0xA9B7.
  * move.b (SP)+,d(AX) replaced by opcode 0xA9B8-0xA9BF.
  * move.b abs.l,-(SP) replaced by opcode 0xA9F1.
  * move.b d(PC),-(SP) replaced by opcode 0xA9F2.
  * move.b (SP)+,abs.l replaced by opcode 0xA9F9.
  * mulu/s.l ea,dh:dl replaced by opcode 0xABC0-0xABFF.
  * divu/s.l ea:dr:dq replaced by opcode 0xAFC0-0xAFFF.
