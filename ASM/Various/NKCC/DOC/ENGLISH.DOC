   1. What is NKCC?
   =============================================================================
   Did you ever try to program a complex keyboard handling? Then you sure know
   some of the problems coming out of TOS along with the key codes ...

   a) pressing Alternate + any letter will only return the scan code, which is
      TOS version-dependend (language)

   b) some keys get different scan codes when being pressed together with
      Alternate! For example, hitting the '1' key will return a scan code
      of 2 (on the German TOS) and an ASCII code of $31 (that's ok). The key
      combination Alternate + '1' results in a scan code of $78 and an ASCII
      code of 0!

   c) the cursor keypad (arrows, Insert, ClrHome, Help and Undo) is a whole
      chaos! Some of the keys change their scan code when being pressed
      together with Control. The returned ASCII code is total rubbish and
      follows no rule.

   d) some different key combinations return the same key codes. In most cases,
      Alternate+any key and Alternate+Shift+any key cannot be distinguished.

   The solution: the Normalized Key Code Converter

   NKCC solves all of this problems. It converts key codes received from GEMDOS
   or GEM (multi event) to an own, sophisticated format, which allows to detect
   all possible key combinations. In addition, NKCC offers some special
   features:

   a) Deadkey handling

      People in countries which know characters with accents often have the
      problem that they can't reach every character directly from the keyboard.
      Or imagine a guy who wants to type a French text on a UK TOS - without
      having characters like Ä or â! This can be done if NKCC was built in his
      favourite word processor. It transforms combinations of key strokes to
      one character. The first one is called the deadkey: when you type it,
      nothing happens - yet. After the second key stroke, NKCC decides what to
      do. If matching with the first one, it merges both to one key code (for
      example: ~  plus  A  will result in  ∑). If not matching, the program
      will get both keys (e.g. ~  plus  X  will directly be passed through the
      deadkey manager). Deadkeys known by NKCC are

      ^   +   aeiou      =  Éàåìñ
      ~   +   nNaoAo     =  §•∞±∑∏
      '   +   eEaiou     =  Çê†°¢£
      `   +   aeiouA     =  Öäçïó∂
      π   +   aeiouyAOU  =  ÑâãîÅòéôö
      "   +   aeiouyAOU  =  ÑâãîÅòéôö
      ¯   +   aA         =  Üè
      ,   +   cC         =  áÄ
      /   +   oO24       =  ≥≤´¨

      The quote character as synonym for umlaut is e.g. needed on the Dutch
      keyboard, where neither umlaut characters nor the umlaut itself are
      available.

   b) Direct input of ASCII codes

      NKCC allows the ASCII code of characters to be input directly. Just press
      the Alternate key and hold it. Then type in the ASCII code on the numeric
      keyboard (as decimal number). The input is finished when either the
      Alternate key is relased or three digits are typed in. Values beyond 255
      are truncated to 8 bit (e.g. 260 ($104) becomes 4).

   c) Control key emulation

      Usually, NKCC returns key combinations like "Control A" as ASCII code $41
      (for "A") and with a set Control key flag. If the control key emulation
      is enabled, "Control A" will return an ASCII code of $01. The Control key
      flag will be cleared in this case.

      The Control key emulation converts ...

      Control + @       to    $00
      Control + A...Z   to    $01...$1A
      Control + [       to    $1B
      Control + \       to    $1C
      Control + ]       to    $1D
      Control + ^       to    $1E
      Control + _       to    $1F

      Important note:

      On several keyboards, some of the key combinations in the list above
      cannot be recognized and thus not converted. For example, on the German
      keyboard, the characters "@", "[", "\" and "]" can't be typed in together
      with the Control key. Their ASCII codes don't appear in any of the TOS
      key code tables, because they can only be reached when holding the
      Alternate key. Unfortunately, TOS returns the wrong ASCII code when
      Control is also held down, making it impossible to find out the original
      ASCII value.


   Every deadkey and special feature can be enabled/disabled separately.

   The best way to see how NKCC works is to start the demonstration program
   (DEMO.TOS) and hack on the keyboard.

   3. The normalized key code format
   =============================================================================
   NKCC returns key codes as 16 bit integer. The low byte contains the ASCII
   part of the key, the high byte is the location for some flags. Here's the
   complete format:

   Bit #       Symbolic name        Contents
   ------------------------------------------------------------
    0... 7                          ASCII code/key code
    8          NKF_RSH              right Shift key flag
    9          NKF_LSH              left Shift key flag
   10          NKF_CTRL             Control key flag
   11          NKF_ALT              Alternate key flag
   12          NKF_CAPS             current state of CapsLock key
   13          NKF_NUM              numeric keypad flag
   14          NKF_RESVD            reserved(!) for internal purposes
   15          NKF_FUNC             function flag

   Bits 8...11 speak for themself. Bit 12 reflects the current state of the
   CapsLock key. Bit 13, if set, indicates that the key is located on the
   numeric keypad. Bit 14 is reserved for internal use and must be ignored.
   However, it has a special meaning as parameter for the function nkc_cmp(),
   described in the next chapter. Finally, the MSB of the key code (bit 15)
   specifies the key type: if set, the key code stands for any function to
   perform. If not set, it contains any printable character. The bit is set
   when

   a) any of the following "function keys" is pressed:

      Esc, Tab, Backspace, Delete, Return,
      Help, Undo, Insert, ClrHome, cursor up, cursor down, cursor left,
      cursor right,
      Enter,
      F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10
      Page up, Page down, End, F11, F12, F14  (Macintosh keyboard only!)

      The ASCII code for such keys is less than 32 and defined as NK_... in
      the header files (e.g. NK_ESC for Escape).

   b) any key is pressed together with Alternate and/or Control

      In this case, NKCC always returns the CapsLock variant of a key (e.g.
      the ASCII part of the key combination Control + A is 'A' rather than
      'a').


   The function flag was intentionally placed in bit 15 to ease its handling:

   if (keycode < 0)
      perform function
   else
      use printable character

   The ASCII code of a printable character spans over the whole number range
   of an unsigned byte: from 0 up to 255.


   Please note that some key combinations cannot be caught by NKCC:

   a) keys which are hold back by TOS: any key of the cursor pad plus Alternate
      (except Alternate + Undo); they are used for mouse controlling and to
      start a screen hardcopy.

   b) characters which can only be typed in when pressing Alternate, such as
      @\[{]} on the German keyboard. They are treated correctly by NKCC, but
      they never appear with a set Alternate flag.


   Characters created by the deadkey handler or the direct ASCII input are
   returned as if present on the keyboard. None of the flags, except CapsLock,
   can be set. Key codes created by the Control key emulation never appear with
   a set Control key flag.


   Invalid scan codes

   Older versions of NKCC produced simply garbage when they received a key
   code with an invalid scan code. Since release 2.92 such key codes are
   treated a defined way. They are converted to a special case of the
   normalized format which cannot be achieved by using the regular keyboard.
   The format is:

   function flag  = 1
   alternate flag = 0
   control flag   = 0
   ASCII code     >= $20

   Or in other words: a printable character with set function flag, but
   without Alternate and Control flags being set (this cannot occur due
   to the definition of the normalized key format).

   What for, you ask? Well, the major reason for this mechanism was a
   graphics tablet driver I wrote in Spring '94. The graphics tablet has
   some macro buttons, and I wanted the driver to create key codes for
   every macro button that was hit (which makes it very easy for
   applications to receive "macro button events").

   The format of a "macro key" is:

   scan code  = $84...$ff ($ff is recommended)
   ASCII code = $20...$ff (codes less than $20 are set to $20 by NKCC)

   The flags for CapsLock, LeftShift and RightShift are directly written
   to the normalized key code. The Alternate and Control flags are evaluated,
   too: if at least one of them is non-zero then the numeric keypad flag in
   the converted key code will be set.

   Back-converting a macro key with the function nkc_n2tos() respectively
   nkc_n2gem() always results in a scan code of $ff. Both Alternate and
   Control will be set if the numeric keypad flag was set in the normalized
   key code.




   4. NKCC usage
   =============================================================================
   Working with NKCC is rather simple. Only a few functions have to be called.

   Before receiving the first key code, NKCC has to be initialized by an
   nkc_init() call. nkc_init() gets three parameters: The first is a 32 bit
   integer with some flags, defined as NKI_... in the header file NKCC.H
   (respectively NKIb_.../NKIf_... in NKCC.I). The following flags exist:

   NKI_BUTHND        are both used to control the built-in handler for mouse
   NKI_BHTOS         button events, described in the chapter "The button event
                     handler"

   NKI_NO200HZ       if set, NKCC won't install the timer interrupt used for
                     the function nkc_timer(). Note: if the button event
                     handler is being activated, this flag is ignored because
                     the timer is needed then for NKCC-internal purposes.

   nkc_init()'s second parameter is the handle of a virtual VDI workstation,
   also needed for the button event handler. It may be zero if the handler is
   not installed.

   At last the third parameter is a pointer to the applications GLOBAL array
   (one of the AES parameter arrays). The pointer isn't used by NKCC_TOS.O.
   When using NKCC in applications developed with Turbo C respectively Pure C
   this parameter is  _GemParBlk.global  (defined in AES.H).

   The function returns a 16 bit integer with NKCC's version number as
   4 digit BCD (main # in high byte, sub # in low byte).

   The most simple call of nkc_init() would be:

   nkc_init(0,0,NULL);


   Accordingly, NKCC has to be turned off before your program is quit. This is
   done by an nkc_exit() call. The function has no input parameters, but
   returns a status code: if NKCC has linked itself into the system vectors,
   and somebody has corrupted the XBRA vector list, it will be unable to
   deinstall and returns an according error code. This is fatal! Your program
   must not terminate in this case! Show a warning message and tell the user
   to reboot.


   NKCC offers several methods to receive key codes. Their main difference is
   the kind of program NKCC is linked to: TOS or GEM application/accessory.
   Consult the according chapters for details.


   The special handlers for direct ASCII input, deadkey handling etc. are
   controled via the function nkc_set(). The function gets a long integer with
   32 flags as parameter. A set flag enables the feature, a cleared flag
   disables it. Their symbolic names are:

   NKS_ALTNUM        for direct ASCII input
   NKS_CTRL          for control key emulation
   NKS_D_...         for deadkey management


   When comparing two normalized key codes, no direct check should be made
   (like: if (key1 == key2) ...)! Use the function nkc_cmp() instead. It uses
   some specific rules which improve the flexibility of key code comparism.
   The function gets two key key codes as parameters, one called "reference
   key code" and the other "test key code". Some bits of the reference key code
   (the first parameter) are treated a special way:

   NKF_IGNUM (same as NKF_RESVD)
      if set, the numeric keypad flag doesn't matter

   NKF_CAPS (CapsLock state)
      if set, the case of the ASCII code doesn't matter

   NKF_SHIFT (both Shift keys; identical to NKF_LSH | NKF_RSH)
      if BOTH shift flags are set in the reference key code, the combination of
      shift key flags in the test key code doesn't matter: only one shift flag
      has to be set, no matter which one.




   5. NKCC in TOS applications
   =============================================================================
   When being used in a TOS type program (without windows, AES dialogs and
   mouse), the TOS-version of NKCC should be used (file NKCC_TOS.O). Some
   functions for multi event and mouse handling are missing in that file,
   making it some KBytes smaller.

   The functions, which have to be called, are:

   nkc_conin()
      works similar to the GEMDOS functions Cconin()/Crawcin() or the BIOS
      function Bconin(2). It waits until a key is pressed and returns its code
      in normalized format, as 16 bit integer. The function bases on GEMDOS'
      Crawcin(). If you like to use Cconin() or Bconin(), just change the
      system call in the NKCC source.

   nkc_cstat()
      replaces Cconis() respectively Bconstat(). It checks, if there is any key
      code in the OS internal key buffer and returns an according status:
      0=no key, -1=at least one key in buffer




   6. NKCC in GEM applications
   =============================================================================
   In GEM applications or accessories, NKCC replaces the whole multi event
   handler with its function nkc_multi(), which gets the same parameters as
   usual C multi event bindings. The differences are:

   a) key codes are returned in normalized format

   b) the key state is returned NKCC compatible, which means: key state flags
      are placed in bits 8...11 rather than bits 0...3 and can be testet using
      the NKF_... symbols


   There's no NKCC function which replaces evnt_keybd(). Please use nkc_multi()
   instead - or write your own binding!



   Special extension for assembler programmers - by Gerd Knops
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   When using the event_multi-routine, you probably have code like
   this in your source-code:

   ... setting up the aes-arrays, then
          bsr     aes

   with

   aes:   move.l  #aespb,d1
          move    #$c8,d0
          trap    #2
          rts

   Simply replace 'bsr  aes' with 'bsr nkc_amulti'. Note, that you
   have to use the AES-arrays from NKCC for this purpose.
   See chapter 9 for a symbol overview.



   7. The button event handler
   =============================================================================
   Some years ago Atari released the long awaited TOS version 1.04. It had some
   very nice new features and improvements. TOS 1.04 (or a higher version) is a
   must for every ST user. Unfortunately, the guys in Sunnyvale messed up the
   multi event handler in the AES, making it impossible to receive mouse button
   events and timer events with short cycle times in one evnt_multi() call,
   without having big problems with the double click: the multi event returns
   immediately when a timer event occurs. If it was just processing a mouse
   click (waiting for a possible second click), the resulting event mask is
   MU_TIMER *and* MU_BUTTON! No chance to get through a double click.

   I spent hours to find a way how I could bypass this problem. Finally, I
   decided to write an own mouse button event handler, and put it into NKCC.

   The NKCC button event handler is activated at initialization time. Two flags
   in the longword passed to nkc_init() control whether the handler should be
   installed or not:

   NKI_BUTHND              install it

   NKI_BUTHND|NKI_BHTOS    install it, if TOS version has mouse click bug (TOS
                           version >= 1.04 and < 3.06)

   If the NKI_BUTHND flag is not set, the handler will not be installed (the
   state of the NKI_BHTOS flag is ignored in this case).

   The second parameter of nkc_init() is the handle of a virtual VDI
   workstation, which had to be opened by NKCC's caller (NKCC uses a VDI
   vex_butv() call). The workstation may not be closed until nkc_exit() was
   called. If the mouse button event handler has not been installed, the
   handle is ignored.

   Another fine feature of the button event handler is an additional flag in
   the event mask: MU_XTIMER. If this flag is set (together with MU_TIMER),
   timer events will only return if no redraw-critical user action is taken
   (like moving windows or sliding through the menu bar). This prevents redraw
   problems, e.g. when the timer event is used to update a mouse coordinate
   display.

   Note: the NKCC button event handler supports the (undocumented) negation
   flag, which is passed in bit 8 of the parameter <bclicks> (maximum # of
   mouse clicks to wait for). You don't know this flag? I found an article
   about it in the c't magazine (I think it was issue 3/90, or maybe 4/90??) -
   and I damned Atari for their bad documentation. This flag opens the way to
   check BOTH mouse buttons at the same time without any problems. When set,
   the return condition is inverted. Let's have a look at an example:

   mask = evnt_multi(MU_BUTTON,2,3,3,...

   This doesn't work the way we want: the return condition is "button #0
   pressed AND button #1 pressed". But look at this:

   mask = evnt_multi(MU_BUTTON,0x102,3,0,...

   Now the condition is "NOT (button #0 released AND button #1 released)". Or
   in other words: "button #0 pressed OR button #1 pressed". Nice, isn't it?!


   Final note: the mouse click bug is fixed since TOS version 3.06.
   Thanks to Atari Corp.!




   8. Other fine extra features
   =============================================================================
   NKCC includes some functions primary built in for its own purposes. However,
   some of this functions could also be useful for the programmers using NKCC,
   so they are exported and documented. Here's a list of them:

   nkc_timer()
      returns the current value of the 200 Hz system clock as unsigned longword.
      The function is very fast, because it just has to copy the value from an
      internal static variable to the return register.

      Note: if NKCC's timer interrupt is not installed, the function will
            always return 0. See chapter 4 for details.

   nkc_kstate()
      returns the current state of the Shift, Control, Alternate and CapsLock
      keys in NKCC compatible format. This function is very fast, too!

   nkc_tconv()
      is the heart of NKCC: the raw key code converter, which transforms a TOS
      key code to the normalized format. However, it does not perform deadkey
      handling, ASCII input or Control key emulation.

   nkc_gconv()
      is a variant of nkc_tconv(), which gets the key code in GEM format (16
      bit integer instead of 32 bit, and NO KEY STATE FLAGS!). nkc_gconv() is
      surely not perfect - but that's no NKCC's fault! The key state flags are
      very very important for proper conversion, and without them, several
      key combinations cannot be distinguished (as meantioned in the first
      chapter of this documentation). Whenever possible, use nkc_tconv()!
      nkc_gconv() is more an emergency exit, which should only be used when the
      key state flags are lost.

   nkc_n2tos()
      converts normalized key codes back to TOS format key codes.

   nkc_n2gem()
      converts normalized key codes back to GEM format key codes.

   nkc_vlink()
      This function links a standard XBRA routine to a vector list. The vector
      can be chosen either as absolute address (e.g. $502 for the hardcopy
      vector) or as number (e.g. $02 for the bus error handler vector).

   nkc_vunlink()
      The counterpart of nkc_vlink(). A function is removed from an XBRA vector
      list.

   nkc_toupper()
      A character is converted to upper case. In contrast to most C compiler
      library functions (ctypes.h) this functions treats foreign language
      characters (e.g. 'Ñ', 'Ç') correctly!

   nkc_tolower()
      The counterpart of the previous function: a character is converted to
      lower case.

   nkc_class()
      Determines the class a character belongs to (e.g. NKC_UPPER = upper
      case letters).

   nkc_strcmp()
      Compares strings with a lot of options: fixed size or NUL-terminated,
      ignore upper/lower case and a different character sort order.


   For a detailed documentation of the functions consult NKCC.TXT.
