The Wizard Demo

I have included the source for
this demo on this disk, that I
used and wrote when re-writing
it.

When I got hold of it, it
wouldn't run on my STE. I could
not be doing with that.

I ended up adding a few routines
to the one it had. It did
already have the option to turn
the sample speed up, but not down
and of course exit.

So I added a few features of my
own:-

Using the key pad (that's the one
on the right, folks!) use the
following:-

+ = Speed up the replay frequency
- = Slows it down (logical, eh!)

0 = This takes a note of the part
    of the sample that is being
    played.

ENTER = When this is pressed, the
        sample will be re-started
        from the position when 0
        was pressed.

( = This will reset the repeat
    marker to the beginning of the
    sample.

) = This will reset the frequency
    to the default.

I also thought it would be a better
idea if the file was in one piece.

I have tested this on a 1/2 meg STFM
and it runeth fine.

There is no reason that the code
couldn't be altered to play other
sample files etc.

The only code I didn't write, well I
think you can work out the lines
which aren't mine.

The picture display, colours  and
general tiding up are mine.

Feel free to use routines for your own
programs if they are of use, give me
the credit if you use any of it.

Please don't recompile and claim to
be the author, people can get very upset
at that practice

For those of you that are interested

There we have it, as everyone says

    'enjoy'

(Does anyone know the reason)
