PLAYBACK-VI

PROGRAMMED BY TRISTAN HUNTING USING
DEVPAC ST
---------------------------------------

    Bring your sampled sounds back to
life with "PLAYBACK". Now you can play
back sounds from BASIC or machine code.
Are you tired of sampled tunes that
accompany the title screen but play no
part in the game. With "PLAYBACK" this
need not be the case. It is interrupt
driven so the whole program need not
stop while you listen to your sounds.
Great for adding a sampled tune or
effects to a game. Sample rate can be
any between 1&16K. Samples of any
format can be played back providing you
know the sample rate and length.
    How you use it. Firstly the machine
code should be loaded into memory. The
code is called "PLAYBACK.C" and is 1032
bytes in length. If you wish to
playback the sounds from within basic
example listings are given in
Fast Basic, GFA Basic and ST Basic.
When running these the ST Format disc
should be left in or else files
"PLAYBACK.SND", and "MGUN.SND" copied
onto the disc you wish to use.
    Certain parameters must be passed
before a sound can be played back. To
do this a variable table is contained
within the program. There are three
variables all of which are long(4
bytes in length). These are

sample address-start address of sound
               sample in memory

sample length -length of sample in
               bytes

sample rate   -value between 1&16
               eg. 1>1000 samples per
               second (1K)
               16>16000 (16K)

    The code once loaded has a GEM
header which should be ignored, to do
this add 28 bytes to find the start
address of the program. The variable
table is situated 984 bytes into the
program. To play a sound the three
above variables should be poked in the
order above into memory, adding 984,
988,992 correspondingly to the start
address of the program. Now the code
can be executed. From within BASIC this
should be done using the "CALL var"
command. Or from machine code as a
subroutine.
IN BRIEF
1) Load file "PLAYBACK.C" at address x
2) Add 28 to x to find start address of
   program
3) Add 984,988,992 to start address of
   program for variables
   sample address,sample length,sample
   rate (correspondingly)
4) Poke values into these variables
5) Execute subroutine at address x
    Remember to use your basics method
of poking long variables to memory. The
biggest limitation with calling sounds
from BASIC is the amount of free memory
available.
    If you wish to include Playback in
your own machine code program, a source
code listing is included. The first 3
of the 4 long variables at the end of
the program at address "vbls" are the
variable table previously described.
Address "smp_cmnd" should be called as
a subroutine to play the sound.
    If you do not own a sound sampler
you can still enjoy "PLAYBACK". With a
little experimentation you can play
back the sounds from your favourite
programs. To do this look through the
files on disc until you find what
appears to be the sound file. Note down
the length of the file. Then load in
this file to your program, and
experiment playing the sound back at
different sample rates until it sounds
right. The procedure for doing this is
described above.
    How it works. "PLAYBACK" uses
timer B(the horizontal blank screen
timer) to generate interrupts. The
program installs an interrupt routine,
which then plays back the sound. When
the sound is completed the interrupt
routine turns itself off. The biggest
limitation I found with using
interrupts was the speed, the highest
rate I could achieve was just under 16K

"PLAYBACK.SND" - Playback sample data
"MGUN.SND"     - Machine gun sample

    The sounds used in the basic demo's
were created and edited using Digisound
They have the following data
"PLAYBACK.SND" - Length 2799 bytes, 
                 sample rate 8K
"MGUN.SND"     - Length 4707 bytes,
                 sample rate 8K
