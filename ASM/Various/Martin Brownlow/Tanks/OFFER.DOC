
  I have recently  released a shareware
game, "GRAV 2".   You can get this game
only (as I write) from  LAPD  or direct
from me. If you  want to order from me,
send œ6.00 to the address  below, and I
will send you  a registered  version of
GRAV 2 along with the disk of "goodies"
that registered users receive.  (Regis-
tration usually costs œ5.00)

  I have also  written a  conversion of
the classic spectrum game, CHAOS, which
is in the public domain. Again, you can
get this from LAPD or from me. To order
from me, send œ2.50 to the address bel-
ow if you are not  a registered user of
GRAV 2, or œ2.00 if you are a register-
ed user of GRAV 2.  If you order a reg-
istered copy of GRAV 2 and CHAOS at the
same  time then it  will only  cost you
œ7.00.
  This conversion of CHAOS  contains 56
(fifty six) samples  using over 750K of
memory.  Because of this,  it will only
run on STs with 1Mb  or more of memory.
The samples are taken from films and TV
series,  and are genuinely  funny,  but
not in the least bit obscene.

  BOTH of these games require a double-
sided disk drive to run!

  Stop press!! Chaos now comes in a mu-
ch cut down 1/2 meg version, with the
same offers and prices as for the mega-
byte version.  Please state which vers-
ion when ordering
