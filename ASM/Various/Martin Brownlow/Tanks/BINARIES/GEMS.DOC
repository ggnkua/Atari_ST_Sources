Welcome to GEMS!

After you've played this game,you might
come away thinking: " Hey, this is just
like that old 8bit Atari game,Diamonds"
and you'd be right!!
  One night I was sitting  around bored
(as usual) looking at my games going -
"Crap, Boring, Finished it, Crap, Worse
than Crap, Boring..." (get the idea?) -
when I thought about an old game called
Diamonds, and all the fun I had playing
it, so I decided to "convert" it to the
ST, since  no such game exists ( except
Boulderdash clones,  which are too slow
- sorry, Boulderdash fans!).  It took a
couple of days to write,the majority of
the time was taken doing the sound (not
that you could tell by hearing it ! ;-)

The Game
--------

The aim  of Gems is  to recover a huge
gem from a set of "mines". Each "mine"
has in it 30 gems in  groups of  4,3,2
and 1.  To  complete a level, you must
collect all the gems on the level.
 As you dig, you leave a trail of tunn-
els behind  you.  To stand in a tunnel,
you  need  to have  either earth  below
you, or earth to either side of you.
 There are several  hazards set against
you.   The first  of these  hazards are
boulders. Boulders will fall down after
a short time if there is no earth below
them.  The second  hazard is the walls.
You cannot tunnel through a wall,but in
every other respect they act as earth.
The other hazards are all "baddies".
These are:

Brian the Blob:
      Brian is the only baddy to tunnel
      He appears on every level.

The Demon
      The Demon appears from the bottom
      of the screen and homes in on you
      He appears on every level.

Every level must be completed 4 times,1
time for each of the following baddies;

Philip the Filler
      Philip  follows  tunnels, filling
      them in after him.

The Fireflies
      These just buzz around the tunne-
      ls aimlessly.

The Eyes
      The eyes follow the  tunnels, but
      they occaisionally  fill in a bit
      as they pass. They cannot be cru-
      shed by falling boulders.

Simon the Snake
      Simon roams about the screen,fil-
      ling in any tunnels he crosses.

Controls
--------

The game is  controlled by the joystick
exactly as expected.

There are three difficulty levels sele-
ctable from the title page  by pressing
left or right to choose before starting

There is a hidden cheat mode accessable
from the title screen!
