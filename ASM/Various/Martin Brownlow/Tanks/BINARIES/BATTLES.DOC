  This is a game for 2 players, the aim
being to blow the crap out of your opp-
onent's ship.  The controls are:

Up     Thrust
Left   Rotate left

Down   Change 1st/2nd weapons
Fire   FIre weapon

The bars on the  bottom of  the  screen
represent ammo, fuel and damage in that
order. If the ammo bar is red, then the
primary weapon is being used.  If it is
orange the secondary weapon is in use.
