                 TANX
                 -++-

 The aim of tanx is simple;  blow your
opponent to bits! To acheive this, you
must shoot over the mountain with your
tank's cannon.
 You have a limited number of shots to
play with, but you can gain extra ammo
by shooting birds.
  Every so often,  one of three things
will fly across the top of the screen.
The first of these is the flying sauc-
er.  This drops shots at you as it pa-
sses.   Killing the flying  saucer has
no effect  on  a player.   The next of
these is the ST.  Shoot this  ;-(  and
you will get all your damage repaired!
The final thing is the SMILEY!  Hitti-
ng this will cause one of  the special
damage  effects ( see below ) on  your
tank!!!
  If  you get hit,  a random amount of
damage is done to your tank, and there
is a chance of a special damage effect

These are:

Fire;   
	Your tank catches fire and you
        are reduced to half speed 'til
        it is extinguished.
Gun jam;
        Your tank's  gun jams, and you
        may not fire until it is repa-
        ired.
Turret jam;
        The turret on your  tank jams,
        and you may not alter its ang-
        le until repaired.
Tracks jam;
        Ooops; sitting duck!
        No movement until repaired.
        
In order to repair special damage, sim-
ply remain still  and do not  touch the
controls for a while.   The only effect
which you can see being repaired is the
fire, which dies down as it is repaired

Controls
--------

Up     raise turret
Down   lower turret
Left   move left
Right  move right

Pressing 'a' will restart the game with
a new mountain,useful if it is too big,
or if you both run out of ammo.

* To fire, hold fire while the power bar
rises to where you want it, then let go!

Have fun!
