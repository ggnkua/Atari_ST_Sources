WELCOME TO THE WOLFS THIRD CUSTOM SUPPLIED MENU (PLEASE FIND ENCLOSED MY BILL FOR OVERTIME HOURS WORKED ETC.).  BY THE WAY  IVE GOT TOTAL RECALL TOO....

IF YOU DO WANT TO CHANGE THE PALETTE COLOURS CHANGE THE ONES IN THE FONT FILE (16 16 03.NEO) COS THATS WHERE MY PROGGY LOOKS FOR ITS COLOURS)...........        WELL, MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE I WROTE THE BIT OF THE SCROLLER YOUVE JUST READ (SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT NEEDING AN APOSTROPHE?) AND IM NOW PRETTY CERTAIN THAT THIS PROGGY WORKS 100 PER CENT (AND A PERCENT SIGN?) (AND A COMMA...)  SO IM GOING TO COMPILE IT (COMMA) COMPRESS IT (COMMA) TEST IT AND THEN ZAP IT TO YOU.....     I(APOSTROPHE)VE ALSO INCLUDED A PROGGY CALLED MAKEBOOT WHICH (SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH) MAKES A BOOTSECTOR - JUST A BOG STANDARD FADEOUT ONE.  IT COMES WITH FAIRLY SELF EXPLANATORY INSTRUCTIONS AND I CANT BE BOTHERED TO ADD ANY MORE NOW (ITS LATE (COMMA) IM TIRED AND IVE GOT LOADS OF WORK TO DO (PROPER WORK......).
