I'D LIKE TO MENTION SOME GROUPS WHO MADE
DEMOS WHICH WON'T FEATURE ON THE DISKS :

 - FUZION
    (YOUR UPPER/LOWER BORDER ROUTINE
     DIDN'T WORK ON MY SHIFTERS)
 - MCS
    (YOUR SECOND SCREEN WAS TOO BUGGED)
 - SAMOS
    (FUCKING $466,
     BUT COOL SNORK DEMO-PARTY)
 - TRIO
    (YOU USED SYSTEM TRAPS)
 - ZUUL
    (YOUR SCREEN WAS TOO BIG)

THE RELEASE DATE OF THIS DISK
 IS 06/15/91.
AT THE MOMENT, THE FIRST DISK ISN'T
YET FINISHED BUT IT WILL BE IN 1 OR 2
 WEEKS (BE PATIENT).

DON'T FORGET THAT THIS DISK IS
 THE SECOND DISK, AND THAT THE FIRST ONE
CONTAINS ALL THE SCREENS WHICH WON
A PRIZE AT THE TRANSBEAUCE 2.
