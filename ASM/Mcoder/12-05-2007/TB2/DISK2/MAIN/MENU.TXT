         HI, GUYZZZ!           THIS IS THE TRANSBEAUCE DEMO 2 - SECOND PART - THE LESSER DEMOS /          USE THE CURSOR "UP# AND "DOWN# KEYS TO CHOOSE THE SCREENS           THIS CRAP MENU WAS CODED BY THE SHAMEFUL -DOGUE DE MAUVE/ FROM OVERLANDERS, ALSO WRITING THIS SCROLLER.            THE NICE GRAPHIX ARE BY -BABAR/ (SPRITES AND BACKGROUND), -SPEEDLIGHT/ (TRANSBEAUCE 2 LOGO AND SCROLLFONT) AND -THE SERGEANT/ (DEMO LOGOS).            THE MARVELLOUS MUSIC (ONE OF MY ALL-TIMES FAVOURITE) IS BY -MAD MAX/.            THE DEMO GATHERING WAS MADE BY THE MEGAMIGHTY -MCODER/ WHILE THE LOADER SHOULD BE BY -GENESIS/ ('HOPE I'M NOT WRONG)...         FOR THE UNFORTUNATE FELLOWS THAT WERE NOT AT THE -TRANSBEAUCE 2/, HERE ARE A FEW IMPRESSIVE STATISTICS (COURTESY OF -THE SERGEANT/ AND THE C.I.A : CONVENTIONS INSTITUTE OF ATARI ST)...           AT THE -TRANSBEAUCE 2/ THERE WERE :           -250 PEOPLE/ (INCLUDING SOME THAT WERE NOT INVITED BUT -THE SERGEANT/ WAS TOO KIND TO SEND THEM OUT)          ABOUT -100 ATARI COMPUTERS/ (AND 2 POOR AMIGAS !)          THE AMOUNT OF COCA-COLA AND VARIOUS FOOD CONSUMED WAS -INCREDIBLE !!!/          AS FOR THE ENERGY, WE USED ABOUT -1 MEGA WATT/ IN ONLY 24 HOURS !          FINALLY, -THE SERGEANT/ WOULD LIKE TO SEND HIS BEST THANX TO EVERYBODY WHO CAME TO THIS "LABOUR DAY# PARTY.          I PERSONNALLY RECKON THIS WAS A GREAT CONVENTION, THOUGH THERE WERE A REALLY BLOODY BIG CROWD AND SOME DRUNK "NUISANCES# (SEE WHAT I MEAN ?)           I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH -THE SERGEANT/ AND HIS WHOLE TEAM WHO ACTUALLY MADE A HELL OF A GREAT JOB ON THIS MEETING. THIS WAS, IN MY OPINION, THE BEST CONVENTION EVER ORGANIZED IN FRANCE. THANX, BOYS (AND GIRLS) !           I WILL ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE WRITER OF THIS SCROLLER TO SEND SOME PARTICULAR GREETINGS TO THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE :           THE OVERLANDERS WHO TRAVELLED FROM FAR TO COME HERE : -DIM/, -PIB/, -SPEEDLIGHT/, -TYPHON/, -XBIOS MEN/, -MR BEE/ AND A SPECIAL MENTION TO -FURYO/ WHO HAD TO DRIVE ME HOME AFTER 72 HOURS WITHOUT SLEEP... ALSO "HI !# TO THE FRIENDS THEY EVENTUALLY BROUGHT WITH THEM.          THE PENDRAGONS (THAT WAS A REAL PLEASURE TO SEE YOU THERE... EXCEPT THAT -TERENCE/ KEPT ON RUNNING DEMOS HE SHOULDN'T !)          -OXYGENE/ (GREAT NEW FRENCH CREW ! SPECIAL "HI !# TO -LEONARD/)          THE SILVERS (WHO CAME ALONG WITH ME AND PROVIDED ME WITH LOTSA HARDWARE THESE LAST WEEKS - I REALLY OWE YOU MUCH, GUYS !)          THE CYBERNETICS (GREAT WORK !)          ST CONNEXION (OEUF CORSE !)          AND ALL OTHER FRIENDLY PEOPLE I TALKED TO (I'M SURE THEY'LL RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES !)          LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THANX TO YOU FOR READING THIS SINCE I RECKON THIS MAIN MENU ISN'T WORTH A DIME (I HAD TO CODE IT AS AN "EMERGENCY PROGRAM# AND I'M NOTHING BUT A F.CKING BAD ASSEMBLER NOVICE PROGRAMMER YET).          ALSO THANX TO -MCODER/ FOR HANDLING THE WHOLE (AND MOSTLY BORING) ASSEMBLY OF THE DEMOS.          FINALLY, A BIG "HI !# TO -JAMBON/ FROM A FAMOUS ENOUGH FRENCH CREW...          SEE YOU IN THE "VENTURA DEMO# MAIN MENU !           MAY THE MAUVE BE WITH YOU ALL...              WAP DOU WARP!
