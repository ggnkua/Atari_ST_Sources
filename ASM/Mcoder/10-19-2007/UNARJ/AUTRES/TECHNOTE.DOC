     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************

     There is an extended header bug in older versions of ARJ, AV.C and
     UNARJ.C.  The extended header processing in read_header() should
     skip 4 bytes for the extended header CRC and not 2.  This is NOT a
     current problem as no versions of ARJ use the extended header.

     Modification history:
     Date      Description of modification:
     --------  ------------------------------------------------------
     06/28/91  Added several new HOST OS numbers.
     05/19/91  Improved the description of extended header processing.
     05/11/91  Simplified this document.  Added volume label type.
     03/11/91  Added directory file type.
     02/23/91  Added more comments.
     01/10/91  Corrected timestamp description and header order of file mode.
     10/30/90  Corrected values of flags in ARJ flags.


     ARJ archives contains two types of header blocks:

	Archive main header - This is located at the head of the archive
	Local file header   - This is located before each archived file

     Structure of archive block (low order byte first):

     Bytes Description
     ----- -------------------------------------------------------------------
       2   header id (main and local file) = 0xEA60 or 60000U
       2   basic header size (from 'first_hdr_size' thru 'comment' below)
		 = first_hdr_size + strlen(filename) + 1 + strlen(comment) + 1
		 = 0 if end of archive

       1   first_hdr_size (size up to and including 'extra data')
       1   archiver version number
       1   minimum archiver version to extract
       1   host OS   (0 = MSDOS, 1 = PRIMOS, 2 = UNIX, 3 = AMIGA, 4 = MAC-OS)
		     (5 = OS/2, 6 = APPLE GS, 7 = ATARI ST, 8 = NEXT)
		     (9 = VAX VMS)
       1   arj flags (0x01 = GARBLED_FLAG) indicates passworded file
		     (0x02 = RESERVED)
		     (0x04 = VOLUME_FLAG)  indicates continued file to next
					   volume
		     (0x08 = EXTFILE_FLAG) indicates file starting position
					   field
		     (0x10 = PATHSYM_FLAG) indicates path translated
					   ("\" changed to "/")
       1   method    (0 = stored, 1 = compressed most ... 4 compressed fastest)
       1   file type (0 = binary, 1 = 7-bit text, 2 = comment header)
		     (3 = directory, 4 = volume label)
       1   reserved
       4   date time modified
       4   compressed size
       4   original size (this will be different for text mode compression)
       4   original file's CRC
       2   filespec position in filename
       2   file access mode
       2   host data (currently not used)
       ?   extra data
	   4 bytes for extended file starting position when used
	   (this is present when EXTFILE_FLAG is set)

       ?   filename (null-terminated string)
       ?   comment  (null-terminated string)

       4   basic header CRC

       2   1st extended header size (0 if none)
       ?   1st extended header (currently not used)
       4   1st extended header's CRC (not present when 0 extended header size)

       ...

       ?   compressed file


     Time stamp format:

	31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16
       |<---- year-1980 --->|<- month ->|<--- day ---->|

	15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3	2  1  0
       |<--- hour --->|<---- minute --->|<- second/2 ->|



     Compression methods:


     ARJ methods 1 to 3 use Lempel-Ziv 77 sliding window with static Huffman
     encoding.

     ARJ method 4 uses Lempel-Ziv 77 sliding window with pointer/length
     unary encoding.

     There is one decoder for methods 1 to 3 and one decoder for method 4.



     Encryption technology:


     ARJ does NOT use DES encryption algorithms.  It uses a combination of
     simple exclusive-or operations.
