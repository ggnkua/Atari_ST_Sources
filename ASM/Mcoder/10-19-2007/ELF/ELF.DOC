				Hello,


Here are some explanations of how I use the replay routine on ST.

First, the replay routine is totally relocatable (except the address
of the keyboard which is used in the replay -IF YOU USE IT-).

All the musics are only image files and I play them like that :

		LEA	MUSIC,A0

		CMP.L	LASTMUS,A0	;avoid to restart the music
		BEQ.S	.NONEW
		MOVE.L	A0,LASTMUS
		JSR	REPLAY+0	;init replay routine
					;(all registers are destroyed)
	.NONEW

and in the VBL routine :

		JSR	REPLAY+4	;play the sound
					;(all registers are destroyed)

	MUSIC:	INCBIN	FILE.MUS	;the music file

The only way to stop a music is to clear volume registers :
		MOVE.L	#$08080000,$FFFF8800.W
		MOVE.L	#$09090000,$FFFF8800.W
		MOVE.L	#$0A0A0000,$FFFF8800.W

All the sounds (13 sounds of Toki) are included in the replay routine.
I play a sound with only one instruction :
		MOVE	#NUMBER,replay+10	;msndf variable !!!
There is a big trick here, because at the same time I clear the MSNDF
flag which is the flag of restart-sound and I put the number of the sound
in SNDEFF.

In the case you would translate the replay routine to another assembly,
 don't hesitate to contact me.

The musics were converted by Pierre-Eric Loriaux, and the replay made
by JCM on the ST.
