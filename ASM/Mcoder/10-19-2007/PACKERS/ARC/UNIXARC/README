This is a Unix System V version of arc that seems to work fine for all
the cases I have tried.  I considered at one point porting it to the
Amiga, as I have never liked that fact that the source to the "official
Amiga version" was not available.  But such a project is rather low on
my priority list.

Since this code is derived from the original Arc sources, it is subject
to the same limitations and restrictions as the PC/CPM versions, despite
the posting to usenet.  That's why I have included it on this shareware
disk rather than one of my normal disks (I charge no fee for the shareware
disks).

If you have a Unix system in addition to your Amiga, you should find this
useful.
