When the UNIX  version of ARC was posted a while ago, I brought it up on
our systems here. Unlike a recent poster to this newsgroup, I had no
problem with the Lempel-Ziv (crunch) code, but never could get it to
correctly squeeze or unsqueeze a file in an archive.

Reading the source code, I noticed that the squeeze/unsqueeze code on ARC
is based on an earlier version of the recently-posted portable SQ/USQ
programs. Using code from that program I was able to fix the problem with
ARC not correctly unsqueezing a file in the archive (creating either a
zero-length file or giving the 'invalid decode tree' message).

NOTE: I am still having problems with the squeeze code on our system. For
some reason, trying to archive a file which would normally be squeezed on
the MS-DOS version of ARC results in it being compressed with some
less-efficient method. I think this is a bug, but it appears to be a
harmless one.

Context diffs for the unsqueeze fix follow:

	Actually, I know a lot about what turns a woman off.
	Now, if I could just stop doing it I'd be all set.
