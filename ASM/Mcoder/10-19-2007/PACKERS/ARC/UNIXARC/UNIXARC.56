There is a bug in the recently distributed Unix ARC that will cause
it to fail when extracting long files, in partcular, files whose
size cannot be expressed as a 16 bit quantity.

The problem is in the dos2long conversion in arcunix.c.

The offending code as it originally appears

#define dos2long(x) ((unsigned char)(x)[0] + ((unsigned char)(x)[1]<<8) + \
		((unsigned char)(x)[2]<<16) + \ ((unsigned char)(x)[3]<<24))


will shift (x)[2] and (x)[3] straight into the bit bucket.  I just casted
them to long to rectify the problem.

#define dos2long(x) ((unsigned char)(x)[0] + ((unsigned char)(x)[1]<<8) + \
		((long)(unsigned char)(x)[2]<<16) + \
                ((long)(unsigned char)(x)[3]<<24))

----
arc now appears to run fine under SCO Xenix.
