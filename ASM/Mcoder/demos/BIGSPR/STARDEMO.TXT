                 ALORS VOILA,C'EST FAIT,NOUS L'AVONS ENFIN FINI !!!!! CA A ETE DURE MAIS ON Y EST ARRIVE . BON,ASSEZ
PARLE FRANCAIS AND LET'S TALK IN ENGLISH (OR WHAT'S LOOK LIKE...) !!!!    SO,AS I SAID BEFORE,IT WAS HARD BUT WE HAVE SUCCEED IN MAKING
THIS USEFUL DEMO( THE FIRST ON ST !!! ) OF WHAT,US,THE STARFIRES(OR TST,AS YOU LIKE) , CAN DO ON THAT BLOODY ATARI ST.
OF COURSE THIS IS LESS , HOW CAN I SAY THAT...  OH YES!   IT'S LESS DISTROY THAN THE CAREBEARS  DEMOS (LET'S REMENBER THEIR CLUDDY DEMO,
EXEPT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY ON OLD SHIFTERS (ET PAN!,DANS LES DENTS) !!!) BUT I THINK THAT THE FEW DEMOS WHICH ARE ON THIS DISK
ARE AS GOOD THAN THEIRS.... AND PERHAPS BETTER (IT'S NO PROBLEM FOR US!).      WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE ENJOY THIS DEMO !!!         
BUT NOW,LET'S TALK ABOUT 'TRUCS ET ASTUCES 2' ITSELF.........        THERE IS A LONG TIME THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE THIS PROGAMM,OUR LAST ONE(FOR GLOOSH AND ME,FIFIRE,WE'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER...)
 THIS DEMO IS,IN FACT,COMPOSED INTO TWO PARTS....  THE FIRST ONE IS TA2 ITSELF AND THE SECOND IS ALL THE DEMO PROGRAMMS.     TA2 ( TRUCS ET ASTUCES 2 ) IS VERY EASY TO
USE...  YOU JUST HAVE TO DO LIKE IN THE GEMDOS. FOR THE DEMO-SCREENS, JUST LOAD THEM BY PRESSING THE RIGHT NUMBER IN THE MAIN MENU. IF YOU WANT TO EXIT A DEMO SCREEN,JUST PRESS THE RESET BUTTON.
   TO MAKE THIS PROGRAMM WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS.  FIRST IT WAS THE TIME ( MAKING A PROGRAMM NEEDS A LOT
OF TIME) WE CAN'T COMPUT ALL THE NIGHT LOST IN IT ( WHEN YOU GO TO BED AT 2 AM AND YOU HAVE TO GET UP AT 6 AM TO GO TO SCHOOL...    YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOME OF THEM FELL
ASLEEP DURING MATHEMATICS LESSON OR PHILOSOPHICAL'S ONES... ) , THE SECOND PROBLEM WAS , AS ALWAYS , THE SCHOOL (FUCK...FUCK...FUCK !!! ) , IN FRANCE WE WORK AT SCHOOL ABOUT 8 HOURS PER DAYS ( FIFIRE (ME)
HAS 2 HOURS MORE FOR THE TRAVEL ( BY TRAIN ) ) .  WE AREN'T LIKE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY WHICH WORK ONLY 4 OR 5 HOURS PER DAYS ( BANDES DE FUMISTES !!!!! )... AND SOME OF THEN HAVE HAD AN
EXAM AT THE END OF THE YEAR ( AS TOMSTAR AND FIFIRE ).      THIS YEAR,IT'S THE SAME THING...       THE LAST PROBLEM WAS THAT WE WEREN'T VERY GOOD CODERS.      BUT ONE DAY,AS WE WERE DESESPERATED,THE
REINCARNATION OF GOD APPEARED IN FRONT OF US... IT WAS THE GREAT,THE FAMOUS,THE MARVELOUS,THE MEGAMIGHTY :  MCODER       WHEN HE SAW US HE SAID:' CASSER VOUS BANDES DE NAZES ET LAISSEZ MOI FAIRE !!'
 ( HE IS A VERY POETIC BOY...)  AND WITH HIS HELP WE HAVE START TO MAKE LOVELY DEMOS.............    IN THIS DISK THERE IS MORE THAN 200 STUFFS FOR GAMES AND BETWEEN 300 OR 400 KO OF TEXTS ( THEY WERE ALL
WRITEN BY FIFIRE , THE LOOSY MAIN MENU WAS DONE BY FIFIRE , THE GRAPHIXXS BY GLOOSH AND FIFIRE AND THE DEMOS BY MCODER AND FIFIRE...      WE THANX THE OTHER MEMBERS ( ARE THEY MEMBERS ??? ) , TOMSTAR AND RICUS FOR THEIR IMPORTANT
MORAL SUPPORT ( HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,I'M LAUGHTING,HAHAHAHAHA !!!!!).  WE HAVE MADE THIS PROGRAMM WITH THE HELP OF THE   S.P.Y.J.A.C.K. CIE   ,WE REALLY WANT TO THANX THEM (HELLO SPY3 AND MAXI !!!) FOR THEIR PRECIOUS
HELP ( MOSTLY FOR THE SIERRA ON LINE'S GAMES ANSWERD ).  THERE IS ONE YEAR THAT THEY'RE WAITING THE END OF THIS PROGRAMM , I HOPE THEY WON'T BE DISAPOINTED...     
WE ALSO WANT TO GREET ( LET'S GO FOR THE TRADITIONNAL GREETINGS ! ) :  TOUBAB  FOR IS GOOD WORK ON ST ( KEEP ON BOY !) , GILLUS(OR GL) YOU ARE A GOOD FELLOW (C'EST BIEN MAIS TU PEUX ENCORE FAIRE MIEUX...) , ARIOCH

LIKE TO KNOW WHY SOME GROUP PUT FUCK-GREETINGS INTO THEIR SCROLL ???       IT'S STUPID !!   OF COURSE,SOME PEOPLE NEED TO BE 'FUCK' SOMETIME,BUT NOT TO MUCH...    PERHAPS THEY ARE STUPID (MORE STUPID THAN YOU ?
) , PERHAPS THEY ARE ROBBERS,LAMERS,LOOSERS,BUT IT'S NOT A REASON TO FUCK THEM ALL THE TIME(THEY MUST BE COMPLETLY WEAK AT THE END...).         NOW WE HAVE A MESSAGE TO SEND TO    THE A.P.P. (ORGANISATION AGAINST
 CRACKER GROUPS).      IT'S A SAD JOB YOU MAKE,BOYS!!!     TO ARREST TEENAGERS PUT THEM IN JAIL OR ASK THEM MONEY...    WELL,THAT'S SAD AND USELESS,IT'S A BAD JOB YOU DO.    THE WORTH IS THAT IT'S COMPLETLY
USELESS.    IF YOU'D REALLY WANNA ARREST ALL CRACKED GAMES USERS,YOU'D HAVE TO ARREST ALL THE ST USERS !!                  NOW I GIVE THE KEYBOARD TO GLOOSH                 NOW,IT'S THE TURN TO MCODER

FOR A JOB OF GRAPHIXS MAKERS IN A CREW. IR'S HIM WHO HAD MADE THE LOVELY STARSHIP ( THE SHIP WHIT A TOILET SHAPE !!) WHICH CROSS THE SCREEN SOMETIME.   HE IS A QUITE GOOD GRAPHIST,SO IF YA'RE INTERESED,CONTACT US.          
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROJECT FOR THE FUTUR... BUT NOT ON ST.             WE HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ATARI ST TO GO ON ARCHIMEDE.           WELL,I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT...     NO ! WE AREN'T CRASY!!
THERE'S A LONG TIME AGO THAT WE WANNA GO ON THIS MACHINE.        OK THERE'S LESS PROGRAMMS ON IT THAN ON ST OR ON AMIGA BUT WHEN WE HAVE USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME,GLOOSH AND ME,WERE VERY SURPRISE BY THE POWER OF
THIS COMPUTER.  IN TWO HOURS WE HAVE PROGRAMMED A SCROLLER WHICH SCROLLED A PICTURE IN 640-256 IN 256 COLORS,WITH A 256-100 IN 256 COLORS SPRITE...     WELL,WE HAVE DONE IT IN...   BASIC (WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF ASSEMBLER.)
!!       THE SCROLLER WAS AN HORIZONTAL
 ONE.      THE SOUNDSHIP OF THIS COMPUTER IS BETTER THAN THE STE ONE(AN THE AMIGA ONE...).  YOU CAN MAKE MUSIC IN 8 VOICES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM(AND TO DO WHAT YOU WANT DURING THIS TIME...  COZ THE HARDWARE.) .   THIS COMPUTER SPEED IS: 4MIPS-8MIPS 
       NOT SO BAD ISN'T IT...    SO WE HAVE DECIDED
GLOOSH AND ME TO GO ON THIS 'MACHINE' (MCODER STAY ON ST.).     NOW WE ARE GOING TO GREET SOME GUYS ON ARCHI:   
 HI TO MOURNBLADE , ARCHIMAN , AGORA , CUTHAGA , RATBOY (HELLO !) , ACORN , CRAZY-WIMP , AND ALL I FORGOT...              BUT LET'S COME BACK ON 
THAT BLOODY ST(BEURK !)...           WELL,WE HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING(LIKE OMEGA...)       THERE IS NO CREW ON ST WHO MAKES GOOD GRAPHIXS,I MEAN VERY GOOD PICTURES.          FOR THE MUSICS WE HAVE MAD-MAX( HI ! ) , DAVE WITTACKER
, ROBB HUBBART.             FOR PROGRAMMS WE HAVE THE TCB (AND ALL THE MEMBER OF THE UNION) AND OF COURSE US (THE STARFIRES... YEEAAAA !!)        BUT FOR THE GRAPHIXS,IT NOT THE CASE ...    THERE IS NOBODY !        THIS IS A BIG 
PROBLEM , TO UNDERSTAND THAT , JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE TCB'S DEMOS ...         THEY'RE TECHNICALY PERFECT (WELL   NOT SO PERFECT... THEY COULD DO 'MUCHO' BETTER !) , BUT THE PICTURES ARE VERY POOR...  THIS ALWAYS THE SAME LETTERS 
, ETC...        SO,WE SEND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE :    ' IF YA'RE A GOOD GRAPHIST,DON'T BE AFRAID TO CONTACT A CREW !!   THEY HAVE NEVER ATE ANYBODY(IN GENERAL...). '     I THINK THE OTHER CREW WILL BE AGREE WITH WHAT I'M SAYING , ISN'T ??  
              WELL,ARE YOU ALWAYS HERE ?       NOT ASLEEP 
YET ?      DO YOU LIKE THIS SCREEN(CALLED STAR'S DEMO)? PERHAPS A BIT BORING,ISN'T IT ?     IF YOU ARE INTERESTING IN CONTACT US,I'LL TELL YA HOW TO DO LATER(AT THE END OF THIS SCROLLTEXT... DON'T WORRY,IT'S NEARLY 
FINISHED !)      IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS ALREADY,WE ARE NOT CRACKERS,JUST CODERS OR LAMERS(ISN'T IT TOMSTAR,RICUS ???),WE ARE TOGETHER LIVING IN THE SAME TOWN(EXEPT MCODER WHO LIVE 5KM FROM OUR TOWN),IT'S A LOVELY 
TOWN  WITH ITS LITTLE HOUSES,ITS BUILDINGS AND ITS GHETTOS...             WE LIVED AT 35KM FROM PARIS('HAAAA PPAAARRRRISSSS,ITS EFFEL-TOWER,ITS 'CHAMPS ELISE',ITS PRETTY GIRLS....' YOU KNOW,GIRLS'NEIGHBOUR ARE ALWAY BETTER
 THAN OURS...  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN ?  NO ? DON'T WORRY,IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT,IT'S MAYBE TO PHILOSOPHICAL FOR YOU...) 
    WE ARE ALL BETWEEN 16 AND 24 YEARS OLD.      WE DON'T EAT FROG(ONLY FOR BREAKFAST...),SNAIL(JUST FOR THE BREAK,AT 5 PM...)
 WE DON'T DRINK COKE BUT WINE(HAHAHA !!),AND WE ARE ALWAYS WEARING A BERET ON OUR HEADS, CARRING A PIECE OF BREAD IN THE LEFT HAND AND A BOTTLE OF WINE IN THE RIGHT ONE..... AHAHAHAHAHA  I WAS JOKING !!!   THAT 
STUPID YOU'RE THINKING ?  WELL I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY,SO...                BUT NOW,LET'S SPEAK ABOUT THE 'NEW' ATARI ST .... I MEAN THE ATARI STE.         WELL,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT ??   HAVE YOU ALREADY 
SAW ONE ?   WELL,IF YOU DON'T,I'M GOING TO DESCRIB IT TO YOU.             SO,LET'S GO         WELL,YOU SEE THE COMPUTER IN WHICH YOU HAVE LOADED THIS DEMO ?  WELL,THE NEW ATARI STE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME 'LOOK'.   WHEN 
I SAY EXACTLY,I SAY THAT IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME,THE ONLY THINGS WHICH CHANGE ARE THE TWO OTHER JOYSTICK PLUNGS AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THIS COMPUTER...    THAT ALL !       OOPS,I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT INSTEAD OF PRINT ATARI 520
STF THERE IS    ATARI 520STE .  IT'S COMPETLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLD ATARI STF.         WELL,IN FACT IT'S NOT SO COMPATIBLE...   A LOT OF GAMES DON'T WORK PROPELY ON IT(ABOUT 40 PERCENT !) AND MOST OF THE DEMOS
BUG ON IT...     THIS ONE TOO (I HAVEN'T TRY...).     THE SOUNDSHIP IS BETTER THAN THE 'STF' ONE ( BUT IT'S WORST THAN THE AMIGA ONE,AND OF COURSE WORST THAN THE ARCHIMEDE ONE !).     THE GRAPHIX ARE THE SAME
 EXEPT THAT YOU HAVE 4096 COLORS INSTEAD OF 512 (BUT ALWAYS 16 COLORS IN LOW RESOLUTION...).       THERE IS A BLITTER IN IT AND SOME HARDWARE SCROLLERS ( LIKE THE AMIGA BUT 4 YEARS LATER !).        
   THE R.O.M. OF THAT NEW COMPUTER IS COMPETLY BUGGED,FOR EXEMPLE,YOU CAN BOOT WITH A DESKTOP.INF WHICH PUT THE ST IN MEDIUM RESOLUTION (IT'S STILL IN LOW),THERE IS SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE DISK ACCESS,ETC.       
IN FACT THIS COMPUTER IS STILL UNDER THE AMIGA (FOR THE GRAPHISM,THE MUSIC...)     I HOPE THAT THE T.T.  ( THE TRANSPUTOR FROM ATARI )  WILL BE BETTER...      I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE STE IS A BIG CHEAT (...),I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT'S JUST
LIKE THE OLD ST AND THAT IT GIVE US NOTHING MORE.........             ALWAYS READING THAT SCROLL ????         ARE YOU COURAGEOUS OR      STUPID...                   IN THE MAIN MENU OF THIS DISK (BEURK !) YOU CAN CHOOSE THE SCREEN YOU
 WANT TO SEE BETWEEN 7.             WELL,IN FACT THERE ARE 9 DIFFERENT DEMOS....      YYYEEEEEAAAAAA !!!!!  YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD,THERE IS 2 HIDDEN SCREENS !!!     BUT DONT WORRY,THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT.      IN THE FIRST ONE I GREET THE SPYJACK-CIE (
HAVE YOU TRYED ALL THE NUMBERS... 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ???)        AND IN THE SECOND ONE...      WELL        I GIVE MY ADRESS,AND SAY FEW INTERESSANT THINGS...       GOOD LUCK TO FIND IT !!                  BUT NOW,LET'S CHANGE  OF SUBJECT.     
HAVE YOU ALREADY SEEN 'THE GENIUS HAS NO BORDER DEMO'      WELL,WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ?     SURPRISING,ISN'T IT ?    AND IT WORK ON ALL SHIFTERS.      DO YOU THINK SOMEONE WILL BEAT IT A DAY ?      WELL,ACCORDING TO ME,THAT NOT SURE,NOT SURE AT 
ALL.       HEY,THE CAREBEARS !!  TRY TO BEAT OUR FULLSCREEN DEMO !!!   AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA       OUR FULLSCREENDEMO WAS DONE BY MCODER AND FIFIRE.           AND HAVE YOU SEEN THE BOUNCINGBALLS-DEMO ?????       IT'S THE DEMO WHICH MOVES THE MOST 
OF SPRITE ON ST (121 SPRITES IN 16.16,IN 2 BITMAP. BUT IF WE REMOVE THE SCROLLERS,WE CAN PUT 11 BOULDERS MORE.).         SOME OF THE DEMOS WHICH ARE ON THIS DISK ARE GOOD,THE OTHER ARE QUITE LOOSY 
(AS THE BIG-ONE DEMO,3D-GROUND DEMO),IF THEY'RE BAD IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE OLD.                STILL READING ???
        DO YOU THINK THIS SCROLLING IS A BIT TO FAST ??        NOT EASY TO READ ISN'T IT ?       YEEAAAA,I UNDERSTAND,IT'S THE DISTORTION WHICH MAKE 
IT HARD TO READ (ARRGGGG,MY ENGLISH IS VERY BAD,ISN'T IT. I HAVE A BIG COMPLEX WITH ME ENGLISH...)                 NOW I'AM GOING TO TELL YO
U A STORY,IT A QUITE FUNNY STORY AS YOU'LL GO TO SEE.          THERE IS A FEW TIME AGO , A PERSONNAL COMPUTER SHOW HAVE BEEN ORGANISED IN FRANCE,IT WAS IN OCTOBER .    ANYWAY,WE HAVE DECIDED TO GO HERE ,TO HAVE A LOOK...     WHEN I SAY  'WE',I MEAN 
 GLOOSH AND ME.       SO,WE HAVE TOOK THE TRAIN AND AFTER HALF AN HOUR , WE ARRIVED IN PARIS.    OF COURSE WE LOST USELF IN THE SUBWAY (THAT'S LOGICAL...).   WE HAVE WAITING DURING ONE HOUR BEFORE TO ENTER THE COMPUTEUR SHOW.        WE WERE ALREADY 
WALKING IN THE SHOW SINCE 1 HOUR WHEN GLOOSH CALLED ME AND SHOWN ME A DEMO MADE BY A CREW THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAME ( HEMMM ).   SO,I LOOK AT THE DEMO AND SAID TO GLOOSH  ' HAHAHA THAT A LOOSY DEMO !!!,LOOK AT THE SCROLLER AHAHAH !!!',AND GLOOS
H REPLIED  'YES, AHAHA, AND LOOK AT THE COLORS,THEY'RE HORRIBLE,HAHAHA'   WE WERE SO BUSY TO LAUGHT THAT WE HADN'T NOTICED THE MAN WHO WAS JUST BEHIND US...    'AND LISTEN TO THAT LOOSY DIGIT MUSAK,IT'S MUST BE A DIGIT IN 7.5MHZ HAHAH'    AT
 THIS MOMENT,THE MAN WHO WAS BEHIND US START TO SPEAK AND TOLD US  'HELLO,HOW DO YOU FIND THE DEMO I HAVE CODE ??'       I REALLY LOOKED ANGRY ( WHY ? I DON'T SEE WHY ...).        GLOOSH AND ME WERE VERY SURPRISED,BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T NOTICED THE
MAN BEFORE...    IT WAS SURE THAT HE HAD HEARD ALL WE HAVE SAID...    'WELL,HEMM,IT'S ,HEM,HOW CAN I SAY THAT... WELL,IT'S A QUITE NICE ONE...   HEM,WELL    BYE BYE SIR,SEE YOU SOON ! '  GLOOSH REPLIED,AND WE LEFT THE MAN...  HE WAS VERY ANGRY.
    THERE 
WERE PRETTY GIRLS TOO , IN THAT COMPUTER SHOW (HELLO NATHALIE !!)...            EXEPT GIRLS,THIS COMPUTER SHOW WAS NOT VERY GOOD,IT WAS TOO SMALL.                BUT DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE ONLY INTERESTED BY COMPUTERS AND GIRLS 
(WELL,NOT ONLY...).       WE ARE 
ALSO INTERESTED IN MUSIC.        EACH OF US LIKE A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC THAN THE OTHER.     DO YOU WANT AN EXEMPLE ?      OK,GLOOSH LIKE DEPECHE-MODE,MCODER ART OF NOISE,FIFIRE BACH,VIVALDI,MOZART AND DEPECHE-MODE TOO(NO BODY IS PERFECT !)
, THE ONLY ONE WHO HAVE
 A STRANGE TOAST IS RICUS...  HE LOVES RAPP AND HOUSE MUSIC.      I REMENBER SOME COPY PARTY AT RICUS HOME,IN WHICH,DURING 5 HOURS YOU HAD TO SUPPORT THOSE SORT OF NOISE (OOPS,I MEAN MUZAK !).....  BEURKKK      WHEN YOU ESCAPED FROM THAT HELL,
YOU THAUGH THAT YOUR HEAD WAS GOING TO BLAST !!!  THAT WAS HORRIBLE.      BUT THE MOST HORRIBLE WAS WHEN RICUS STARTED TO SHOW US THE NEW MUSIC HE MADE ON HIS SYNTHETISER...   AAAARRRRRGGGGG !!!!!         GLOOSH PLAY SYNTHETISER VERY WELL,WITH SOME
 FRIENDS HE HAS MAKE A GROUP.   WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS NOT TOO BAD.     WHEN WE'LL BE ON ARCHIMEDE,WE'LL USE THEIR MUSICS FOR SOME DEMOS...          MCODER STAY ON ST.                  STILL READING ?      DON'T WORRY,THAT SCROLL IS SHORTER THAN THE 
BIG-DEMO ONE...      YOU MUST BE TIRED,LET'S MAKE A PAUSE:                                                                              OK,WE CONTINUE.         I'AM SURE THAT,BEFORE YOU SEE THIS DEMO ,YOU DIDN'T KNOW US.    WELL,THAT'S QUITE LOGICAL
.     WE'RE NOT A VERY PROLIFIC CREW...       THE FIRST TIME YOU MIGHT HEARD ABOUT US,WAS WHEN WE HAVE SPREAD,TWO YEARS AGO,TRUCS ET ASTUCES 1 (BEURRKK !!).   BUT THIS PROGRAMM  WASN'T A DEMO,JUST A USEFULL PROGRAMM...     OUR SECOND ONE(THE
 NUMBER 2) IS MORE A DEMO THAN ANYTHING ELSE.         WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH ONLY FEW OTHER GROUP( CST(HI ANDROMEDA,STILL ALIVE ???),TCB ),AND THAT ALL.     BUT WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO KNOW THE REPLICANTS,THE EMPIRE,EQUINOX...     SO,WE ARE NOT ALONE
,AND THIS IS WHY,I THINK THAT THIS DEMO WILL BE SPREAD VERY WELL.             TODAY,IT'S THE LAST DAY OF 1989(WE ARE THE 12.31.89.) SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOME THING:     H A P P Y   N E W   Y E A R   !!             THE YEARS 1989 WAS VERY IMPORTANT
 FOR US,IT'S DURING THIS YEARS THAT WE HAVE SEE THE ARCHIMEDE FOR THE FIRST TIME,THAT WE HAVE MET MCODER,THAT I HAVE KNOWN VIRGINY ( HI VIRGINY !),THAT WE HAVE FINISH THIS DEMO,
 AND I'AM FORGOTTEN ALL THE OTHER THINGS...             THIS SCROLL IS A BIT BORING,ISN'T IT ?       DON'T WORRY,IT'S NEARLY FINISHED...      I'LL TELL YOU AT THE END HOW TO FIND THE SECOND HIDDEN-SCREEN.       I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE NOW TO 
ANDROMEDA FROM THE CONSTELLATION.      THERE'S ONE YEAR AGO,HE TOLD US THAT WE WERE LOOSY-LAMERS,LOOSER,WE COULDN'T CODE IN ASSEMBLER.     AHAHAHA   HEY! ANDROMEDA,JUST TRY TO DO ONLY THE HALF OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS DEMO !!! AHAHAH ! POOR
 FELLOW !   I'M SURE THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO TO THAT. IF YOU WANT,I CAN TEACH YOU FEW THINGS,AHAHAHA!!     I WANT TO GREET THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT CREW BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN SOME GRAPHIXS FROM THEM FOR OUR DEMO...  HI PEGASUS,HI PHOENEEX !
      THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE BEEN TO SEE A CREW WAS WHEN WE WENT TO THE STEPHEN HOUSE(AMDROMEDA !).   THERE'S ABOUT A BIT MORE THAN ONE YEAR AGO.      WHEN WE ARRIVED AT STEPHEN'S HOUSE WE WERE COMPLETLY DISTROYED,OURS LEGS COULDN'T STAND UP US
ANY MORE.        DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY ?        YES?  OK.     ANDROMEDA LIVE AT ABOUT 50KM FROM US.    HE LIVED AT THE END OF A LITTLE VILLAGE,THERE ARE A LOT OF HILLS NEAR HERE...    THE NEAREST TRAIN STATION IS AT ABOUT 16KM,AND AS WE WERE 
 ( TOMSTAR AND ME,FIFIRE ) COMING BY TRAIN,WELL WE HAVE DECIDED TO BRING WITH US OUR BIKES...      WE HAVE TOOK THE TRAIN AT 11H50 AM,THE TRAIN WAS,OF COURSE,IN LATE(THAT LOGICAL...). 
   AFTER HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS TO PUT OUR  BIKES IN THE TRAIN,THE TRAVEL STARTED.    AFTER 
ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES,WE LEFT OUR TRAIN TO TAKE AN OTHER ONE BUT AS WE WERE IN LATE(BECAUSE THE TRAIN WAS IN LATE),WE MISSED IT...     ARE YOU FOLLOWING WHAT I'M SAYING ??     WELL,OK         SO,WE HAD TO WAIT THIRTY MINUTES MORE TO TAKE
 THE NEXT TRAIN.       AFTER HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS TO PUT OUR BIKES IN THE TRAIN (LIKE IN THE FIRST ONE...),THE TRAVEL CONTINUED...... AND HALF AN HOUR LATER(THIS TRAVEL WAS AS BORING AS THIS SCROLLTEXT !) WE ARRIVED TO THE TRAIN STATION.    AFTER
 HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS TO PUT OUT OUR BIKES FROM THE TRAIN (ARGGG !! BLOODY TRAINS !!) WE RODE OUR BIKES AND STARTED TO PEDAL.     THE BEGINING WAS EASY,THE ROAD WAS AS FLAT AS A RAINBIRD'S ADVENTURE GAME...    WE WERE GOING QUITE FAST.   10 KILOM
ETERS LATER ,WE WERE GOING LIKE SNAILS,WE HAD JUST ENCOUNTERED THE FIRST HILLS...     WHEN WE ARRIVED AT ANDROMEDA'S HOUSE,WE WERE COMPETLY WEAK.    OUR LEGS COULDN'T SUPPORT US ANYMORE.        WHEN WE LEFT HIM,IT WAS ABOUT 6 PM.  WE RODE OUR BIKES
 AGAIN.     THE SUN WAS STARTING TO FALL.  10 MINUTES LATER WE WERE IN THE DARK AND THERE WAS SOME SMOG ON THE ROAD TOO...    OOPS,I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SAY THAT WE HAD NO LIGHTS ON OUR BIKES...     THAT FUNNY ISN'T IT ?        WE WERE QUITE AFRAID...
  WE HAD REACH THE TRAIN STATION IN A BIT MORE THAN ONE HOUR.    BUT THAT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE THE TRAIN. WHEN WE ARRIVED,THE TRAIN WAS JUST LEAVING THE STATION.          WE HAVE HAD TO WAIT ABOUT ONE HOUR TO TAKE AN OTHER TRAIN( COZ WE WERE ON SUND
AY AND ON SUNDAY,THERE'S LESS TRAIN...).       WE ARRIVED AT HOME AT ABOUT 9.30 PM.      SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A TRAVEL LIKE THAT ?     THAT IT'S GOOD FOR OUR HEALF ?                WELL,NOW I WANNA TELL YA A GOOD NEW...      THIS IS THE END OF
 THAT SCROLLTEXT !!!!!        YOU ARE HAPPY,ISN'T IT?   WELL,LESS HAPPY THAN ME,THAT'S SURE...     SO, IT'S TIME FOR US TO TELL YOU 'BYE BYE' AND WE DON'T TELL YOU 'SEE YOU SOON' BECAUSE ,AS WE ALREADY TOLD YOU,THIS IS THE FIRST AND THE LAST DEMO 
FROM THE STARFIRES,ON ST...........     BYE BYE AND THANX: TO ALL OUR FRIENDS,ALL THE CREWS ON ST,AND OF COURSE TO YOU.              BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK US(ABOUT ONE OF OUR DEMOS) , IF YOU NEED SOME HELP OR IF YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR
