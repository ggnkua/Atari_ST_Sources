                 ALORS VOILA,C'EST FAIT,NOUS L'AVONS ENFIN FINI !!! CA A ETE DUR MAIS ON Y EST ARRIVE. BON,ASSEZ PARLE FRANCAIS AND LET'S TALK IN ENGLISH (OR WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE...) !!!    SO,AS I SAID BEFORE, IT WAS HARD BUT WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THIS USEFUL DEMO(THE FIRST ON ST !!!) OF WHAT,WE,THE STARFIRES(OR TST,AS YOU LIKE) , CAN DO ON THAT BLOODY ATARI ST. OF COURSE THIS IS LESS, HOW CAN I SAY THAT...  OH YES!   IT'S LESS DESTROY THAN THE CAREBEARS DEMOS (LET'S REMEMBER THEIR CUDDLY DEMOS, EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY ON -VERY- OLD SHIFTERS (ET PAN!,DANS LES DENTS !!!) BUT I THINK THAT THE FEW DEMOS WHICH ARE ON THIS DISK ARE AS GOOD AS THEIRS.... AND PERHAPS BETTER (IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR US!).      WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL ENJOY THESE DEMOS !!!         BUT NOW,LET'S TALK ABOUT 'TRUCS ET ASTUCES 2' ITSELF.........        THERE IS A LONG TIME THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM,OUR LAST ONE(FOR GLOOSH AND ME,FIFIRE,WE'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER...) THIS DEMO IS,IN FACT,COMPOSED OF TWO PARTS....  THE FIRST ONE IS TA2 ITSELF AND THE SECOND IS ALL THE DEMO PROGRAMS.     TA2 (TRUCS ET ASTUCES 2) IS VERY EASY TO USE...  YOU JUST HAVE TO DO LIKE IN THE GEMDOS. FOR THE DEMO-SCREENS, JUST LOAD THEM BY PRESSING THE RIGHT NUMBER IN THE MAIN MENU. IF YOU WANT TO EXIT A DEMO SCREEN,JUST PRESS THE RESET BUTTON.   TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS.  FIRST IT WAS THE TIME (MAKING A PROGRAM NEEDS A LOT OF TIME) WE CAN'T COUNT ALL THE NIGHTS LOST ON IT (WHEN YOU GO TO BED AT 2 AM AND YOU HAVE TO GET UP AT 6 AM TO GO TO SCHOOL...    YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOME OF THEM FEEL ASLEEP DURING MATHEMATICS LESSON OR PHILOSOPHICAL'S ONES...) , THE SECOND PROBLEM WAS , AS ALWAYS , THE SCHOOL (FUCK...FUCK...FUCK !!!) , IN FRANCE WE WORK AT SCHOOL ABOUT 8 HOURS PER DAYS (FIFIRE (ME) HAS 2 HOURS MORE FOR THE TRAVEL (BY TRAIN)) .  WE AREN'T LIKE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH WORK ONLY 4 OR 5 HOURS PER DAYS (BANDES DE FUMISTES !!!!!)... AND SOME OF THEN HAVE HAD AN EXAM AT THE END OF THE YEAR (AS TOMSTAR AND FIFIRE).      THIS YEAR,IT'S THE SAME THING...       THE LAST PROBLEM WAS THAT WE WEREN'T VERY GOOD CODERS.      BUT ONE DAY,AS WE WERE DESESPERATED,THE REINCARNATION OF GOD APPEARED IN FRONT OF US... IT WAS THE GREAT,THE FAMOUS,THE MARVELLOUS,THE MEGAMIGHTY :  MCODER       WHEN HE SAW US HE SAID:' CASSEZ VOUS BANDES DE NAZES ET LAISSEZ MOI FAIRE !!' (HE IS A VERY POETIC GUY...)  AND WITH HIS HELP WE HAVE STARTED TO MAKE LOVELY DEMOS.............    IN THIS DISK THERE IS MORE THAN 200 STUFFS FOR GAMES AND BETWEEN 300 OR 400 KO OF TEXTS (THEY WERE ALL WRITTEN BY FIFIRE, THE LOOSY MAIN MENU WAS DONE BY FIFIRE , THE GRAPHIXXS BY GLOOSH AND FIFIRE AND THE DEMOS BY MCODER AND FIFIRE...      WE THANX THE OTHER MEMBERS (ARE THEY MEMBERS ???) , TOMSTAR AND RICUS FOR THEIR IMPORTANT MORAL SUPPORT (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,I'M LAUGHING,HAHAHAHAHA !!!!!).  WE HAVE MADE THIS PROGRAM WITH THE HELP OF THE   S.P.Y.J.A.C.K. CIE   ,WE REALLY WANT TO THANX THEM (HELLO SPY3 AND MAXI !!!) FOR THEIR PRECIOUS HELP (MOSTLY FOR THE SIERRA ON LINE'S GAMES ANSWERS).  THERE IS ONE YEAR THAT THEY'RE WAITING THE END OF THIS PROGRAM , I HOPE THEY WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED...     WE ALSO WANT TO GREET (LET'S GO FOR THE TRADITIONNAL GREETINGS !) :  TOUBAB  FOR IS GOOD WORK ON ST (KEEP ON BOY !) , GILLUS(OR GL) YOU ARE A GOOD FELLOW (C'EST BIEN MAIS TU PEUX ENCORE FAIRE MIEUX...) , ARIOCH (WELL,NOT SO BAD,EXCEPT YOUR DEMOS...) , L'AVENFOU (YOU HAVE DONE SOME GOOD THINGS) AND ALL THE GUYS I FORGOT AND WHO MAKE THIS SORT OF THINGS ON ST (AND ON AMIGA TOO).    NOW WE 'RE GOING TO GREET ALL OUR FRIENDS ON ST, I WANNA START WITH THE SPYJACK-CIE (THANX FOR YOUR HELP) , THE GOLD NINJA (OR ST-AT OR 125YZ...) I WANT THE GREET THE SON FIRST(HELLO ERIC)TO HAVE GIVEN TO ME SO MUCH GAMES AND NOW I WANNA GREET THE FATHER (HELLO !!!!   THANX TO HAVE DRIVEN ERIC AT HOME....) , IONIX (HELLO BOY!!! ARE YOU OK?

SO THAT'S ALL FOR THE GREETINGS.                       NOW IT'S TIME FOR PERSONNAL MESSAGES.         I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY SOME GROUP PUT FUCK-GREETINGS INTO THEIR SCROLL ???       IT'S STUPID !!   OF COURSE,SOME PEOPLE NEED TO BE 'FUCK' SOMETIMES,BUT NOT TOO MUCH...    PERHAPS THEY ARE STUPID (MORE STUPID THAN YOU ?) , PERHAPS THEY ARE ROBBERS,LAMERS,LOOSERS,BUT IT'S NOT A REASON TO FUCK THEM ALL THE TIME(THEY MUST BE COMPLETELY WEAK AT THE END...).         NOW WE HAVE A MESSAGE TO SEND TO    THE A.P.P. (ORGANISATION AGAINST CRACKER GROUPS).      IT'S A SAD JOB YOU MAKE,BOYS!!!     TO ARREST TEENAGERS,PUT THEM IN JAIL OR ASK THEM MONEY...    WELL,THAT'S SAD AND USELESS,IT'S A BAD JOB YOU DO.    THE WORTH IS THAT IT'S COMPLETELY USELESS.    IF YOU'D REALLY WANNA ARREST ALL CRACKED GAMES USERS,YOU'D HAVE TO ARREST ALL THE ST USERS !!                  NOW I GIVE THE KEYBOARD TO GLOOSH                 NOW,IT'S THE TURN TO MCODER          AND I GONNA GIVE THE KEYBOARD TO ZOGG, HE ISN'T A MEMBER OF TST BUT AS HE IS A GOOD FRIEND... WELL...

OK,I TRANSLATE IT:   ZOGG IS LOOKING FOR A JOB OF GRAPHIXS MAKERS IN A CREW. IT'S HIM WHO HAD MADE THE LOVELY STARSHIP (THE SHIP WITH A TOILET SHAPE !!) WHICH CROSS THE SCREEN SOMETIMES.   HE IS A QUITE GOOD GRAPHIST,SO IF YA'RE INTERESTED,CONTACT US.          WE HAVE A LOT OF PROJECTS FOR THE FUTURE... BUT NOT ON ST.             WE HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ATARI ST TO GO ON ARCHIMEDE.           WELL,I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT...     NO ! WE AREN'T CRAZY!! THERE'S A LONG TIME AGO THAT WE WANNA GO ON THIS MACHINE.        OK THERE ARE LESS PROGRAMS ON IT THAN ON ST OR ON AMIGA BUT WHEN WE HAVE USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME,GLOOSH AND ME,WERE VERY SURPRISED BY THE POWER OF THIS COMPUTER.  IN TWO HOURS WE HAVE CODED A SCROLLER WHICH SCROLLED A PICTURE IN 640-256 IN 256 COLORS,WITH A SPRITE 256*100 IN 256 COLORS...     WELL,WE HAVE DONE IT IN...   BASIC (WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF ASSEMBLER.) !!       THE SCROLLER WAS AN HORIZONTAL ONE.      THE SOUNDSHIP OF THIS COMPUTER IS BETTER THAN THE STE ONE(AN THE AMIGA ONE...).  YOU CAN MAKE MUSIC IN 8 VOICES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM(AND TO DO WHAT YOU WANT DURING THIS TIME...  COZ THE HARDWARE.) .   THIS COMPUTER SPEED IS: 4MIPS-8MIPS        NOT SO BAD ISN'T IT...    SO WE HAVE DECIDED GLOOSH AND ME TO GO ON THIS 'MACHINE' (MCODER STAYS ON ST.).     NOW WE ARE GOING TO GREET SOME GUYS ON ARCHI:    HI TO MOURNBLADE , ARCHIMAN , AGORA , CUTHAGA , RATBOY (HELLO !) , ACORN , CRAZY-WIMP , AND ALL I FORGOT...              BUT LET'S COME BACK ON THAT BLOODY ST(BEURK !)...           WELL,WE HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING(LIKE OMEGA...)       THERE IS NO CREW ON ST WHO MAKES GOOD GRAPHIXS,I MEAN VERY GOOD PICTURES.          FOR THE MUSICS WE HAVE MAD-MAX(HI !) , DAVE WHITTAKER, ROB HUBBARD.             FOR PROGRAMS WE HAVE THE TCB (AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE UNION) AND OF COURSE US (THE STARFIRES... YEEAAAAH !!)        BUT FOR THE GRAPHIX,IT'S NOT THE CASE ...    THERE IS NOBODY !        THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM , TO UNDERSTAND THAT , JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE TCB'S DEMOS ...         THEY'RE TECHNICALLY PERFECT (WELL   NOT SO PERFECT... THEY COULD DO 'MUCHO' BETTER !) , BUT THE PICTURES ARE VERY POOR...  THIS ALWAYS THE SAME LETTERS , ETC...        SO,WE SEND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE :    ' IF YA'RE A GOOD GRAPHIST,DON'T BE AFRAID TO CONTACT A CREW !!   THEY NEVER ATE ANYBODY(IN GENERAL...). '     I THINK THE OTHER CREWS WILL AGREE WITH WHAT I'M SAYING , ISN'T IT ??                WELL,ARE YOU ALWAYS HERE ?       NOT ASLEEP YET ?      DO YOU LIKE THIS SCREEN(CALLED STAR'S DEMO)? PERHAPS A BIT BORING,ISN'T IT ?     IF YOU ARE INTERESTING IN CONTACT US,I'LL TELL YA HOW TO DO LATER(AT THE END OF THIS SCROLLTEXT... DON'T WORRY,IT'S NEARLY FINISHED !)      IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS ALREADY,WE ARE NOT CRACKERS,JUST CODERS OR LAMERS(ISN'T IT TOMSTAR,RICUS ???),WE ARE TOGETHER LIVING IN THE SAME TOWN(EXEPT MCODER WHO LIVE 5KM FROM OUR TOWN),IT'S A LOVELY TOWN  WITH ITS LITTLE HOUSES,ITS BUILDINGS AND ITS GHETTOS...             WE LIVED AT 35KM FROM PARIS('HAAAA PPAAARRRRISSSS,ITS EFFEL-TOWER,ITS 'CHAMPS ELYSEES',ITS PRETTY GIRLS....' YOU KNOW,GIRLS'NEIGHBOURS ARE ALWAYS BETTER THAN OURS...  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN ?  NO ? DON'T WORRY,IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT,MAYBE IT'S TOO PHILOSOPHICAL FOR YOU...)     WE ARE ALL BETWEEN 16 AND 24 YEARS OLD.      WE DON'T EAT FROG(ONLY FOR BREAKFAST...),SNAIL(JUST FOR THE BREAK,AT 5 PM...) WE DON'T DRINK COKE BUT WINE(HAHAHA !!),AND WE ARE ALWAYS WEARING A BERET ON OUR HEADS, CARRING A PIECE OF BREAD IN THE LEFT HAND AND A BOTTLE OF WINE IN THE RIGHT ONE..... AHAHAHAHAHA  I WAS JOKING !!!   THAT'S STUPID YOU'RE THINKING ?  WELL I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY,SO...                BUT NOW,LET'S SPEAK ABOUT THE 'NEW' ATARI ST .... I MEAN THE ATARI STE.         WELL,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT ??   HAVE YOU ALREADY SAW ONE ?   WELL,IF YOU DON'T,I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.             SO,LET'S GO         WELL,YOU SEE THE COMPUTER IN WHICH YOU HAVE LOADED THIS DEMO ?  WELL,THE NEW ATARI STE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME 'LOOK'.   WHEN I SAY EXACTLY,I SAY THAT IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME,THE ONLY THINGS WHICH CHANGE ARE THE TWO OTHER JOYSTICK PLUNGS AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THIS COMPUTER...    THAT'S ALL !       OOPS,I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT INSTEAD OF PRINT ATARI 520STF THERE IS    ATARI 520STE .  IT'S COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLD ATARI STF.         WELL,IN FACT IT'S NOT SO COMPATIBLE...   A LOT OF GAMES DON'T WORK PROPELY ON IT(ABOUT 40 PERCENT !) AND MOST OF THE DEMOS BUG ON IT...     THIS ONE TOO (I HAVEN'T TRY...).     THE SOUNDCHIP IS BETTER THAN THE 'STF' ONE (BUT IT'S WORST THAN THE AMIGA ONE,AND OF COURSE WORST THAN THE ARCHIMEDE ONE !).     THE GRAPHIX ARE THE SAME EXCEPT THAT YOU HAVE 4096 COLORS INSTEAD OF 512 (BUT ALWAYS 16 COLORS IN LOW RESOLUTION...).       THERE IS A BLITTER IN IT AND SOME HARDWARE SCROLLERS (LIKE THE AMIGA BUT 4 YEARS LATER !).           THE R.O.M. OF THAT NEW COMPUTER IS COMPLETELY BUGGED,FOR EXEMPLE,YOU CAN'T BOOT WITH A DESKTOP.INF WHICH PUT THE ST IN MEDIUM RESOLUTION (IT'S STILL IN LOW),THERE IS SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE DISK ACCESSES,ETC.       IN FACT THIS COMPUTER IS STILL UNDER THE AMIGA (FOR THE GRAPHISM,THE MUSIC...)     I HOPE THAT THE T.T.  (THE TRANSPUTOR FROM ATARI)  WILL BE BETTER...      I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE STE IS A BIG SHIT (...),I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT'S JUST LIKE THE OLD ST AND THAT IT GIVE US NOTHING MORE.........             ALWAYS READING THAT SCROLL ????         ARE YOU COURAGEOUS OR      STUPID...                   IN THE MAIN MENU OF THIS DISK (BEURK !) YOU CAN CHOOSE THE SCREEN YOU WANT TO SEE BETWEEN 7.             WELL,IN FACT THERE ARE 9 DIFFERENT DEMOS....      YYYEEEEEAAAAAA !!!!!  YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD,THERE IS 2 HIDDEN SCREENS !!!     BUT DON'T WORRY,THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT.      IN THE FIRST ONE I GREET THE SPYJACK-CIE (HAVE YOU TRIED ALL THE NUMBERS... 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ???)        AND IN THE SECOND ONE...      WELL        I GIVE MY ADRESS,AND SAY FEW INTERESTING THINGS...       GOOD LUCK TO FIND IT !!                  BUT NOW,LET'S CHANGE  OF SUBJECT.     HAVE YOU ALREADY SEEN 'THE GENIUS HAS NO BORDER DEMO'      WELL,WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ?     SURPRISING,ISN'T IT ?    AND IT WORKS ON ALL SHIFTERS.      DO YOU THINK SOMEONE WILL BEAT IT A DAY ?      WELL,ACCORDING TO ME,THAT'S NOT SURE,NOT SURE AT ALL.       HEY,THE CAREBEARS !!  TRY TO BEAT OUR FULLSCREEN DEMO !!!   AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA       OUR FULLSCREENDEMO WAS DONE BY MCODER AND FIFIRE.           AND HAVE YOU SEEN THE BOUNCINGBALLS-DEMO ?????       IT'S THE DEMO WHICH MOVES THE MOST OF SPRITE ON ST (131 SPRITES IN 16.16,IN 2 BITPLANES..).         SOME OF THE DEMOS WHICH ARE ON THIS DISK ARE GOOD,THE OTHER ARE QUITE LOOSY (AS THE BIG-ONE DEMO,3D-GROUND DEMO),IF THEY'RE BAD IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE OLD.                STILL READING ???        DO YOU THINK THIS SCROLLING IS A BIT TO FAST ??        NOT EASY TO READ ISN'T IT ?       YEEAAAA,I UNDERSTAND,IT'S THE DISTORTION WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO READ (ARRGGGG,MY ENGLISH IS VERY BAD,ISN'T IT. I HAVE A BIG COMPLEX WITH ENGLISH...)                 NOW I'AM GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY,IT'S A QUITE FUNNY STORY AS YOU'LL SEE.          THERE IS A FEW TIME AGO , A PERSONAL COMPUTER SHOW HAVE BEEN ORGANISED IN FRANCE,IT WAS IN OCTOBER .    ANYWAY,WE HAVE DECIDED TO GO HERE ,TO HAVE A LOOK...     WHEN I SAY  'WE',I MEAN  GLOOSH AND ME.       SO,WE HAVE TOOK THE TRAIN AND AFTER HALF AN HOUR , WE ARRIVED IN PARIS.    OF COURSE WE LOST OURSELF IN THE SUBWAY (THAT'S LOGICAL...).   WE WERE WAITING DURING ONE HOUR BEFORE ENTERING THE COMPUTER SHOW.        WE WERE ALREADY WALKING IN THE SHOW SINCE 1 HOUR WHEN GLOOSH CALLED ME AND SHOW ME A DEMO MADE BY A CREW THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAME (HEMMM).   SO,I LOOK AT THE DEMO AND SAID TO GLOOSH  ' HAHAHA THAT A LOOSY DEMO !!!,LOOK AT THE SCROLLER AHAHAH !!!',AND GLOOSH REPLIED  'YES, AHAHA, AND LOOK AT THE COLORS,THEY'RE HORRIBLE,HAHAHA'   WE WERE SO BUSY TO LAUGH THAT WE HADN'T NOTICED THE MAN WHO WAS JUST BEHIND US...    'AND LISTEN TO THAT LOOSY DIGIT MUSAK,IT MUST BE A DIGIT IN 7.5KHZ HAHAH'    AT THIS MOMENT,THE MAN WHO WAS BEHIND US START TO SPEAK AND TOLD US  'HELLO,HOW DO YOU FIND THE DEMO I HAVE CODED ??'       I REALLY LOOKED ANGRY (WHY ? I DON'T SEE WHY ...).        GLOOSH AND ME WERE VERY SURPRISED,BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T NOTICED THEMAN BEFORE...    IT WAS SURE THAT HE HAD HEARD ALL WE HAVE SAID...    'WELL,HEMM,IT'S ,HEM,HOW CAN I SAY THAT... WELL,IT'S A QUITE NICE ONE...   HEM,WELL    BYE BYE SIR,SEE YOU SOON ! '  GLOOSH REPLIED,AND WE LEFT THE MAN...  HE WAS VERY ANGRY.    THERE WERE PRETTY GIRLS TOO , IN THAT COMPUTER SHOW (HELLO NATHALIE !!)...            EXCEPT GIRLS,THIS COMPUTER SHOW WAS NOT VERY GOOD,IT WAS TOO SMALL.                BUT DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE ONLY INTERESTED BY COMPUTERS AND GIRLS (WELL,NOT ONLY...).       WE ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN MUSIC.        EACH OF US LIKE A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC THAN THE OTHER.     DO YOU WANT AN EXEMPLE ?      OK,GLOOSH LIKE DEPECHE-MODE,MCODER ART OF NOISE,FIFIRE BACH,VIVALDI,MOZART AND DEPECHE-MODE TOO(NOBODY'S PERFECT !), THE ONLY ONE WHO HAVE A STRANGE TOAST IS RICUS...  HE LOVES RAPP AND HOUSE MUSIC.      I REMEMBER SOME COPY PARTY AT RICUS HOME,IN WHICH,DURING 5 HOURS YOU HAD TO SUPPORT THOSE SORT OF NOISE (OOPS,I MEAN MUZAK !).....  BEURKKK      WHEN YOU ESCAPED FROM THAT HELL,YOU THOUGHT THAT YOUR HEAD WAS GOING TO BLAST !!!  THAT WAS HORRIBLE.      BUT THE MOST HORRIBLE WAS WHEN RICUS STARTED TO SHOW US THE NEW MUSIC HE MADE ON HIS SYNTHETISER...   AAAARRRRRGGGGG !!!!!         GLOOSH PLAY SYNTHETISER VERY WELL,WITH SOME FRIENDS HE HAS MADE A GROUP.   WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS NOT TOO BAD.     WHEN WE'LL BE ON ARCHIMEDE,WE'LL USE THEIR MUSICS FOR SOME DEMOS...          MCODER STAY ON ST.                  STILL READING ?      DON'T WORRY,THAT SCROLL IS SHORTER THAN THE BIG-DEMO ONE...      YOU MUST BE TIRED,LET'S MAKE A PAUSE:                                                                              OK,WE CONTINUE.         I'AM SURE THAT,BEFORE YOU SEE THIS DEMO ,YOU DIDN'T KNOW US.    WELL,THAT'S QUITE LOGICAL.     WE'RE NOT A VERY PROLIFIC CREW...       THE FIRST TIME YOU MIGHT HEARD ABOUT US,WAS WHEN WE HAVE SPREAD,TWO YEARS AGO,TRUCS ET ASTUCES 1 (BEURRKK !!).   BUT THIS PROGRAM  WASN'T A DEMO,JUST A USEFUL PROGRAM...     OUR SECOND ONE(THE NUMBER 2) IS MORE A DEMO THAN ANYTHING ELSE.         WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH ONLY FEW OTHER GROUPS(CST(HI ANDROMEDA,STILL ALIVE ???),TCB),AND THAT'S ALL.     BUT WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO KNOW THE REPLICANTS,THE EMPIRE,EQUINOX...     SO,WE ARE NOT ALONE,AND THIS IS WHY,I THINK THAT THIS DEMO WILL BE SPREADED VERY WELL.             TODAY,IT'S THE LAST DAY OF 1989(WE ARE THE 12.31.89.) SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOME THING:     H A P P Y   N E W   Y E A R   !!             THE YEARS 1989 WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US,IT'S DURING THESE YEARS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE ARCHIMEDE FOR THE FIRST TIME,THAT WE HAVE MET MCODER,THAT I HAVE KNOWN VIRGINY (HI VIRGINY !),THAT WE HAVE FINISHED THIS DEMO, AND I'VE FORGOTTEN ALL THE OTHER THINGS...             THIS SCROLL IS A BIT BORING,ISN'T IT ?       DON'T WORRY,IT'S NEARLY FINISHED...      I'LL TELL YOU AT THE END HOW TO FIND THE SECOND HIDDEN-SCREEN.       I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE NOW TO ANDROMEDA FROM THE CONSTELLATION.      THERE'S ONE YEAR AGO,HE TOLD US THAT WE WERE LOOSY-LAMERS,LOOSER,WE COULDN'T CODE IN ASSEMBLER.     AHAHAHA   HEY! ANDROMEDA,JUST TRY TO DO ONLY THE HALF OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS DEMO !!! AHAHAH ! POOR FELLOW !   I'M SURE THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO THAT. IF YOU WANT,I CAN TEACH YOU FEW THINGS,AHAHAHA!!     I WANT TO GREET THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT CREW BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN SOME GRAPHIXS FROM THEM FOR OUR DEMO...  HI PEGASUS,HI PHOENEEX !      THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE BEEN TO SEE A CREW WAS WHEN WE WENT TO THE STEPHEN HOUSE(AMDROMEDA !).   THERE'S ABOUT A BIT MORE THAN ONE YEAR AGO.      WHEN WE ARRIVED AT STEPHEN'S HOUSE WE WERE COMPLETELY DESTROYED,OURS LEGS COULDN'T STAND UP USANY MORE.        DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY ?        YES?  OK.     ANDROMEDA LIVE AT ABOUT 50KM FROM US.    HE LIVED AT THE END OF A LITTLE VILLAGE,THERE ARE A LOT OF HILLS NEAR HERE...    THE NEAREST TRAIN STATION IS AT ABOUT 16KM,AND AS WE WERE  (TOMSTAR AND ME,FIFIRE) COMING BY TRAIN,WELL WE HAVE DECIDED TO BRING WITH US OUR BIKES...      WE HAVE TOOK THE TRAIN AT 11H50 AM,THE TRAIN WAS,OF COURSE,IN LATE(THAT'S LOGICAL...).    AFTER WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS TO PUT OUR  BIKES IN THE TRAIN,THE TRAVEL STARTED.    AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES,WE LEFT OUR TRAIN TO TAKE AN OTHER ONE BUT AS WE WERE IN LATE(BECAUSE THE TRAIN WAS IN LATE),WE MISSED IT...     ARE YOU FOLLOWING WHAT I'M SAYING ??     WELL,OK         SO,WE HAD TO WAIT THIRTY MINUTES MORE TO TAKE THE NEXT TRAIN.       AFTER HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS TO PUT OUR BIKES IN THE TRAIN (LIKE IN THE FIRST ONE...),THE TRAVEL CONTINUED...... AND HALF AN HOUR LATER(THIS TRAVEL WAS AS BORING AS THIS SCROLLTEXT !) WE ARRIVED TO THE TRAIN STATION.    AFTER HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS TO PUT OUT OUR BIKES FROM THE TRAIN (ARGGG !! BLOODY TRAINS !!) WE RODE OUR BIKES AND STARTED TO PEDAL.     THE BEGINNING WAS EASY,THE ROAD WAS AS FLAT AS A RAINBIRD'S ADVENTURE GAME...    WE WERE GOING QUITE FAST.   10 KILOMETERS LATER ,WE WERE GOING LIKE SNAILS,WE HAD JUST ENCOUNTERED THE FIRST HILLS...     WHEN WE ARRIVED AT ANDROMEDA'S HOUSE,WE WERE COMPETELY WEAK.    OUR LEGS COULDN'T SUPPORT US ANYMORE.        WHEN WE LEFT HIM,IT WAS ABOUT 6 PM.  WE RODE OUR BIKES AGAIN.     THE SUN WAS STARTING TO FALL.  10 MINUTES LATER WE WERE IN THE DARK AND THERE WAS SOME SMOG ON THE ROAD TOO...    OOPS,I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SAY THAT WE HAD NO LIGHTS ON OUR BIKES...     THAT FUNNY ISN'T IT ?        WE WERE QUITE AFRAID...  WE HAD REACH THE TRAIN STATION IN A BIT MORE THAN ONE HOUR.    BUT THAT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE THE TRAIN. WHEN WE ARRIVED,THE TRAIN WAS JUST LEAVING THE STATION.          WE HAVE HAD TO WAIT ABOUT ONE HOUR TO TAKE ANOTHER TRAIN(COZ WE WERE ON SUNDAY AND ON SUNDAY,THERE'S LESS TRAIN...).       WE ARRIVED AT HOME AT ABOUT 9.30 PM.      SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A TRAVEL LIKE THAT ?     THAT IT'S GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH ?                WELL,NOW I WANNA TELL YA A GOOD NEW...      THIS IS THE END OF THAT SCROLLTEXT !!!!!        YOU ARE HAPPY,ISN'T IT?   WELL,LESS HAPPY THAN ME,THAT'S SURE...     SO, IT'S TIME FOR US TO TELL YOU 'BYE BYE' AND WE DON'T TELL YOU 'SEE YOU SOON' BECAUSE ,AS WE ALREADY TOLD YOU,THIS IS THE FIRST AND THE LAST DEMO FROM THE STARFIRES,ON ST...........     BYE BYE AND THANX: TO ALL OUR FRIENDS,ALL THE CREWS ON ST,AND OF COURSE TO YOU.              BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK US(ABOUT ONE OF OUR DEMOS) , IF YOU NEED SOME HELP OR IF YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR YOUNG(OR OLD) SISTER TO US...     WELL,CONTACT US !
