           THE STARFIRES STRIKE AGAIN WITH A NEW BRAIN-BLASTING-WORLD-RECORD-DEMO :
      THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF 32X32 SPRITES IN 8 COLOURS !!!
      (TRY TO BEAT DIS, TCB, AH AH AH !!!)
    WE ACTUALLY DISPLAY 22 SPRITES IN EACH VBL AND THEY ARE NOT TRACKING !!!
   THIS SCREEN WAS CODED BY MCODER, THE GRAPHIXX WERE RIPPED FROM THE AMIGA
 SCOOPEX INTRO AND THE MUZAK DONE BY MAD MAX.
        IT'S MCODER ON THE KEYBOARD. DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH THE AMORPHS ???
             REALLY ????
             SO YOU SHOULD PRESS F1 TO F8 (I LET YOU DISCOVER THEIR FUNCTION).
     THE DATE OF THE RELEASE IS THE FIRST OF MARCH 1990, BUT THIS DEMO IS
 ALREADY SOME MONTHS OLDER, AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO FINISH IT BEFORE...
             LET ME INTRODUCE YOU THE GREETINGS :
             MEGA-GREETINGS TO THE CAREBEARS (EVERYBODY LOVES YOUR DEMOS, 
WE STRONGLY HOPE YOU WON'T STOP. NICK, DO YOU LIKE YOUR JOB NOW ?
  I'M VERY IMPRESSED BY YOUR HARDWARE-SCROLLER, 
BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR GAMES USE SO LITTLE SPRITES -PERHAPS 
YOU SHOULD GIVE UP THE IDEA OF MAKING SYNCHRO GAMES-. 
HEY NICK, I'M NOT ONLY THE BEST OPTIMIZER IN FRANCE BUT ALSO IN THE WHOLE WORLD !!! 
AN-COOL, YOU MUST PERPETUATE THE NAME OF 'TCB', AND YOUR LAST DEMOS 
ARE VERY GOOD, PLEASANT AND YOU ARE A FUTURE GOOD MUSICIAN).
             GREETINGS TO ZUUL (ESPECIALLY TGN, I'LL WORK FOR YOU IN THE NEAR FUTURE),
             THE REPLICANTS (YOU ARE THE BEST CRACKERS ON ST AND I CAN'T STAND THAT SOMETIMES 
YOU SPREAD GAMES BADLY CRACKED, KEEP UP THE QUALITY !!!),
             ST-CONNEXION (WOW, YOU ARE A GOOD GROUP, GREAT GRAPHIST AND GOOD CODERS, 
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO COUNT CYCLES AND YOUR SOUNDTRACKER WON'T 
REACH 31 KHZ),
             THE UNION (WHAT HAPPENS THEN ? ARE YOU WORKING NOW ??? )
             AND THAT'S ALL FOR THE GREETINGS.
                 I FEEL ANGRY AND I'M DISAPPOINTED. THE REASON OF THAT ? 
IT'S THE FACT THAT NO FRENCH CREW (EXCEPT ST-CONNEXION -I'M 
WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR YOUR DEMO...-) CAN COMPETE IN DEMOS WITH STRANGER GROUPS. 
WHY ? WE HAVE SOME GOOD GRAPHISTS AND SOME -VERY FEW- GOOD CODERS, 
PERHAPS WE PREFER LOOK AT THE DEMOS RATHER THAN MAKE THEM. 
THIS LITTLE SPEECH ALLOWS ME TO INTRODUCE YOU THE BIGGEST PART OF THE SCROLL : 
THE FUCKING LIST.
             MANY FUCKS TO :
             V8 (YOU ARE LOUSY LAMERS, BOYS, SHUT UP AND TRY TO IMPROVE YOUR WORK),
             OMEGA (STOP FUCKING TCB, YOU'RE NOT THE BEST BUT YOUR DISTER IN NYD2 
IS GREAT -THE MADMAX MUSIC ESPECIALLY-),
             THE OVERLANDERS (SHITTY DELIRIOUS DEMOS EXCEPT ZIGGY STARDUST SCREENS, 
STOP SPREADING DEMO SOURCES FROM OTHER GROUPS AND STOP USING RIPPED ROUTINES),
             EQUINOX (STOP CRACKING SO FAST AND SO BAD, AND THEN I'LL CHANGE MY MIND),
             THE CONSTELLATIONS (YOUR GRAPHIST IS VERY GOOD BUT YOUR DEMOS ARE ALWAYS 
THE SAME -DO YOU HAVE A DEMO GENERATOR ?- I BET THAT THE DEMO 
SUPPLIED WITH THE STE WAS DONE BY YOU -WHAT DID I WIN ?-).

               AH, I FEEL BETTER, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO THAT I WANTED TO SEND ALL THESE FUCKS. 
I HOPE THE NAMED GROUPS WILL READ THIS SCROLL AND RETAIN THE LESSON.         

NOW, LET'S SPEAK ABOUT TECHNIQUE (MY FAVOURITE DOMAIN). 
I THINK I HAVE THE BEST SPRITE ROUTINES -FASTER THAN OMEGA OR TCB- 
AND I SURELY WILL MAKE SOME MORE DEMOS WITH THESE VERY POWERFUL ROUTINES. 
I ALSO HAVE THE BEST PACKER. IT'S STRANGELY NAMED M-PACKER, IT'S MUCH MORE COMPACT 
(EXCEPT FOR SHORT FILES) THAN ALL AMIGA PACKERS AND AUTOMATION PACKERS !!!

                    NOW, I'M WORKING IN A SOFTWARE-HOUSE IN FRANCE AND I HOPE I WILL CODE 
GAMES YOU'LL APPRECIATE OR NOTICE, SO LOOK AT THE PREVIEWS IN GEN4. 
  END OF SCROLL                 NOW, LET'S WRAP.....
