To generate the bdos modules -

{c}a10 rwa		; assemble the assembler module
{c}bdosc @allc		; compile all the C modules


NOTE -- has the code used to clear the bss for program load been speeded up?



History of Changes made to GEMDOS V1.1.
---------------------------------------

05 Jun 87  ACH	PROC.C		Problem - After physical disk error COMMAND.PRG
				gives "Command not found." message for all
				subsequent external commands.

				Fix - Changed the error handling code in 
				xexec() to always do an ixterm(t); on any disk
				error, thus freeing memory.

26 Jun 87  ACH	TIME.C & BIOS	To enable GEMDOS to take advantage of real-time
				clock/calendars a new BIOS function (11h)
				has been added. Whenever the BDOS sets a new
				time or date this function is called and, if
				the hardware supports it, the real-time clock
				can be updated. When the BDOS needs the current
				time or date the function is called to allow 
				the BIOS to update the internal BDOS values.
				If there is no hardware clock the BIOS can 
				simply ignore this call as the BDOS still
				maintains the time and date internally based
				on the system tick.

16 Sep 87  ACH	SUP.C		Problem - the internal date and time variables
				used to time stamp file updates are set to 0
				when the OS starts up.

				Fix - Changed cinit() in SUP.C to call new BIOS
				date_time() function (11h) so that the BIOS can
				initialise the internal variables from a 
				hardware real-time clock, if supported.

9 Oct 87 ACH	BDOSMAIN.C	Duplicate definition of supstk and SUPSIZ
				removed from this module. (Duplicated in 
				PROC.C and FS.H.)
				If the supervisor stack is to be OEM 
				configurable some more reliable method must be
				devised.

19 Nov 87 ACH	RWA.A		Added _lbmove, _bfill, _bmove routines.
				(These were supposed to be in something called
				TOOLS.ARC which was not supplied by DRI.)
