Hi Seb!

As you can see I made a new preview. The news:
- The dungeon raster background works!! I had to cut the frame size to get 
  it to run in 4vbl.
- Fading to blue in the tunnel screen.
- Right background color in the tower (greet) screen.
- Greetings positions slightly improved (not too much left aligned).

I'd still like a few small improvements:
- Dungeon screen: 
  . The darkened versions of the wall texture look pretty crappy. I supplied
    a PI1. The colours that may be used are: 1 thru 7 (yeps not 0, cos then
    you see the background through the texture!). If you can improve it, I'd
    be delighted!
- Tower screen:
  . The raster is still shaky as hell. This can probably be fixed.

Stay cool stay Atari!
