----------                              we are happy to invite you to outline!  outline is an atari demoscene party thatwill take place at easter 2005 in the   east of holland.                                                                the party will be a great opportunity   to show your creative skills, have a    beer with your friends and ofcourse we  will provide enough space so you can    use or show your hardware and software.                                         although outline is mainly an atari     oriented event, we are also welcoming   like minded sceners using other         platforms for creative purposes.                                                                                        -----------------------------           party location and facilities           -----------------------------           the location for outline 2005 is:                                               kampeerboerderij "te boomsgoed"         langestraat 24                          7047 ap braamt                          the netherlands                         http://www.teboomsgoed.nl/                                                      braamt is a very small village in the   east of holland, near the german border.the area around the partyplace is mainlyin agricultural use or forest.                                                  te boomsgoed is a traditional farmhouse converted to a group accomodation. we   are renting one of the two main halls,  and the sleeping area above it. there   are toilets and showers in the main     building. there's another building some 10 meters away which will soon be       demolished and rebuilt, but since there are still some legal issues to be dealt with before this can take place we mighthave this building available for the    party too (keep your fingers crossed!).                                         in between the two buildings is a huge  terrace, to the sides are a football    field, a campsite, caravans and huts    which you could rent if you're bringing the family, a minigolf court, a horse   barn and school, and plenty parking     spaces.                                                                         there are busstops at a few minutes     walking distance from the partyplace,   but the nearest trainstation is 7.5km   away and it's a bit tricky to get from  there to braamt. we therefore advise youto take the train to "doetinchem de     huet" and give us a call so we can send a car to pick you up. ofcourse we'll    also return you to the station after theparty.                                                                          there's a supermarket about 150 meters  from the party location. also nearby is the "braamse gat", a lake with bungalow park, and a pub. quality restaurants,   including havoc's favourite chinese     place, are in nearby Zeddam (3km), as   well as the oldest windmill in the      country. a little further away is the   city of doetinchem (6km), where you can find many shops, restaurants and pubs.                                          ofcourse we will provide the usual food delivery options such as pizza, kebab,  fries, etc, and you can also buy cool   drinks for very reasonable prices at theparty place.                                                                    the main hall has suitable audio        equipment, and a permament beamer setup with dedicated screen. there's a table  and chair for every visitor, and some   relaxing benches as well (how many will vary a lot depending on the number of   visitors). we will provide a basic      selection of cooled drinks, and those   who visited pmp will be happy to hear   there's a kitchen table and             possibilities for a campfire.           unfortunately we are lacking funds to   dig a pond for the pmp duckies, but you can once again put up a tent or caravan outside the party place if you prefer   that over the regular indoor sleeping   area.                                                                                                                   ------------                            competitions                            ------------

you that theywill be mainly symbolic. we would be    very interested to hear about any ideas you may have to improve this situation, and we will keep on trying to find more sponsors ourselves.                                                                                                     -------                                 tickets                                 -------                                                                         a ticket for the entire party, valid for4 days and 3 nights, including breakfast                                 40 euro

building is limited to 60 visitors, so the numberof full tickets in the first batch is   also limited to 60.                                                             an additional batch of 40 tickets might become available later on, depending on the legal situation of that particular  building as explained before. we will   announce this through the usual channelssuch as our website and dhs.nu.                                                 we recommend booking your tickets well  in advance to avoid disappointment!                                             girls do not get free entry.                                                    we realize that these prices are higher than atari sceners got used to in recentyears. this is mainly because the party is held at a commercial location, unlikeprevious parties which were usually in  schools, universities or clubhouses. we tried our best to get such a location   this year too, but failed. so we decidedto go for the next best option, which is(in our opinion) a commercial location  that may not be the cheapest, but does  offer very good value for money.                                                we would also like to stress that even  though the party location is commercial,the organising team is working on a     strictly non-profit base. any profit theparty will generate will flow directly  into the competition prize fund, and anymoney left after the competitions will  be donated to a worthy cause. for       example, after outline 2004 we donated  the leftover funds to outline 2005.                                                                                     ----------------                        ordering tickets                        ----------------                        you can

travelling                              ----------                              by plane: the preferred airport for     travelling to this party is amsterdam/  schiphol. flights from nearly every     major airport on the planet arrive thereon a daily basis, and travelling from   the airport to the partyplace is easy   because of the excellent railway        connections. a trainticket from schipholto the partyplace is ~18 euro each way, or 11 euro for dutch students and peopletravelling along with them.                                                     travellers from the uk and sweden will  be interested to know that ryanair has  some pretty cheap offers for travelling to airport niederrhein, which is only 45km from the partyplace. if you contact  the organisers well in advance, pickups can be arranged.                                                                other airports within driving distance  from the party place include rotterdam  and eindhoven. if you can get a flight  to one of these airports for a lower    price than you would pay for travelling to schiphol, the organisers can provide you with information on how to get from any of these airports

all, we would like to say we   have a lot of confidence in the visitorswe are inviting to this party. some of  the organisers have been going to atari related easter parties for more than a  decade, and in all those years the      number of unacceptable incidents has    been negligible.                                                                however, we feel that setting a few     clear guidelines will help everyone to  make the party even more enjoyable.                                             - the organisers are very tolerant, but   there are limits. please treat other    people and their property with          respect. illegal and/or destructive     behaviour will not be accepted and can  lead to removal from the party.                                               -
