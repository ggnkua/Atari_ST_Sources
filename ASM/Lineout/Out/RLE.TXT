Human Fly 2 - rle sprite format:

         0 | width
         2 | height
         4 | scanline offset-table
2*height+4 | rle data rle_blocks*(%rnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,data) (r=rle flag)

NOTES:
- offsets are measured in bytes, an offset-table entry is a word
  the offset is the distance from the start of the rle data
- 'nnn..' denotes amount of pixels following headerword
- the rle flag is 0 when pixels are masked out (no data follows!)
  this flag is 1 when data follows
- data is either words or bytes, know if you converted 8b or 16b APX!
