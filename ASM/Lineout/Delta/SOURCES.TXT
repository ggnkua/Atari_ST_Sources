about the delta sources:

this is the complete source of the demo. it features my humanfly 3d engine
and modplayer as well as my demo-os and all libraries. all stuff was coded
with devpac3.1 and qdsp0.13a.

the main demo (including the demo-os) is in demo.s
the human fly engine (dsp implementation) is sfly_dsp.s
the modplayer is earxplao.s
the screens have the *.so extension and are included in parts
the testenvironment dasts.s can be used to test screens standalone
the libraries have the *.i extension

about the future, i hope to release new versions of humanfly soon. both a
cpu version (that also runs on tt/040/060 for instance) and a dsp version
will be done.

happy hacking,

pieter (earx / lineout)
