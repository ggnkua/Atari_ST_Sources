DSPMOD34 September 1, 1999

By bITmASTER of The Chaos Engine


This is an unofficial release of DSPMOD.
It has a few bugfixes and changes made to the
DSPMOD31 package from bITmASTER.

- DSP-restore. No more DSP-crashes after DSPMOD has been used.
- FastRam fix.
- Sound restore. Ym chip will work after DSPMOD.
- General cleanup.

For a full review of all DSPMOD features, unpack bITmASTERs
original distribution (dspmod31.lzh). It shows how to use
oscilloscopes and such things. But beware, the source is
an ASCII dump from Turbo Assembler, not useable with Devpac
or Assemble without changes.


Bye for now, see you in a forthcoming (?) dspmod35.
