        1.1              Background and Greetings


  In the summer of 1992, I started to write a tracker called CD-TRACKER.
This tracker was to be a tool to help me develop an 8-channel module for a
demo.  When the summer was over, and autumn came, I got in touch with
Davor Slutej (Alan F/Reward).  He betatested CD-TRACKER, and soon after
some real heavy coding began.  At about X-mas time, the results were 
released.  With this version 0.5, the name changed from CD-TRACKER to 
Octalyser.  (The name came from an Amiga 8-channel tracker.) 

  I noticed some demos were able to play 50kHz music in 4 channels, which 
really confused me, because I knew that 50kHz shouldn't be possible on an 
ordinary STe.  So I got in touch with Tord Jansson (Blade/New Core), who 
had done a 4 channel, 50kHz Player.  After some mailings back & forth, I 
was able to implement the UCDM3-standard (now called UCDM) in the 
Octalyser, enabling it to load external replay-modules.  Octalyser version
0.80 was released with some of my own written UCDMs (ALINA-players). 

  There was a major jump between versions 0.50 and 0.80.  Overall, version 
0.80 was faster, had many more functions, and was more stable.  Soon after 
version 0.80 was released, a misunderstanding with one of our beta-testers
occurred, and version 0.81b was spread.  This version had some bugs fixed 
(now worked better with HD's). 

  In version 0.82, the Octalyser took real advantage of the Mega STE. 
Then some time passed.  And some more.  Then version 0.90 was released. 
It supported ALL ProTrackerEffectCommands, and it worked on the new Atari
Falcon030.  And now, you're about to use the version 0.96 release of the 
Octalyser.

For help and ideas:

        + Unit 17 (thanks Jason for letting me test the Octalyser on your Mega STE)
        + H†kan Bratt (thanks for debugging!)
        + Excellence in Art (thanks for your BIG support!)

        And a big thanks to all our registered users!




--- Introduction to the Octalyser-User-System -----------------------------


        2.1      Introduction to the Octalyser-User-System

  The Octalyser uses its own interface, designed to be as fast as possible.
That's why the interface doesn't look too colorful.  Adding color would 
have slowed things down too much.  The Octalyser interface is mouse- and 
keyboard-driven.   There are 3 different kinds of mouseclicks (using the 
left mouse-button): 

 -Single click-                  The menu-item will only accept one 
                                 mouseclick without repeat. 
 -Single click + delayed repeat- This will work just like single click 
                                 except from that if the button is held 
                                 down the mouse will start repeating the 
                                 click (if you press the right mouse-
                                 button too, there will be no delay). 
 -Single click + repeat-         This is just like single click + delayed 
                                 repeat but there is no delay before it 
                                 will start to repeat. The user can enter 
                                 a value by pressing on the number, or by 
                                 using up/down arrow.


        2.2      Menus

  The main menu-area is in the upper right part of the screen. Here you
can see 8 different buttons to press, OPTIONS, DISK, INFO, MEM, 
FULL-EDITOR, EDIT, MAKE and SAMPLE.

2.2.1    OPTIONS

  When this button is clicked, a new submenu will be opened, making it
possible to adjust the Octalyser's internal working system. The menu
is divided into 4 parts; sliders, submenus, replay-quality and flags.  

  The SLIDERS adjust the STE-hardware and some keyrepeat-functions. From 
left to right:

                 -STE-specific options

           Bass             -adjust the bass (-12dB -> +12dB)
           Treble           -adjust the treble (-12dB -> +12dB)
           Main volume      -adjust the main volume feed to the output
           Left volume      -adjust the left channels volume
           Right volume     -adjust the right channels volume

                 -Interface options
        
           Keyrepeat-factor  -this will adjust how fast the keyboard will
                                             repeat a key.
           Keydelay-factor   -this will adjust how long it will take before the
                                             keyboard will start repeating a key
           Mousedelay-factor -this will adjust how long it will take before
                                             the mouse will start repeating a click

There are 4 different SUBMENUs; SO, COL, UCDM and SM.

  SO   = Save Options, saves all options.
  COL  = COLors, enables the user to edit the colors used in the Octalyser.
  UCDM = External play-routines. In this submenu, you can select 4 
          different players. (If you have them loaded.) You can clear a 
          position, load a position, and you can get information about the
          player. When you want to use a player, select it and press USE. 
          After a brief delay, the Octalyser will use an external player. 
          The TOnes-value should be as high as possible (more tones
          require more memory). The BP (Big Pattern) menu enables you to 
          select how many rows will be displayed in the 4-channel pattern 
          (on the lower part of the screen).
  SM   = Save Memory. This option is rather complicated. It will set the
          number of patterns the Octalyser can use. Max 80 (hex) and min 
          1 pattern can be selected. When you can't load a module because 
          there is no room for samples, then you can decrease this value. 
          If this value is 10 (hex) and you try to load a module that 
          contains 14 (hex) patterns, the loader will abort at once, 
          stating that there is no memory left.  Increase this value to 
          be able to load that module. This option is added because
          all 1 Mb STEs will have some memory problems because each 
          pattern requires 800 (hex) bytes. A value of 40 (hex) is quite 
          enough for most modules.


  In REPLAY-QUALITY, you can adjust what replay-speed the INTERNAL
replayer will play. You can select between 12.5, 15.5, 18.9 and 25.0 kHz,
AntiAlias on or off, and 4, 6 or 8 channels.

  The FLAGS are options-extended buttons. They are: B, R, V, L, T, L-Noise,
16, 20, 25 and nops.

  B =       BPM. Enable the player to use the F20-FFF effectcommands. Some
             UCDM's can't use this feature.
  R =       Repeat. If you hit a tone with this flag set, and hold down 
             the key, the tone will start to repeat.  Otherwise, no repeat
             will occur.
  V =       VU-meters. VU-meters on/off
  L =       Loop. This flag SHOULD be set on computers that have internal 
             CPU-cache (like Mega STE/Falcon and turbocards like ADSPEED). 
             On a normal STE, this flag WILL be off.
  T =       Trash. This flag should always be set.
  L-Noise = Only for STE. This is a real nice feature, because of the
             linenoise that the STE (not the Falcon) produces.  When the 
             Octalyser is not playing, the linenoise can be removed by 
             enabling this option.  If a module sounds strange (like 
             "clicking" a lot), try turning this option off.
16,20,25 =  Sets the basespeed that the samples have been sampled with.
             For normal Amigamodules, it should be 16.  For TCB tracker-
             sampled samples, this option should be 20. If you sample new 
             samples, please try to use the 25 basespeed option. This will
             enable you to play 50kHz samples in the Octalyser. (The 
             number <16/20/25> is equal to the C-3 frequency, e.g. if you 
             sample a sample in 25 kHz and select 25 kHz basespeed, then 
             when you play C-3, the sample will replay in the sampled 
             speed).
nops =      If the lower border flickers, then adjust this value until the
             lower border is stable.


        2.2.2    DISK

  From the disk-menu you can load/save modules/samples, delete files and
jump to a GEM-door (making it possible to reach ACC's (if MTOS is loaded,
you can also reach all active processes running).  In the unregistered
version, you can't save modules/samples.  If you use UCDM you can only 
load modules, delete files and go to the GEM-door.  Disable the UCDM-module
when you want to load samples and save module/samples.
  When loading a module, the Octalyser will use GEM's fileselector.  After
you have selected the module, the Octalyser will check to see if it
recognizes the file format, then report what it finds (e.g. 4 CHannels, 31
SAMples).  If you know that the file isn't in that format, press NO, else
press YES (Octalyser recognize most modules.  The only problem could be a
ripped module that doesn't have the original header).  If you pressed NO, 
select the fileformat of the module from the options given. 
  Now the Octalyser will load the module.  If it aborts immediately, 
stating NO MEMORY, you'll need to increase the number of patterns in the 
SM-menu in the OPTIONS-menu. (See above.)  When loading the module, the 
Octalyser will show you which sample is loading.  If the Octalyser can't 
load all the samples, you'll need to decrease the numbers of patterns in 
the SM-menu in the OPTIONS-menu. (Again, see above.)  The Octalyser can 
load StarTrekker (Amiga), Octalyser (Amiga), FastTracker (PC) and all 
those 4-channel modules from NoiseTracker/ProTracker/SoundTracker.
  When saving a module (disabled in the PD-version) the Octalyser will 
save the module with the numbers of channels and basespeed you've stated 
in the OPTIONS-menu.
  The Octalyser can load AVR, IFF and RAW (signed/unsigned) samples. It
recognizes the AVR and IFF format automatically, but in the RAW format you
must state if the sample is signed or unsigned (most samples are signed, 
but some old ST-samples are unsigned).
  The Octalyser can save AVR or RAW (signed).  If you enter a filename with
the suffix .AVR, the Octalyser will save in AVR-format, else it will ask
the user how the sample should be saved.  (Saving samples are disabled in
the PD-version).
  If you choose to delete a file, it is deleted PERMANENTLY. For that
reason, the Octalyser will ask for confirmation before preforming a delete.
  In the GEM-door, you will be able to execute another program or reach 
the Accessories.  In this door, you can quit the Octalyser, too.  Press 
"Back To Octalyser" in the File-menu or on the fuller in the window.


2.2.3    INFO

  This button opens an online help feature.  It states who made it, some
greetings, keyboard shortcuts, effect-commands and to whom the program is
registered. Use Prev and Next to display all 9 pages.


        2.2.4    MEM

  In this menu, the Octalyser shows the memory-bank status.  The Octalyser
splits up the memory in two different banks.  One systembank and one
Octalyserbank.  The systembank is the memory left for the system, for the
fileselector and for running program from the Octalyser.  The Octalyserbank
is used for pattern, samples, UCDM and some internal buffers.

 The different statistics are:

         SYSMEM           -How much memory is left for the system.
         REQUEST          -How much memory the Octalyser has requested from
                            the system. This value is editable, when changing
                            this value, everything is lost (samples/patterns/UCDMs).
         SAMPLES          -How much memory is used for samples
         SONG             -How much memory is used for pattern
         TOT USED         -How much memory used in the complete Octalyserbank
         FREE             -Free memory left in the complete Octalyserbank

  SAMPLES + SONG = length of module when saving to disk.


        2.2.5    FULLEDITOR

  When pressing this button the Octalyser will (if there is enough memory)
remove the menu and show a pattern in the whole display-area.  In this 
mode all channels are displayed. Exit this by pressing ESC/Control E or 
by pressing the mousebutton in the leftmost border.  In this fulleditor 
only keyboard shortcuts works.


        2.2.6    EDIT

  This will open a pattern editor menu.  Here the user can effect the
pattern of the module.  Most of the functions can be used without entering
this menu using the keyboard.  The edit-functions are also controlled by 
EDITING-FLAGS.  They are in the lower area of the menu (between the 2 and 
3 channel).  The modes on those will be discussed later on in the GENERAL
section.

The functions are:

         BEGIN   =  Set block start (Control - B).
         END     =  Set block end (Control - K)
         HIDE    =  Hides the block begin and end
         COPY    =  Will take the block marked by the BEGIN and END-marks and
                          copy it to the current cursorposition (Control - C).
         MOVE    =  Will take the block marked by the BEGIN and END-marks and
                          move it to the current cursorposition (Control - V).
         CLEAR   =  Clears the patterndata marked by the BEGIN and END-marks
                          (Control - Z). If no block marked, current channel will
                          be cleared (F3).
         INVERT  =  Works like MOVE, except that the block is inverted
                          before copied (Control - X).
         LOAD    =  Loads a block into the blockbuffer
         SAVE    =  Saves a block from the blockbuffer
         ^       =  Increases the tonepitch in the block. If no block marked,
                          the current channel will be increased.
         v       =  Decreases the tonepitch in the block. If no block marked,
                          the current channel will be decreased.
         INS     =  Inserts a row in the current position (INSERT or Control - I)
         DEL     =  Deletes a row in the current position (DELETE or Control - Y)

  The cur/all marks if blockeffects should affect the current channel or 
all channels.  Use SHIFT+keycommand for that effect using the keyboard. If
cur is selected when transposing (increasing or decreasing) then only the
current sample will be transposed.  Else all samples will be transposed in
the channel.


        2.2.7    MAKE

  Make is one of the most powerful options of the Octalyser.  This menu
enables you to mix a piece of pattern to a sample.  Great when making
drumloop or accords.  It works like it's in 8-channel mode, but instead of
feeding the sound-DMA with data, it simply puts the sound data into a 
sample.  The "Mix to sample" tells the Octalyser to which sample the sound
data should be stored.  Tone is at which frequency it should store it. 
That tone should be set to the highest tone taken in the piece of pattern 
that shall be made.  The CLIP is useful to decide at which volume the mix 
should be done.  (Note that the lower the volume-value, the louder the 
volume!)  Then after setting the block BEGIN and END, the mixing can be 
done.  The mixing is started at the BEGIN and ended at the END-point.


2.2.8    SAMPLE/8 PATTERN/4 PATTERN

  With this option you can switch what the lower part of the screen should
show.  The sample-menu is NOT finished, so it can only display a sample on 
the screen.
  8 pattern is a fullscreen-editor with the original menu.  This screen
can only be shown when there is sufficient memory, else it simply jumps
to 4 pattern.  When you are in 8 pattern mode, and try to start a UCDM you
will get "PLEASE DISABLE 8PATTERNEDITOR".  This is due to the internal
function of the memory-manager.  When this error occurs, simply go to 
the 4-pattern editor, and try again.  Then go back to the 8 pattern editor.
Note that the left border is turned on again due to video-hardware, but 
you can still use the slider to scroll trough the pattern.  When in the 8
pattern-editor, switching between fullscreen-editor and back is done
extremely fast.


        2.3      SEQUENCER

  The sequencer is the simplest, as in all trackers. You have position,
track (pattern), length and restart.  Position tells you were you are.
Pattern selects which pattern to play.  The length is the length of all
positions together.  When the song reaches the end, it jumps to the
position that Restart points at.  The little +/- at the position
inserts/deletes a position in the position-list.


        2.4      SAMPLE-BANK

  The Octalyser handles up to 31 samples (1-IF (hex)).  Each sample can 
have different volume, finetune, loopstart/length, length and samplename. 
The volume can vary from 0 (silent) to 40 (full blast).  With the finetune 
it is possible to tune two instrument.  The samplename should state what 
the sample sounds like.


2.5      GENERAL-USER-INTERFACE

  To the leftmost of the screen you have the VU-meters.  They represent the
volume that each tone has, and then they fade away.  By pressing on a
VU-meter, the channel is toggled on/off.  It has the same effect as if
pressing the 1-8 in the upper right corner of the screen.
  There are 5 buttons in the middle of the screen; PLAY, PATTERN, EDIT, 
STOP and MONITOR.  These works like in any tracker.  PLAY plays the current
song.  PATTERN plays only the current pattern.  EDIT starts the edit-mode.
STOP stops playing and stops the current sound.  MONITOR starts the edit-
mode too, but when the user walks though the pattern each row is played.
  Pressing on the text "songname" switches the songname to a list of
numbers, representing a sample.  (e.g. pressing on a 7 forces the current
sample to 7.)  By pressing on "songname" again the songname appears again.
  At the right there is a button called CLEAR.  This button enables the 
user to clear the song (and all patterns), a sample (the current) and/or 
all samples.  Warning!  This function CAN'T be Undone!
  Under the CLEAR-button there is a timer.  This shows the minutes and
seconds played on the current module (resets when you press PLAY or
PATTERN).  When pressing the timer, the fullscreen-editor is activated.
  In the SAMPLENAME-row, some messages can be shown, like "INSTALLING
EDITOR" or "REBUILDING MEMORY".
  Just below the SONGNAME there is a general row of data.  Here the user 
can set if the upper or lower frequency should be used on the keyboard.  
Also here is where the 4-pattern-editor tells the user which 4 channels are
being shown.  The STEP states how many rows the Octalyser shall jump when a
note/number has been edited into a channel.
  The "F TAA W R" are flags used when editing a pattern.  These are very
powerful.  F stands for Flags.  The TAA is a toggle-button.  The first, T, 
is used when a TONE is edited to the pattern.  The values can be Frequency,
Tone, All and Volume.  The second, A, is for insert/delete and backspace
editing.  Can be Frequency, Tone, Sample, Command, Data, Effect and All.
The third, A, is used when using the block-editing.  It can be toggled just
like the other A.  The W stands for Writing-mode, and is used when copying
or moving block.  Can be toggled to Replace, Underwrite or Overwrite.  To
understand exactly what the do, please try them out!  Just to the right of
the flag, the status of the blockbuffer is shown.
  To the lower left, there is a slider representing the pattern data
displayed and hidden.  Use this to scroll through the pattern.  By pressing
in the pattern, the Octalyser automatically jumps to that position even if
it's playing the pattern.  Note that you can use cursor-keys to walk in 
the pattern even if the tracker is playing.


        2.6      Keyboard-short-cuts

  Here is a list of all keyboard shortcuts enabled in the Octalyser:

         Escape                  =   Quit menu/Octalyser
         Cursor up               =   Up 1 step
         Cursor down             =   Down 1 step
         Shift cursor up         =   Up STEP steps
         Shift cursor down       =   Down STEP steps         
         Ctrl cursor up 	 =   Up 16 (hex) steps
         Ctrl cursor down        =   Down 16 (hex) steps
         Cursor left             =   Go left
         Cursor right            =   Go right
         Shift cursor left       =   Leftmost channel (1)
         Shift cursor right      =   Rightmost channel (4/6/8)
         Ctrl cursor left        =   Next channel
         Ctrl cursor right       =   Previous channel
         Alt cursor left         =   Previous track/pattern
         Alt cursor right        =   Next track/pattern
         Clr home                =   Home                      
         Return                  =   Play
