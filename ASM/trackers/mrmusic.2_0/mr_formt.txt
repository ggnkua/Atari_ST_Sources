First, a few words from The Phantom:

Hello my little diamonds!  Here, for your benefit/pleasure, is the Mr Music 
file format structure so you can make your own .SNG files in whichever manner 
you want, or to simply convert soundtracker (aggh!) format to Mr Music.
Hope you find this information useful - contact me if you have any problems 
(address below) or leave me some mail on CONTACT BBS (London England) on:
+44 (081) 6460746 9PM to 9AM UK time.  You can also call it for other things 
- it's the best board for your programming/demo/naughty needs!



SECTION 1 - Features.

Apart from being blindingly fast, Mr Music has several features which make it 
a little bit more 'special'...
Ability to manipulate over 32000 samples.
Samples can be up to 64K in length.
Extremely small .SNG file size.
Plays from current sample pointer or start of sample (selectable).
Looped samples (or vice versa) can be automatically made non-looped.
It is not restricted by fixed length patterns.
Has up to 255 pattern loops.
Duration of a note/slide/rest up to 32767 units (about 10 minutes!).
And a few more, but they're to do with the player itself.


SECTION 2 - .SNG FILE FORMAT.

Mr Music files are so small because it works bit-wise.  Some may moan for the 
'slowness' of this method (which it isn't!!!);  The Phantom programmed Mr 
Music mainly to emulate an expensive keyboard, not a 0.000% CPU time, 
old-fashioned music driver.  The main advantage of this bit wise format 
(apart from compactness) is that ALL operations are perfromed AT THE SAME 
TIME.  Poor music drivers (like soundtracker and all the derivatives) perform 
their functions one-at-a-time.  For example; in soundtracker or whatever, if 
you want to play a note and slide it then the driver waits one frame (being 
1/50th second or whatever it is calibrated at) to play the note, then the 
next to slide it.  This is hardly noticeable (actually you can't notice it AT 
ALL!) but it's not right.  Mr Music does it the proper way - performing all 
operations concurrently!!!


SONG FORMAT

Simple - you have four 'channels', each channel's data is terminated by a 
negative value of -9999.  Note that this NEEDS to be -9999 and NO OTHER.
The four channels' data is one after the other.  That is, channel 1's data is 
first, then a -9999, then channel 2's data, then -9999 and so on, until the 
end of channel 4 (again, signalled by a WORD value of -9999).  While playing, 
when -9999 is reached, the player will automatically loop to the start of the 
channel's data and start again.

The actual musical data is governed by a command word, and acted on bitwise 
and step-by-step.  That is, it starts processing bit 0, then 1 then 2... 
Taking each bit's relevant data in step.


Here's a quick summary.  The number of '1 W' means the number of WORDS 
(2-byte values) that it needs as data.

COMMAND WORD:

Word (bits) - 0100000000001111
               |__________||||___ Sustain.  Does auto sustain (0 = off).
                          ||||
                          |______ Rest. 1 W: Duration.
                           |||
                           |_____ Slide. 1 W: To note, 1 W: Speed, 1 W: Dur.
                            ||
                            |____ New note. 1 W: Note, 1 W: Duration.
                             |
                             |___ New sample. 1 W: Sample number.

(Dur. means duration.)

(Pattern loops will be explained later)


BIT 15 - Sustain.
This needs no data.  This bit in the command word just says that this sample 
(if any) has a loop.  You can have sustain on non-loop samples; it will 
simply loop from the start of the sample.

BIT 0  - New sample.
This bit sets a new sample.  It does not play a new sample unless a note or 
slide command is issued.
It needs one WORD signifying the sample number (starting from 0).

BIT 1  - New note.
This bit sets a new note - actually playing the sample at your required note.
It needs two WORDS.  The first word is the note (0-63 with 31 being the 
middle (440Hz) note).  The second word the duration in VBL's (in units of 
1/50th of a second at 50Hz or 1/60th of a second at 60hz).  So a duration 
value of 25 will play the note for 1/2 a second at 50Hz.  Note that this is 
also the time until the next command word is read.

BIT 2  - Slide.
This performs a note slide.  For speed, it is not as 'smooth' as other 
trackers, but used right, it is very good.
It needs three WORDS.  The first word is the destination note it slides to 
(from 0-63), the second word is the slide speed in 1/50ths of a second (or 
1/60th at 60Hz).  The third word is the duration of the slide.  If the slide 
speed is 2, then slides are performed at 2/50ths of a second (or at 60Hz, 
2/60ths) and so on.  Please do not let the slide speed exceed the duration 
time, otherwise it might go all strange!  Say the duration time is 30.  If it 
has to slide from note 0 to note 63 every 2 units, then it will not reach the 
destination note in time (2*63 = 126, which exceeds 30 by a lot!).  A slide 
from note 10 to 20 at 3 units WILL just do it; 10-20= 10 notes to slide, * 3 
units each = 30 duration units (just in, so it will work).  Note that slides 
that fall well within the duration time will work - they sustain the 
destination note for the remaining time until the next note or slide command. 
One thing: the smaller the slide speed, the faster it will slide (1 being the 
fastest and 32767 the slowest).
Note that this is also the time until the next command word is read.

BIT 3 - Rest.
This simply 'rests' (stops playing the sample) for the required time.
It needs one WORD.  The word value is in 1/50ths of a second at 50Hz (or 
1/60ths of a second at 60Hz).  So a duration value of 50 would wait for 1 
second (at 50Hz).  Note that this is also the time until the next commnd word 
is read.


Now's a little demonstration of a typical command sequence:

Example - Say we want to play a new sample with middle note... Then it would 
look like this:  (DC.W in assembler is DEFINE CONSTANT of word length)

 dc.w  %0100000000000011
 dc.w  0    Sample number.
 dc.w  31   Note.
 dc.w  6    Duration.
Observe that the sustain (loop sample) bit is set.  The above sequence will 
start playing a sample at middle note for 6 units.

And now, let's say that we only want to slide from the current note (which, 
say, is 31) to a higher note (slide taking place immediately):

 dc.w  %0000000000000100
 dc.w  41   Destination note.
 dc.w  2    Speed of slide.
 dc.w  80   Duration.
Observe that the sustain (loop sample) bit is off (just to show that you can 
toggle a sample's loop status on-the-fly!).  The above sequence (on hearing 
it) will slide from middle note (assuming it WAS that) to a higher note and 
hold it there until the duration ends (since the slide will get there before 
the note ends).

How about a new (looped) sample (number 2) at note 40 sliding down to 30 with 
duration 10?  Simple.
 dc.w  %0100000000000111
 dc.w  1    Sample number (remember, we start from 0).
 dc.w  40   Note.
 dc.w  99   Duration - this one is ignorend since the slide's dur. is taken.
 dc.w  30   Slide to this note.
 dc.w  1    Slide every 1 unit.
 dc.w  10   Duration of 10 units.

Pattern loops:
Each voice has INDEPENDENTLY handled loops.  That is, they have no fixed 
sequence like soundtrackers - this means that the music has a much greater 
scope for musical change & rhythm, but the downside of this method is that 
you have to look out that all four channels loop at the same time, otherwise 
the music will restart out of sync.  Mind you, you could always use this to 
your advantage and make music NOT loop properly to get a sort-of infinite 
length song!

Pattern loops are governed with a negative command word with the value of 
-128 followed by the identical loop values (minus one) as two bytes - Eg 9,9 
giving nine loops followed by a word containing the offset to the start of 
the pattern to be looped.  Remember, that looping THREE times means that the 
section will play ONCE, then loop THREE times (so you hear it four times).
There is a maximum of 256 loops.

An example:
 dc.w  -128   Signal pattern loop.
 dc.b  3,3    Loop 3 times.  Remember, pair those loops!
 dc.w  40     Loop back 40 bytes from here.  The loop offset.
...  Continues here after 3 loops.
 The above shows a 40 byte pattern being looped 3 times (+1 played).

When it jumps back, it subtracts the loop offset value from the address where 
the loop offset is.  To clarify, here's a pattern repeat command that will 
loop back on itself and therefore stay doing that forever!
 dc.w  -128   Signal pattern loop.
 dc.w  1,1    Loop once (no matter - this example will loop forever!).
 dc.w  4      Loop back 4 bytes from here.


When a pattern has looped the required amount of times, it will 'fall though' 
and continue on to the next command word.


Bits & bobs:

There are 10 bits (10 commands) left in the command word.  These bits are 
reserved for future versions; planned are:
Volume control.
Flange and digital distortion effects.
Echo/room/hall/crossfade effects.
Digital filtering.
Infinite note range.
All these features are NOT in this version simply because of speed and use. 
When the right hardware comes along (like Atari's new Jaguar - we're hoping 
that Atari have the good sense of making a computer out of it), or we figure 
a way of doing any of the above without slowing Mr Music down too much.

A command word containing the word value -9999 will signify the end of
that channel's song and will loop back to the start of the channel data.

NOTE:
When a new note or slide is performed, the sample is not re-started.  This is 
because of the end-sustain feature, where you can play a new note on a looped 
sample without making it play from the start (this allows you to do some very 
nice effects without a 'key release').  For example, say you have a looped 
sample that is someone's voice saying "HELLO YOU" and when it loops it says 
"YOU YOU YOU YOU..." and so on.  When you play a new note, it will play from 
the "YOU YOU..." point, NOT from the start of the sample.  If you DO want the 
slide or note to be in effect from the START of the sample (as in from the 
"HELLO..." point) then you signal a NEW SAMPLE with the sample value.  This 
allows you flexibility - you can play the sample from the start, or continue 
from the current point (yay!).

Here's an example 4-channel song (note that all the other 3 channels are 
empty, thus filled with a rest of 1 unit).  This is what a basic .SNG file 
would look like.

CHANNEL 1.
 dc.w  %0100000000000011        Play new sample (looped) and note.
 dc.w  0                        Sample number (0 = first sample).
 dc.w  63                       Note (63 is highest).
 dc.w  50                       Duration (50 units = 1 second at 50Hz).
 dc.w  -128                     Pattern loop.
 dc.b  3,3                      Loop three times.
 dc.w  12                       12 bytes back from here.
 dc.w  %0100000000000100        Slide current note.
 dc.w  31                       To note 31 (middle).
 dc.w  1                        Speed.
 dc.w  40                       Duration.
 dc.w  %0100000000000101        Slide from sample start.
 dc.w  0                        Sample number.
 dc.w  40                       To note 40.
 dc.w  2                        Speed.
 dc.w  80                       Duration.
 dc.w  -9999                    END OF CHANNEL 1.
CHANNEL 2.
 dc.w  %0000000000001000        Rest.
 dc.w  1                        Duration of 1 unit.
 dc.w  -9999                    END OF CHANNEL 2.
CHANNEL 3.
 dc.w  %0000000000001000        Rest.
 dc.w  1                        Duration of 1 unit.
 dc.w  -9999                    END OF CHANNEL 3.
CHANNEL 4.
 dc.w  %0000000000001000        Rest.
 dc.w  1                        Duration of 1 unit.
 dc.w  -9999                    END OF CHANNEL 4.

The above will play a few notes & slides on channel 1, while the other 
channels are quiet (it doesn't matter that all the channels loop at the same 
point, since only one channel is heard).  Note that any empty channels need 
to be filled with a rest (of any duration).


SECTION 3 - .EIT file structure.

Right, here's the sample (.EIT) file structure.

NOTE:  One of the principal speed factors of Mr Music is because of a naughty 
trick The Phantom did with the sample ends (lately, it seems, people have 
been using this technique for their trackers...  Wonder why??!!).  You NEED 
to do this 'trick' otherwise the sample playback will not work plroperly.
The one problem this has is that your samples are 1.4 K longer.  Yikes!  When 
you have a lot of samples (even if they are 128 bytes each) then expect the 
size to grow.  The reason is:
Each sample has 1400 bytes (1.4K) tagged on at the end of it.  This is done 
so the player has to do NO loop/end checks (saving about 10% CPU time or 
more!!!).  If the sample has no loop, then you tag onto the end of it null 
bytes with the value 128 (or any value but this works best) - remember, 1400 
bytes of null data.  If it DOES have a loop, then tag 1400 bytes FROM the 
loop start.  Say the sample is 4096 bytes long and the loop is at 230 bytes. 
Then you tag 1400 bytes from start_of_sample+230 bytes.  A problem arises 
when the loop point to the end of the sample is less than 1400 bytes in 
length.  In this case, you keep copying from the loop pointer until you reach 
1400 bytes (E.G.  If the sample loop is at 23 bytes from the start of the 
sample and there's only 60 bytes from there to the end of the sample) you 
copy 37 (60-23) byte blocks until you reach 1400 bytes copied).
With small samples with no loop, there's none of this since you merely tag on 
1400 bytes of null data.
Note that the maximum length of a sample is 64K (65535 bytes).


Data structure:

The first 'block' (of two) contains the sample offsets, lengths and loop 
points.  The second 'block' contains the actual samples.

In the first 'block' the data is as follows.
A LONGWORD (4-byte value) containing this instrument's offset from the end of 
this block.  This is very simple to work out.  Just get the sample's address 
and subtract it from the address of the start of your sample block.  Simple 
as that!
A WORD (2-byte value) containing the sample length.
A WORD (2-byte value) containing thhe sample loop point (=0 if none).

...  This continues for the number of instruments you have and then to signal 
the end of the block you put in a negative WORD (2-byte value) as the sample 
offset (for example, a -9999).  Immediately after that the sample data 
starts; note that you do not need to mark the end of the sample data block.

To make things clearer, here's a little assembly listing to help you.  It 
does not have any 68000 code, so it should be pretty simple!
