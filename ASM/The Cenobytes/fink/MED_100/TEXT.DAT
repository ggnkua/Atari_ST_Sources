 READ ALL TEXT !!         PRESS THE KEYS F1 TO F10 FOR MUSIX               THIS IS MENU NUMBER 100....  AND IS THE LAST NUMBERED MENU THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE FROM US..........           YES, YOU DID READ THAT CORRECTLY, WE WILL NOT BE DOING ANY MORE NUMBERED MENUS FROM NOW ON........   THIS IS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT I WILL NOW TRY TO EXPLAIN......             1. HOW MANY PEOPLE JUST WRITE 'MEDWAY 88', 'AUTOMATION 321' OR 'BBC 20' ON A DISK AND THEN JUST FILE IT IN THEIR COLLECTION, NEVER TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN......  WE WANT PEOPLE TO COLLECT GAMES, NOT JUST MENU NUMBERS          2. HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED COLLECTING THE LAST 200 AUTOMATION DISKS IF THEY DID NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATION MENU NUMBER ON THEM.....    IF YOU WERE GIVEN A DISK WITH NO MENU, AND FOUR CRAP GAMES ON IT YOU WOULD HAVE NO HESITATION IN BINNING IT, YET PEOPLE ARE STILL COLLECTING THIS SHIT FROM AUTOMATION (MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE USED TO AUTOMATION PRODUCING SHIT !!)         3. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BINNED A FULLY WORKING SINGLE DISK TRAINER VERSION OF A GAME FOR THE AUTOMATION VERSION WITH SOME CRAPPY PD GAME ON WITH IT......  THIS IS NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA AS YOU MAY THINK, 'CAUSE UNTRAINED FILE VERSIONS OF GAMES ARE NEVER FULLY TESTED, AND YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AT JUST HOW MANY OF THESE GAMES DON'T WORK PAST LEVEL 2 OR 3         4. ANYONE CAN PRODUCE LOTS OF CRAP MENUS, ALL YOU NEED IS OTHER GROUPS CRACKED GAMES AND A CHUNK PACKER.....    MULTI-PACK THE FILES OVERNIGHT, SPEND 2 MINUTES IN THE MORNING PUTTING A FILE LOADER ON THE FRONT, AND HEY PRESTO..... YOU CAN NOW JOIN AUTOMATION !!!!      OK, SO MAYBE THE GAME NOW TAKES 4 TIMES AS LONG TO LOAD, HAS NO TRAINER, AND DOESN'T WORK PAST LEVEL 3....  BUT IT'S PACKED, AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS ISN'T IT.......           5. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL THE LATEST STUFF GETS CRACKED AND SPREAD, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT'S PACKED AND ON A MENU WITH ANOTHER 2 GAMES YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYWAY    .........  IF WE FORGET THAT, THEN THE ST SCENE WILL SOON END UP IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE AMIGA                  6. PEOPLE SAY THAT COLLECTING COMPACTED MENUS SAVES YOU DISKS.....  BOLLOCKS, MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME GAME ON ABOUT 2 OR 3 DIFFERENT MENUS, SO HOW DOES THAT SAVE ANY DISK SPACE......     ALSO, IF YOU COLLECT JUST AUTOMATION DISKS (AS THEY ADVISE YOU TO DO !!), YOU WILL END UP WITH SO MUCH OLD CRAP THAT YOU DON'T WANT IN YOUR COLLECTION THAT YOU WILL ALSO BE WASTING A LOT OF DISK SPACE !!!!      7. IF YOU'VE BEEN WONDERING WHY A LOT OF THE MENUS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE ONLY HAD TWO GAMES ON THEM, IT'S BECAUSE MOST OF THE NEW GAMES ARE ALREADY PACKED BY THE PROGRAMMERS, SO THERE IS INCREASINGLY LESS POINT IN DOING 'COMPACTED MENUS'          8. IS IT BETTER TO HAVE A SMALL COLLECTION OF GOOD GAMES THAT YOU ENJOY PLAYING, OR A LARGE COLLECTION THAT YOU WILL NEVER EVEN LOOK AT.....               ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS COLLECT AND PLAY GAMES, NOT MENU NUMBERS.....   AND FOR THIS REASON, WE'VE DECIDED TO STOP DOING MENUS.......      I'LL STILL BE CRACKING, PACKING, FILING AND TRAINING GAMES.....  BUT NOW YOU'LL BE GETTING THEM EVEN FASTER, 'CAUSE I WON'T BE WAITING 3 WEEKS UNTIL A CRAPPY 100K GAME ARRIVES TO RELEASE IT ALL AS A MENU !!!!               I'M NOT SAYING THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE ON ONE DISK, IF I GET 2 OR 3 NEW GAMES THAT CAN BE PACKED ONTO ONE DISK THEN I'LL DO THAT, BUT WHAT I WON'T BE DOING IS WAITING ANOTHER 2 WEEKS TO MAKE IT ALL INTO ANOTHER MENU NUMBER !!!      OK, THAT'S ENOUGH ON THAT SUBJECT FOR NOW, BUT JUST WATCH OUT FOR 'COMPILATION' DISKS OF THE LASTEST STUFF IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.......                     A BIG 'GO DIE' MUST GO TO THE D.R.S. OF AUTOMATION FOR 'BORROWING' AND EDITING OUR TEAM YANKEE DOCS.......   IF YOU WANT DOCS, THEN DO THEM YOURSELVES !!!          WHY NOT JUST TAKE ONE OF OUR LATEST MENUS, REPLACE OUR MENU WITH ONE OF YOUR OWN, AND CREDIT US WITH THE CRACKS, PACKS AND ORIGINALS ON THE SCROLLER......  THIS WILL PROBABLY BE YOUR NEXT TRICK !!!                       OH YEAH, NEARLY FORGOT, A QUICK MESSAGE TO GUIDO.......         R.I.P.   (REST IN PAIN)                  I SUPPOSE IT'S ABOUT TIME I ACTUALLY TOLD YOU WHAT WAS ON THIS MENU......  WELL YOU CAN PRESS THE FOLLOWING KEYS     1. SUPER OFF ROAD RACER      2. CABAL      3. PRO SOCCER 2190      4. BODYSHOP            PRO SOCCER 2190 WAS UPLOADED BY THE BBC AND PACKED A WHOLE 2K SMALLER BY ME !!!!                     HEY ILLEGAL, I LIKED THE NEW INTRO ON YOUR LOST PATROL CRACK, BUT I DIDN'T AGREE WITH YOUR CHARTS......   I'LL SAY ONE THING THOUGH, YOU WERE RIGHT TO AVOID A CRACKERS CHART !!!!             IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT TRIED TO HACK A GAME TO JUDGE HOW GOOD A CERTAIN CRACKER IS.....   MOST OF THE GAMES ARE SO EASY TO CRACK THAT THEY DO NOT REALLY GIVE A GOOD INDICATION ANYWAY.......     IT'S A LIMITED FEW TITLES LIKE FUTURE WARS, OPERATION STEALTH, CADAVER, DUNGEON MASTER, PIRATES, CAPTIVE, SPACE ACE, SIERRA ADVENTURES AND WAR HELI THAT REALLY SORT THE MEN OUT FROM THE BOYS !!!!
