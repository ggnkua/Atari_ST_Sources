Hi Neil,
       Just thought I would say a short word on the source code 
I've included on this disk.

     Both are the same code, only on CD 18 the bounce has been 
turned off!

     The source isn't too bad, but wait till you see my next menu 
which will be CD 19.  I have written a slideshow program which 
enables you to pack screen piccies (any format using IFF converter 
to change to Degas or Neo) plus use pack Ice or Automation 2.3r to 
pack still further!

     Plus I will also be using BloodAngels new menu source, which 
was first used on CD 16.  Could you maybe send me up some slide-
shows for me to pack onto menus.

     I have also this time included some Automation & G-Force 
source code Disks, I don't know if you have already got them but 
if you haven't, do not let on I gave you them as I wasn't to 
distribute them. I feel I can trust you though!


     Well thats about all I can think of for the moment, If I 
think of anything else to say I'll put  it in the letter


                              Robert
