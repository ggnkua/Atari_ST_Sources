All code written by Norman Feske (NO/Escape) in 07'98
during 5 days of fear and pain :-)
Nothing is optimized!

The demo is divided into three parts. The loaderprg loads
and executes each part seperately. The first part (ILLNESS.SRC)
contains the escapelogo, the flashing words, the colorblender,
the spiral and the lavaplasma. The second part contains the
waveeffect and kaleidoskope. The third part (NIGHT.SRC)contains 
the wobbling nasty women, the flighteffect (is nearly the same
as the colorblender in part I) and the endscreen.

Short description of the effects:
textscreen: the font is taken from Calamus using a snapshotprg
            a small conversionprogram. The rotating Objects
            in the background are realized with a polyfill-
            routine using the blitter.
colorblend: based on resonance. The result of a zoomed picture
            is used as sourcepicture for the next frame.
spiral:     something like a mixture of a resonanceeffect and
            a rotozoomer. As in the colorblendeffect the result
            of one frame is used for generating the new frame.
            The new frame is generated by reading out the 
            existing frame like a rotozoomer.
lavaplasma: a faked bumpmapping using nice bitmaps as light-
            source and bumpmap.
waves:      made using a lot of screens. In every frame only
            one circle of the whole screen is drawn. The move-
            ment is just the result of screenccyling (like in
            the unlimited bobs effect).
kalaidosk.: A rotozoomer is only displayed on a small triangle,
            mirrored diagonal and finally mirrored horizontal.
            The vertical mirror is implemented by using the
            timer b. In every timer b exception the current
            videoadress is manipulated.
smoothwobbl:In the precalculatingphase the picture is smoothed
            several times. While displaying the screen the
            different smoothed pictures were read out. (The
            effect is nearly the same as the plasmaeffect in
            poweroff-4ktro)
flight:     The same like the blendeffect in part I but with
            another zoomfactor.

Sorry there are only a very few comments in the sourcecode.
