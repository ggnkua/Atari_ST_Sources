Here is the whole sourcecode of Escape4ktro. I released this
program at the InterCon'96 party and it won the first price.
(there was only one other entry) This Intro was the result of
a meeting of Coke/Therapy and me in NÅrnberg in summer'96.

    ESC4KTRO.SRC   The main sourcecode, programmed with Turbo-
                   Assembler.
                   
    DSP_ROUT.56K   The DSP-sourcecode. The DSP calculates the
                   fire.
                   
    FIREPAL.EPP    An Escape Paint palette, which is only used
                   for the first and second screen.
                   
    RGB_HITC.SCP   Screens Pain sequences for setting the right
    VGA_HITC.SCP   resolution.
                   
    X*.MAP         These datafiled are generated with a Pure
    Y*.MAP         Pascal program and are nessesary for the
                   different plasmaeffects. The X*.MAP files
                   define the X-distortion and the X*.MAP files
                   the Y-distortion.
