releasing quite a few of these disks depending on time and demand, this
disk is mostly a compilation of basic routines and source code which has
been featured on our disk magazine (The Ledgers) over the last year.  If
you want details of getting hold of the magazine disks to read the
articles which were written to explain the various bits of code or if
you want to get any future source code disks then send a stamped addressed
envelope (or international reply coupons) to the following address :

  Mat of the Untouchables
  24 Kingsway West
  Penwortham 
  Preston
  Lancs
  PR1 OJA

  Any contributions to these disks or to the Ledgers Disk Magazines will
be gratefully recieved.  If you use any of this source code please credit 
the writer and the group they are in .. 

  This disk MAY be stocked in any PD Library - Make sure you dont/didn't
pay too much for it though .. Id rather you sent your money straight to
the people who write the software (us) !!

  If you find this disk useful then please send Three Pounds Sterling to
the above address to cover production costs, distribution, disks, etc. and
you will recieve the next source code disk free of charge upon its 
completion.


  Seeya soon, (and watch out for our forthcoming demo !)
