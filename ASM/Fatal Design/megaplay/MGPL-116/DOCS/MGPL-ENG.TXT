----------------------------------------------------

It is strictly forbidden to modify this program or use of some parts of it
without my agreement. The Replay Routines, are freeware and you can freely use
them in any public domain program to the condition that you mention where they
come from. It is forbidden to use them in a commercial product. Contact me if
you need them for such a project.

You don't have to remove files from the archive.
You must transmit it completely and gratis. Some PD organisms can take
copying fees and only for copying, as long as no benefit is made.

I authorise magazines to put this program on their cover disk to only condition
that they send me the corresponding number, which is not too much ask.


Shareware :
-----------

The MegaPlayer has now become a shareware program !

If you regularly use the MegaPlayer, you must send a modest contribution
You will then receive a registered version to your name and will benefit of
all the advantages it has on the unregistered release.

Try to make an effort, take an envelop, stamps, a 50FF, 15DM, œ5 or 10$ cheque
or a 50FF bank-note and send it to me.

The last updates of this program will be found on ftp.cnam.fr
But keep in mind that there will not be many updates before June 1996
because I must continue my studies and prepare for exams.
So get registered if you want to have a good version of the MegaPlayer.
You won't regret it. And think a little about me who works for more than
one year on this program !


Little Doc
----------

The MegaPlayer¿ lets you listen SoundTracker music modules composed with
digitalised instruments. It has a GEM interface and can run as an accessory
(rename it MGT-PLAY.ACC et place it in C:\ with the resource file)
It uses the DSP to procedure an 16 bits stereo sound at 49KHz withtout
slowing down your machine.
It supports several different formats with any number of voices :
	- .MOD	SoundTracker,ProTracker,NoiseTracker,StarTrekker (Amiga)
			Octalyser (ST-Falcon), FastTracker I (PC)
	- .669	Composer 669 (PC)
	- .OKT	Oktalyzer (Amiga)
	- .MTM	MultiTracker (PC)
	- .S3M	ScreamTracker 3.0 to 3.2 (PC)
	- .ULT	UltraTracker 1.4 to 1.6 (GUS on PC)  (Registered version only)
	- .DTM	Digital Tracker 2.04 (Falcon)        (Registered version only)
	- .XM	FastTracker II (PC)                  (Registered version only)
You can pack your modules with the following packers :
Atomik 3.5, Ice 2.4, SpeedPacker 3, Sentry 2.0
or PowerPacker 2.0 (Amiga)
Please don't use the NoisePacker, it DESTROYS your module by coding the
samples on 4 bits !!!

The MegaPlayer¿ is very simple to use. Its interface is that of a CD player.
Here is the detail for some options :

- click on the module name makes display the samples names every second.
click once again to stop it.

- 'Rep' is used to select the automatic restart mode of a module.
It should be disabled in order to cope with the List mode.

- 'Inf' shows you some information on the currently loaded module.

- 'Osc' displays the Oscilloscops window.

- 'SpA' displays the Spectrum Analyser window.
This option is not implemented in the unregistered version.

- 'Snd' allows you to access the Sound Control Window, to change the replay
frequency or several volume parameters.

- 'Cfg' is used to change so configuration parameters.

- 'List' allows you to access to the Modules List functions of the MegaPlayer¿.
In a way, they are equivalent to the programmation of a CD player.
When a module is finished, the MegaPlayer¿ plays the next one in the List.
(if the 'Rep' option is not enabled !)
Use the 'Add' option to add a module after the end of the list, or click on a
module and then use 'Insert' to insert a module just before the one you have
selected.
Use 'Remove' to remove the selected module from the list.
You can 'Save' this list to 'Load' it after or to play it automatically on
the accessory boot, just rename it MGT-PLAY.MPL and place it in C:\.
You can use the 'Merge' option to add a whole list to the current list.
Of course, the 'Clear' option clears the whole list.

When selecting modules, you can use wildcards (? and *) to specify a set of
files.
You can also select several modules if you use the Selectric¿ fileselector.

The MegaPlayer¿ (as program) automatically loads the modules or list passed
into the command line. This means you can install it as an GEM application
with parameters (.GTP) for the *.MOD, *.S3M, *.ULT..etc files.

The MegaPlayer¿ includes the drag'n'drop protocol, which means that under
MultiTos, you can drag GEM desktop icons for example, on the MegaPlayer¿
windows. If you drag one file on the main window, the module will be loaded
and played. If there are several files or if the only file is a list, then
all the modules will be aded to the list (List Window) or a new list will
be created and played (All other windows).
Available only in the registered version.

The MegaPlayer¿ includes the AV-protocol too. It is used by alternative
desktops like Thing,Ease or Gemini. It provides Drag'n'Drop without Multitos
and run-time command lines to be passed to currently running programs.
For example, if you install the MegaPlayer¿ as application for *.MOD files,
double-clicking on a module will load and play it without loading the player
once again if it is already in memory.
Available only in the registered version.
Another feature is to cycle ALL windows with the Control-W key.

The MegaPlayer¿ uses a special system to match to your language.
Dependently of the system language (set-up with the NVRAM by default or by
the new AES), it looks for the following Resource files :
MGPL-ENG, MGPL-FRA, MGPL-DEU, MGPL-ESP, MGPL-ITA, MGPL-SWE
I made the French & english Resource files. You can translate yourselft
a Resource file (Warning, don't modify the file's structure) and send it to me.
Antonio Lillo made the Spanish translation. Do like him. Don't forget this
little .TXT documention file.
I wait especially a german translation because there is a lot a Atari
computers there. (Mein Deutch ist nicht sehr gut..)


So, that's all for the MegaPlayer. Have fun with it !


GEM Interface on ATARI :
------------------------

I recommend you to use the Thing alternative desktop and Freedom fileselector.
Your machine takes really another dimension with these two programs.
Don't hesitate if you want to improove the comfort of your system. Alternative
desktops don't take a lot of memory because they can be removed from memory
before starting a program. As for Freedom, try it, it's really 

I recommend you to use the AES 4.1 too, you will have several advantages
with many applications, and in particular, the MegaPlayer (Inconified Oscillos
and Spectrum are really great !)
You just need to take the GEM.SYS file in your MULTITOS folder or in the
root directory, rename it GEM.PRG or AES41.PRG for example, and place it
at the of your AUTO folder (it must be the last executed program). The only
drawback is that it takes some memory.
You can also use the freeware program Winx.


Programmers :
-------------

You can use the MegaPlayer in you own GEM applications.
To detect its presence, just search the MGT-PLAY or MGPL-REG application with
Appl_Find. Then use the VA_START protocol with as line command, the name(s)
of the module(s) or the list to play. Specify the whole path.

I recommend you to recognize the AV Protocol in your applications each time
it is possible. It improoves really the conviviality of the system. You will
find a description of this protocol in the helps of ST-GUIDE and THING or
in the file VA-PROTO.H of Gemini.

	when they are on the right

	- If you select all the files of an directory with Selectric¿, the first
	file will be replaced by the last one which is then selected twice.

	- Freedom seems not to work with List Window. It should be compatible with
	Selectric¿ protocol but apparenlty it doesn't work.


The Future, in order of priority :
----------------------------------

	and panning envelops and more pratical volumes.

	Sound Control Panel for Filter, Trebles, Basses...
	Parameters for the Spectrum Analyzer.

	Inter-application communication protocol for remoting by a program
	which wants to use the MegaPlayer¿

	Loading of - Old Falcon DTM and GTK formats
	- OktaMED-PRO (Amiga), DMF (PC) and Farandole (PC) formats.
	- Old TCB Tracker (ST) and STM Scream-Tracker (PC) formats.
