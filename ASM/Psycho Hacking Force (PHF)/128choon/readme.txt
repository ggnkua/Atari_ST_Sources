       -O- 128 Byte  Choonage -O-

Some "shit to beat dis"  as they said in
the old skool. Theres no old skool flava
about me though..   nevertheless  I hope
some old  skoolers  will appreciate this
very little prod.  Its been several days
work of optimisation  -  hours  worth of
music in a 128byte executable, featuring
the following:

 *  Algorithmically   generated   melody
 *  New-skool   lead   instrument   with
     detuned SID effect!
 *  Heavy 187bpm jungle  rhythm with raw
     sounding kick and snare
 *  SNDH  port    (non-emulated   player
     suggested)
 *  Source code included

Greetings

Sticking my tongue out  in the direction
of Defjam and making a funny face :-P

And also waves to 505, Dma-Sc & Timbral.


Enjoy!
