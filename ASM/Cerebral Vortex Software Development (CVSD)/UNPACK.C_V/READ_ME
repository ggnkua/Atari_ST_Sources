Gfa beginners, in my gfa example i use inline instruction.
Inline is a special instruction who allowed you to reserve
memory space and give some options:


INLINE truc%,1024

will reserve 1024 bytes and the start adress is truc%

If you put cursor on inline  line and press help, a 'inline menu'
will be displayed, press help and click on load, select 'unpk_pc1.inl'.

That will load the 'unpk_pc1.inl' file into our 1024 bytes, if you
use the save.GFA option, the inline will be saved with, but if you use
the save .LST option, the inline file will be not saved with.


I'm not a gfa master, i there is an error, please contact me
