**********************************************q

As you can see this doc is the english one, so french users
you can use the french doc, but don't forget the french doc
is only a translation of this doc, learn english, it's more funny
that reading the french doc who is a little bit shitty !!!

A little note for the users of << ALYZEE 4.2 >>, the 4.2 version was
written by << Digital Power (D.P.) >>, this version by << GT Turbo >>,
it's not a joke, i have changed my pseudo, it's all !!!!! 

p<< Alyzee 4.4 : >>
------------------q

Before all, you must know that this program is a boot configurator,
it allows you to display a personnal message (with the normal boot,
i will explain you a little bit after) on the boot of your disk,
or allows you to burst out the BIIIIIIIP emitted by your ATARI
when you press any key, or to kill the automatic repetition, select
the boot frequency (50, 60 Hz) or some new features becoz now
<< ALYZEE 4.4 >> got a B(oot) M(odul) S(ystem). This B.M.S. allows
the loading and the use of Boot Moduls that you can write yourself
or you can find in the Public Domain or in writing to C.V.S.D.

p<< HISTORY : >>
---------------q

The very first version of << ALYZEE >> i write, was to kill the Key
Beep, coz when i code, it's more easy to think when no BIIIIPPPP,
(It's really stressing !!!) interrupting you during your thinking !!!

Each version released have got at least one option of more than the
previous version, the version 4.2 got a GEM INTERFACE, and now this
version got a Formatting Option, the B.M.S. I hope that the B.M.S. will
make you happy, coz << ALYZEE >> is 100 % written in 68000 and now
the File Source will do something like 5000 lines. I don't want to
write in C or Pascal becoz i think that an accessory is a little program
and don't need a length of 200 Kilobytes like some Public Domain, coz
i got only one meg of ram and when you use 4 accessory of 200 Kb, i will
let you calcul how many of Kb i can use to code !!!!!

p<< Little things to know : >>
-----------------------------q

You can use << Alyzee >> as an accessory or an normal programme,
just rename ALYZEE44.PRG in ALYZEE44.ACC to use like an accessory.
Alyzee support WINX bottom command (Window).
Each option got a letter between brackets, it's the shortcut key, to
use it press Control+Letter between brackets.
You can also use CONTROL+, CONTROL+, in the editable field, to
go to the start or the beginning of the field.

p<< OPTIONS OF ALYZEE 4.4 : >>
-----------------------------q

On the left of the main window formular, you can see :

- Beep Keyboard : I will let you guess what we can do with it !!
- Repeat Keyboard : Same thing !!
- Frequency : Same thing !!
- Drive : Same thing, no it's to select the drive where << ALYZEE >>
          must put is boot, or the disk drive to format.
- Sector : To select the sector format.
- Sides : Number of sides to be formatted.

- Two editables field : write in this two lines, your personnal message
                        who will be display each time you boot with this
                        disk. TAKE NOTE OF THAT !!! This two lines run
                        without problems with the << ORIGINAL BOOT >>
                        and it's all, i can garanty that the futur or
                        some boot will use this lines !!!! Coz the B.M.S.
                        allowed you to don't use it if you want !!!

- One editable field : the disk name, only when you format a disk.

- The B(oot).M(odul).L(ist) : This is the list of the loaded moduls.
                              and the selected boot who will be putted
        	              if you format or put the boot. If you
        	              want to change de Boot Modul, just click
	              on the liked Boot Modul.
	
- After some options like :

- Info : Try by yourself !!!
- Exit : Guess, guess !!!
- Format : What can do this cool option ????
           (When you format a disk, << ALYZEE >> will automatically
           put the selected boot on this disk.)
- Pt Boot : Put the selected boot on the selected drive !!!
- Ld Boot : Load a Boot Modul. (You can't load a B.M. on the first
            modul, coz this one is integrated to << ALYZEE >> )

- Se BML : Save the B(oot) M(odul) L(ist) and at the next use of
           << ALYZEE >>. << ALYZEE >> load all the boots who were in the
           B.M.L. during this save. WARNING !!! The boot modul must be
           in the disk root or else << ALYZEE >> can't be able to load
           them. (Perhaps in the next version !!!). WARNING TOO !!!
           Don't change the name, << ALYZEE >> save the B.M.L. in itself,
           so if you change the name << ALYZEE >> don't be able to save
           the B.M.L.

p<< THE BOOT MODUL FORMAT, FOR CODERS : >>
-----------------------------------------q

In the next lines, i give you the B(oot).M(odul).F(ormat). I give you
all things to do your personnal boot, if you don't find your dreamed boot.

	- yo must write your boot in relatif-PC and the module too,
	coz << Alyzee >> don't relocate Boot Modul and your ATARI
	or compatible ATARI don't relocate the boot.

I)   The Boot Modul must begin with that :" CVSD1995ALYZEE44"
     else << ALYZEE >> won't load your boot. (16 Bytes)
II)  After that, you have 32 Bytes free to write the Boot Name or
     the Author or the two things, these 32 bytes are displayed
     in the B(oot) M(odul) L(ist).
III) A word flag, the first bit select or not if you want the Beep
     That means if it was set to 0, << ALYZEE >> forget this option.
     Same thing for the other bits, but this time :
     
     - The bit 1 : Automatic Keyboard Repeat
     - The bit 2 : Frequency
     - The bit 3 : First line of text
     - The bit 4 : Second line of text

For the two lines of text, the maximum is 28 bytes length per line.

After that, you have a word that indicates the offset from the boot to
your instruction to kill the keyboard beep and the automatic repeat,
to understand that correctly please throw a eye in the next lines !!!
If you don't want this option, you have to set them to zero.
The next offset for the frequency option. After the text offset for
the two lines, if you don't use it, same thing as previous.
The next word is the boot length, note that your boot don't be bigger
than 484 bytes. To modify the beep or the repeat, << ALYZEE >> modify
the bit 0 of your instruction for the beep and the bit 1 for the
repeat automatic. For the frequency, << ALYZEE >> modify the bit 1
so i think you have just to use :

	move.b	#$7,$484.w
	move.b	#$2,$ffff820a.w

for this option.	

So the boot modul exemple :
     
	dc.b	"CVSD1995"	* Never Forget else
	dc.b	"ALYZEE44"	* Alyzee will never
			* load your boot !!!

		* Name of your module (32 Bytes)
	
	dc.b	"<< The Exemple Boot ,  Alyzee >>"	

	dc.w	%11111	* Flag Word
		* Bit 0 : Beep Keyboard Flag
		* Bit 1 : Repeat Keyboard Flag
		* Bit 2 : Frequency Flag
		* Bit 3 : First Line Txt
		* Bit 4 : Second Line Txt

	dc.w	3	* Beep Keyboard Offset
			* That means Boot+3 Byte

	dc.w	9	* Frequency Offset
			* Boot+9
	
	
	* First Line txt Offset
	* if i have added two it's for writing after the * and to
	* let a space.

	dc.w	First_line-Boot+2

	
	dc.w	Scond_line-Boot+2
	
	* Second Line txt Offset
	* same thing like the previous line


	dc.w	Boot_end-Boot	* Boot Length

Boot:	move.b	#$7,$484.w	* Offset of 3, << ALYZEE >>
			* will modify the 7.

	move.b	#$2,$ffff820a.w	* Offset of 9, << ALYZEE >>
			* will modify the 2.

	pea	GT_text(pc)	* My beautiful message.
	move.w	#9,-(a7)
	trap	#1
	addq.w	#6,a7

	rts		* DON'T FORGET THE RTS !!!

GT_text:	dc.b	27,"p"
	dc.b	"********************************",13,10
First_line:	dc.b	"*                              *",13,10
Scond_line:	dc.b	"*                              *",13,10
	dc.b	"********************************",13,10
	dc.b	27,"q",0
	EVEN
Boot_end:

	
I hope you have understood (ARGHHH !!!!), perhaps a little bit complex,
anyway if you want to code your boot and you are lost in the previous
lines, write to me. (Adress at the end of this doc.)

p<< ALYZEE : FREEWARE, SHAREWARE, EVERYTHINGWARE ??? : >>
--------------------------------------------------------q

Normaly, << ALYZEE >> is an everythingware, that means you like it,
send everything (Money, Postal Card, Public Domain, Chocolates, Candys,
really everything except your grand-mother !!!) but if you write Boot
Modul, send me them or it, yes it's all for Boot Modul Writters, just
send me your boot(s). I want to do a Boot Modul Compil Disk, so please
send me your Boot, if you do it, i send you the Boot Modul Compil.
I find people who want to swap Public Domain ,only, no illegal programs,
everywhere in the universe, so if you got a long public domain list,
please send your list, i will send my list and let's go for public domain
swapping or why not 68000 codes swapping (all kind of code : GEM code,
GAME code, STE code, DEMO code, all !!) if you swap Public Domain with me,
i will send you the last Public Domain of C.V.S.D. and you don't have to
send us something for the use of << ALYZEE >> or one of the C.V.S.D.
programs. Don't hesitate if you find a bug or even a big bug. With this
version of << ALYZEE >> you will find two Boot moduls, The virus are
dead Modul it runs on all ATARI (I hope !) and the CV low rz who only
run in ST LOW RESOLUTION.
