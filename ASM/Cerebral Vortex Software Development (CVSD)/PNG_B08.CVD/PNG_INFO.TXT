* The Cerebral Vortex Software Team is happy to give you    *
* this PNG rout, fully written in asm (68000), it isn't     *
* the fastest one, but surely the smallest one (Less than   *
* 5 Kbytes). It read all PNG formats, 1,2,4,8,16,32 bits    *
* by pixel, interlaced or not, with Alpha or not, etc...    *
*                                                           *
* It was a pain in the ass for coding it, but now it run.   *
* It was coded on a CTPCIed Falcon, under Devpac.           *
* There are only one bug left (I wanted to say that i found)*
* in 1,4,8 bits by pixel interlaced picture with odd size   *
* the result is a 'sinus shifted picture'. Debugged (I hope)*
* in the next version.                                      *
*                                                           *
* Some details in the source, all questions can be sent to :*
* png68000@jagware.org or you surely can found a topic on   *
* Dbug forums.                                              *
*                                                           *
* The Beta PRG done in it's package allow you to select     *
* a PNG file and display it. This little PRG was only       *
* written for displaying the pic on a RADEON card, too lazy *
* for a proper display on stock T.C. Falcon, it's not very  *
* difficult, see into the sources.                          *
*                                                           *
* Hope this rout will be spreaded to all 68000 users :)     *
