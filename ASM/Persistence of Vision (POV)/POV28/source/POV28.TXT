WELCOME TO P.O.V. 28         MENU CODED BY MAC SYS DATA, ART BY OZ, 
MUSIC FROM IRONLORD (ZIPPY OF THE MEDWAY BOYS SEZ IT WAS WRITTEN BY MAD 
MAX).     ON THIS DISC IS MORE 1 MEG STUFF - I NOW ONLY HAVE THREE 1 MEG ONLY 
DEMOS TO GET RID OF.    PLEASE LISTEN TO ALL OF THE TUNE AS IT'S GREAT AND 
WILL INFECT YOUR BRAIN (I KEEP FINDING MYSELF WHISTLING IT AT WORK).      
THE NEXT PIECE OF TEXT WAS IN MY ORIGINAL TEST TEXT AND WAS WRITTEN ON 
31-7-90 -------- HELLO I'VE JUST BEEN TO SEE 'BACK TO THE FUTURE 3' WITH 
ALY AND BORIS.   IT WAS BRILLIANT!    AFTER THE FILM WE ALL WENT TO A PUB 
BEFORE GOING HOME IN MY ASTRA.   I THRASHED THE CAR ON THE WAY BACK AND 
MANAGED 92 MPH (IT'S ONLY A 1.2 LITRE) BUT WE STILL DIDN'T GO   FLASH,  
CRACKLE,  FIZZZZ,  BOOOOOMMMMMM!!!       THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN I 
SAW 'BACK TO THE FUTURE PART 1', I RODE HOME (ON MY MOTORCYCLE) AT 97 MPH 
WITH MY BROTHER ON THE BACK.  HE WAS RATHER UNIMPRESSED AS IT WAS VERY 
FOGGY AND WE COULDN'T SEE WHERE WE WERE GOING!    TOMORROW NIGHT BORIS 
AND I ARE GOING TO SEE 'GREMLINS 2' SO I'LL GIVE MY OPINION OF IT LATER 
IN THIS TEXT.    WELL I'VE JUST COPIED THE LATEST VERSION OF GENST2 (
VERSION 2.21) FROM BORIS AND THE TIME IS 23:47.  I AM RATHER SLEEPY AND 
SO I THINK I'LL CALL IT A NIGHT, SO UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT.... BYE!         
             HELLOOOOOO, WELL I'VE NOW SEEN 'GREMLINS 2' AND IT WAS OK. 
IN FACT IT WAS BRILLIANT, YOU MUST GO AND WATCH IT!       ---------     
WELL ENOUGH OF THE 'TEST TEXT', HERE'S THE REAL TEXT........  LAST 
NIGHT I WENT TO SEE 'TOTAL RECALL' AND IT WAS THE BEST FILM I'VE SEEN FOR 
AGES. I THINK IT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN BTTF 3 AND GREMLINS 2 PROBABLY 
BECAUSE IT WAS MORE VIOLENT - YEH!         HERE'S A QUESTION TO 'THE LOST 
BOYS' - ARE YOU THE SAME CREW AS THE ONE ON THE AMIGA?         IF YOU ARE 
THEN WHY DID MAHONEY AND KAKTUS GREET YOU ON THEIR 'SOUNDS OF GNOME' 
SOUND DISC? (OTHERWISE KNOWN AS 'MAHONEY AND KAKTUS MUSIC DISC 2').        
NOW HERE'S A GENERAL QUESTION - WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY MENUS?  I KNOW 
THIS ONE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT 'COS I HAVE THINGS MOVING BUT WHAT DO 
YOU THINK OF THEM IN GENERAL?        THE REASON I ASK IS THAT A CERTAIN TWO 
MEMBERS OF P.O.V. HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THERE IS NOTHING MOVING APART FROM 
THE SCROLLINE AND THAT THEY LOOK TOO SIMILAR TO OTHER PEOPLES MENUS.     
   NOW I COULD SPEND A LOT OF TIME MAKING THE MENUS HAVE BOBS AND OTHER 
THINGS WHIZZING AROUND THE SCREEN AND HAVE A MASSIVE SCROLLER AND MILLIONS 
OF COLOURS ALL AT ONCE BUT WHY SHOULD I BOTHER WHEN YOU'RE ONLY INTERESTED 
IN THE DEMOS ON THE DISC?      IF THE TWO MEMBERS CONCERNED CONTINUE TO MOAN 
I'M GOING TO STOP WRITING MENUS AND ONLY HACK 'N' PACK THE STUFF.  I'M SURE 
IF I STOPPED P.O.V. WOULD STILL BE DOING DISC 29 IN 6 MONTHS.   WITH THE SPARE 
TIME I GOT FROM NOT CODING, I COULD START PACKING GAMES OR MAYBE LEAVE THE ST 
AND CONCENTRATE ON MY AMIGA.  ONE LAST COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT, HAVE A LOOK 
BACK THROUGH ALL YOUR P.O.V. DISCS AND COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE NAMES 
BORIS AND ALY APPEAR ON THE CREDITS FOR THE MENUS.         WELL?     NOT MANY 
IS IT?    IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DO ALL THE WORK AND STILL GET SLAGGED OFF, THE 
SOLUTION IS FOR OZ AND I TO QUIT P.O.V. AND FORM A NEW CREW AND LEAVE BORIS AND 
ALY TO STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP THE PRESENT OUTPUT OF DISCS.    IF WE DID, I BET THE 
NAME P.O.V. WOULD SINK WITHIN SIX MONTHS....        RIGHT, I'M GLAD I GOT THAT 
OFF MY CHEST, NOW FOR THE GREETINGS TO... "
