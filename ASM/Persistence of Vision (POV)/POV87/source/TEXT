          TODAY I FINALLY LOST MY TEMPER WITH MY PHILIPS CM8833 MONITOR
 AND RIPPED IT APART BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT STARTS
 MAKING CLICKING NOISES FROM THE RIGHT HAND SPEAKER.    IF YOU HIT THE THING
 OR PRESS THE BACK IT STOPS AND WILL BE OKAY FOR A WHILE.    THE FAULT
 WAS OBVIOUSLY A BAD JOINT ON THE BOARD SOMEWHERE AND I'VE HAD IT
 IN BITS ABOUT 3 TIMES BEFORE AND COULD NEVER FIND OUT WHERE THE FAULT
 WAS.     WELL TODAY, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU HIT IT THE SOUND WOULD
 NOT GO AWAY.  OH YEH, WHEN THE SPEAKER WAS MAKING A CLICKING SOUND
 THE OTHER SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING SO I HAD A NOISELESS STE.   GETTING
 BACK TO THE POINT, I PULLED THE THING APART AND WHILST IT WAS PLUGGED
 IN (DON'T TRY THIS YOURSELF) I WAGGLED THE BOARDS AROUND.     THE SOUND
 KEPT CRACKING AND POPING BUT AFTER A QUICK LOOK AT THE CIRCUIT
 DIAGRAM I FIGURED OUT THAT IT MUST BE THE RIGHT HAND AMP CHIP.    I
 IDENTIFIED THE THING AND TOUCHED IT WITH A SCREWDRIVER.......
     POP,  CRACKLE,  BANG!,   BUZZZ....... SILENCE............
       I TOUCHED IT AGAIN AND GOT THE SAME SEQUENCE.  THE CLICKING HAD
 STOPPED, SO I PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AND PLUGGED MY STE BACK IN.
    TURN ON....     CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK    TURN
 OFF,   PULL APART.     RIGHT, THIS MEANS WAR!!!!      WHILST I WAS LOOKING
 FOR THE NEXT MUG THAT WALKED PAST TO WHOM I COULD SELL IT, I NOTICED
 THAT THE HEAT SINKS ON THE STEREO CHIPS PROTRUDED FURTHER OUT THAN THE
 SCART CONNECTOR.    I LOOKED IN THE CASE AND THERE WAS A TELL TALE BURN
 MARK.    IT WAS OBVIOUS, WHILST I HAD THE BACK OFF THERE
 WAS NO STRESS ON THE CHIP BUT AS SOON AS I PUT THE BACK OF THE MONITOR
 ON, THE CHIP WAS BEING PUSHED FORWARD.    AFTER FIGHTING WITH THE POWER
 SUPPLY FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES I MANAGED TO REMOVE IT AND THUS GOT
 A BETTER VIEW OF THE BACK OF THE SOUND BOARD.    I LOOKED
 FOR A DRY JOINT ON THE LEGS BUT THEY LOOKED OKAY. TO BE SURE I THOUGHT I'D
 GIVE THEM A QUICK TOUCH WITH A SOLDERING IRON....     THE TOP THREE
 PINS WHERE ALRIGHT, HOWEVER THE REST OF THEM HAD A SMALL LINE ROUND
 THEM HALF WAY DOWN THE LEGS.      EUREKA!     I HAD FOUND THE PROBLEM, THE PRESSURE
 ON THE HEAT SINK HAD BROKEN THE SOLDER JOINTS TO ABOUT 5 PINS.  I
 SOLDERED THE LEGS BACK TO THE PCB AND PUT THE MONITOR BACK TOGETHER
 IN WORLD RECORD TIME.     ONCE ASSEMBLED, I PLUGGED MY STE IN AND TURNED
 ON........     WAS THERE A CLICK?        WAS THERE A BUZZ?,       
 WAS THERE GOING TO BE A BRICK THROUGH MY MONITOR TUBE?           
    NO!      I HAD FIXED IT.      SO IF YOUR CM8833 STARTS
 CLICKING FROM ONE SPEAKER THEN IT'LL PROBABLY BE THE SAME FAULT.
     I MUST STRESS THAT IF YOU ARE NOT ELECTRICALLY MINDED THEN
 DO NOT PULL YOUR MONITOR APART BECAUSE THE TUBE IS VERY CAPACITIVE
 AND CAN HOLD UPTO 22,000 VOLTS EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE UNPLUGGED IT
 FROM THE MAINS.    I AM A TIME SERVED, FULLY QUALIFIED INSTRUMENT
 MECHANIC AND AM USED TO DELVING IN THE BACK OF EQUIPMENT WHILST
 IT IS 'LIVE'...           RIGHT FANS, HAVE YOU ALL GOT
 ST-FORMAT ISSUE 26 (SEPT '91)?         IF YOU HAVE THEN
 TURN TO PAGE 47.       YES ST-FORMAT HAS DONE US PROUD AND
 REVIEWED 3 OF OUR DISCS (P.O.V. 50, 70 AND A SOUNDTRACKER DISC).
    ONE MOAN IS THAT THEY DON'T MENTION ALL THE TITLES ON THE DISCS,
 THIS MAYBE BECAUSE THEY ARE GIVEN DODGY COPIES WHO KNOWS?
