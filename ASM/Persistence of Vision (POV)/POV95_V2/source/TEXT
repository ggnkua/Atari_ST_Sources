          WE HAVE NOW RELEASED 95 DEMO COMPILATION
 DISCS AND WE'RE GOING STRONGER THAN EVER. I HAVE TO ADMIT,
 THOUGH, THAT MAC SYS DATA HAS DONE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK
 AND WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL THAT HE HAS KEPT GOING WITHOUT MUCH
 SUPPORT, AT TIMES, FROM THE REST OF US. AS I HAVE NOW
 FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY AND STARTED A JOB, I HAVE BEEN ABLE
 TO CODE MUCH MORE STUFF - THIS EXPLAINS WHY A LOT OF THE
 RECENT p MENUS ARE BY ME! I HOPE YOU LIKE THEM BECAUSE
 I HAVE QUITE A FEW MORE IDEAS FOR MENUS IN THE FUTURE.
     I'LL HAND THE CONTROLS OVER TO MAC SYS DATA NOW SEEING
 AS HE'S PUTTING THE DISC TOGETHER...
              HELLO ALL (M.S.D. AT THE HELM), WELL THIS DISC IS BEING THROWN TOGETHER AS
 I HAVE NOT RELEASED A DISC FOR QUITE A WHILE.         SINCE THE
 LAST MENU I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TRACK DOWN SOME DEMOS AS OUR SUPPLIER
 HAS LET US DOWN AND AS A RESULT I HAVE HAD NO NEW DEMOS FOR 4 MONTHS.
         I MUST THANK 'STEVE DAVIS' (YES THAT'S AN ALIAS!) FOR THE
 FEW DISCS HE HAS SUPPLIED LATELY, AS A RESULT WE ARE NOW USING ICE PACK 2.40
 AND HE IS USING P.O.V. MENU CODE.            
   RIGHT, QUESTION TIME.....      DO YOU COLLECT DEMOS?         
 DO YOU HAVE GOOD CONTACTS?         
 DO YOU GET ALL THE NEW STUFF AS SOON AS IT HAS BEEN RELEASED?         
 DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPARE TIME?         
 IF THE ANSWER TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS IS YES, THEN WE WANT TO HEAR FROM
 YOU.      WE ARE NOW FED UP WITH CRAP PD LIBRARIES THAT LET US DOWN WHEN
 WE ASK FOR DEMOS SO WE ARE GOING 'PUBLIC'.    MORE DETAILS OF OUR
 INTENTIONS WILL BE RELEASED AFTER XMAS BUT BASICALLY THERE IS GOING TO
 BE QUITE A FEW UPSET PD LIBRARIES.   IF YOU HAVE KEPT GOOD CONTACTS
 WITH P.O.V. THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT BUT IF YOU
 OWE US MONEY OR DISCS THEN BE WARNED, MESS WITH P.O.V. AND YOU WILL
 PAY THE CONSEQUENCE....... MORE DETAILS IN THE NEW YEAR.      
   I WOULD LIKE TO THANK FRIENDS OF MANI FROM NORTHSIDE
 WHO HAVE SUPPLIED US VIA HIM WITH DEMOS, I HOPE MY WORK AND MENUS
 FOR NORTHSIDE ARE APPRECIATED. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK DEL AT D.W. STABLES
 FOR THE SMALL SUPPLY HE HAS MADE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT GIVING US.      
    IF ANY PD LIBRARIES HAVE NEW DEMOS, PLEASE SEND THEM TO ME (MAC SYS DATA)
 AT THE REGULAR ADDRESS.            IF YOU ARE A NEW PD LIBRARY OR SIMPLY
 WANT TO WRITE TO P.O.V. THEN ADDRESS
