HELLO   PLEASE ENJOY THIS SLIDESHOW OF MY WORK, TREAT IT AS ART OR TREAT IT AS AN ADVERT...WHATEVER. LOAD ON AN ATARI ST OR STE WITH 1 MEG OR MORE.
   I AM CURRENTLY IN THE FINAL FEW MONTHS OF A BTEC NATIONAL DIPLOMA IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, AND FINISH IN JUNE 92. I AM LOOKING FOR PAID WORK EITHER FREELANCE FROM MY
 HOME OR WORKING IN HOUSE IN THE NORTH. I HAVE OVER THREE YEARS EXPERIENCE IN GRAPHICS ON THE ATARI ST AND ON THE MACINTOSH. I HAVE MUCH EXPERINCE IN FULL
 COLOUR DESKTOP PUBLISHING ON THE MAC AND ANIMATION ON THE ATARI. ADVERT OVER...   WIERD STUFF NOW....   I CREATE MY ATARI ARTWORK USING CYBER PAINT V2 AND
 FIND IT INVALUABLE IN CREATING THE TEXTURES AND EFFECTS YOU CAN SEE. AFTER MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH MANY ART PACKAGES, I FIND THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. THE 
AMIGA IS VASTLY OVERRATED, SLOW AND PRONE TO CRASHING. THE MAC IS FAST BUT THE WIMP SYSTEM MAKES ACCESS SEEM DISTANT AND TAILORED TO A PREDEFINED RESULT. 
  THANKS FOR LOOKING AT THIS DEMO. IT IS PUBLIC DOMAIN SO DISTRIBUTE FREELY, BUT ALL ARTWORK IS COPYRIGHT 1990,91,92 PERSISTENCE OF VISION AND NO ARTWORK OR THE
 MUSIC MUST BE REMOVED WITHOUT MY CONSENT. THANKS.... BYE....       WRAP
