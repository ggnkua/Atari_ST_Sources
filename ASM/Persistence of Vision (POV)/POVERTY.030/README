POVERTY
-------

Hi, this demo was created for the STE then ported to the Falcon 'cos
I was moving house and the Falcon was the only Atari computer I had
not packed away.

The demo is a simple slideshow using a virtual screen 3 wide by 3 deep.
The pictures are only 16 colours but the end part is in 256 colours
unfortunately I only use about 34 of them!


BUGS
----

Yes there are some.. the end part has some flicker in the rasters. The
bug was not present in the boot sector loading version so it must be
something to do with the hard disc controller interfereing with the
serial omni-bidirection whipple nut hitting the flange of the steam
powered coconut tree - as you can see I don't know why!!!!!!

The other bug is that it doesn't reset the colour correctly when in
a falcon video mode - dunno why not.





This version has been filed so it is easier to spread over the internet.
