EbpInstructions - How to Playq

Incase You have never played Galaxian :

Destroy waves of attacking Galaxians by
moving left and right and firing.  The
Galaxians will sit in formation above
you, and you can pick them off with 
your Cannon.  Beware - You can only
fire one shot at a time.  Your next 
bullet will not reappear until your last
one has disappeared.  Also, the 
Galaxians become more and more 
aggressive as the waves proceed.  They 
will break formation and swoop down on 
you as they attack.

Scoring :

Colour    In formation      Attacking
---------------------------------------
Green        30 pts          60 pts
Purple       40 pts          80 pts
Red          50 pts         100 pts
Yellow       60 pts         120 pts

If a Galaxian is killed while attacking
his score is doubled.  The only 
exception is when a yellow flagship
breaks formation and attacks with two
Red Escort ships.  If the Escorts are
killed and then the flagship (in that
order), then you will score 800 pts. If
only one Escort is killed, you will only
score 200 pts.

Extra Lives are gained every 7000 pts.

The Main Menu can either be controlled
by either Joystick, the function keys, 
or the currently defined left and right
keys.

F1/F2 - From the main menu, you can 
start either 1 or 2 player games.

F3    - Allows the user to redefine
the keyboard layout, incase the
default one is not to his/her liking.

F4    - Options Menu
      F1 - Select Joystick 0/1 or
           keyboard for use in the game
           for player 1.
           Remember that Joystick 0 is
           the mouse port.
      F2 - Select Joystick 0/1 or
           keyboard for use in the game
           for player 1.
           Remember that Joystick 0 is
           the mouse port.
      F3 - Select difficulty level. With
           the upper two levels, the 
           game enables an option called
           "formation bombing".  This
           allows the Galaxians to bomb
           while still in formation.
      F4 - Select the number of lives 
           that you begin with. Goes from
           3 to 9.

      F5 - Allows the user to enable
           Overscan.  This effectively
           removes the bottom border of 
           the screen, making the screen
           aspect closer to the arcade
           original.  NOTE - THIS WILL 
           NOT WORK ON TT's and ST's
           with accelerator boards.
      F6 - This allows techie types to
           see how much processor time
           the game is consuming at any
           one moment.
      F7 - Enable and Disable the Sound
           FX.  This may be desireable
           for people who don't
           absolutely love the YM chip !
      F9 - Save the current setup of all
           of the above options (except
           the high score table).  This
           also saves the redefined keys
           too.
      F10- Return to the main menu.
p---- Press Space ----qb

F5    - Save the high score table.  Just
	ensure that there is a write
	enable disk in the drive.
	
F6    - Demo mode.  Not for the sqeemish

F10   - Return to GEM Desktop




Notice for Hard Disk Users :

The game will quite happily run off of
Hard Disk.  Just stick the program in
a folder, and run it.  For those
people who have really fast hard Disks
and are not worried about space, then
you can depack the game with one of the
myriad of depackers available in the
public domain. (We recommend Mega-Depack
'cause we wrote it !).
