         HELLO PEOPLE, MAC SYS DATA BACK AFTER A LONG BREAK.
    THE REASON FOR THE DELAYED RELEASE WAS THAT I HAVE BEEN
 WORKING AWAY FROM HOME AND THUS NOT DOING THESE COMPILATIONS.
      ANYWAY, I SEE THAT THE USUAL CHRISTMAS RUSH OF DEMOS HAS
 STARTED WITH MANY CREWS RELEASING A MEGADEMO FOR THE START OF WINTER.
 I SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIP MOST MUSIC OUT OF THEM SO THEY WILL APPEAR SOONISH.       
 YOU MAY HAVE HEARD RUMOURS THAT WE ARE GIVING UP, WELL TO PUT THE
 RECORD STRAIGHT WE ARE.      P.O.V. IS TO DISAPPEAR FOR A WHILE AFTER THIS DISC
      ALL MEMBERS AT P.O.V. ARE NOW WORKING ON OTHER PROJECTS
 WHICH KEEPS US VERY BUSY.    HOWEVER YOU SHOULD SEE OUR WORK APPEAR
 ON OTHER CREWS DISCS BUT THE P.O.V. OF OLD IS
 DEAD.        AS THIS IS OUR LAST DISC FOR A LONG TIME
 I SHALL DO A LARGER THAN USUAL GREETINGS LIST.    WE AT P.O.V. HAVE
 ONLY A FEW CONTACTS SO MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE GREET WE DO NOT
 ACTUALLY KNOW.      FIRST SPECIAL GREETINGS TO
