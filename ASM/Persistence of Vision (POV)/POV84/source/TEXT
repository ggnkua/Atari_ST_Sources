                                                       
WELCOME TO P.O.V. DISC 84.     RELEASE DATE 24-07-91.
          CODING AND BALLS BY BORIS.
     PICTURE AND FONT BY OZYMANDIAS.
     MUSIC RIPPED FROM AWESOME AND SCROLL TEXT WRITTEN BY MAC SYS DATA.
          ANOTHER DAY AND ANOTHER MENU BURSTS FORTH FROM
 BORIS' ST!                    
 P.O.V. IS MADE UP OF THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS...       
 MAC SYS DATA (ME),     BORIS     AND     OZYMANDIAS.      
 TOGETHER WE CREATE THESE PACKED PD COMPILATION DISCS.
      I MUST POINT OUT THAT WE CODE THE MENUS ONLY, WE DO NOT
 CREATE THE DEMOS ON THE DISCS UNLESS WHERE STATED AND THEREFORE CANNOT
 BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THE DEMOS DO NOT WORK.      HOWEVER, IF
 A DEMO DOES NOT WORK ON YOUR ST AND IT SHOULD (TEST THIS BY GETTING
 THE ORIGINAL UNPACKED VERSION) THEN WE WANT TO KNOW SO WE CAN FIX IT.     THERE
 HAS BEEN A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH TOS 1.62 AND DEMOS NOT WORKING, WHEN
 THE FAULTS HAVE BEEN TRACED IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE DEMOS AT FAULT AND
 NOT THE MENU OR PACK.     IF YOU HAVE A NEW STE WITH
 TOS 1.62 AND A DEMO DOES NOT WORK THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO SEND US
 YOUR MACHINE AND THE OFFENDING DISC AS WE HAVE NO ACCESS TO A NEW STE.
        I MUST POINT OUT THAT WE CAN NOT RETURN ANY MACHINES SEND TO US SO BASICALLY
 IF IT DOESN'T WORK TOUGH SHIT DICK-BRAIN!!!
