            I WANNA TELL YOU A STORY.....
         JENNY (MY GIRLFRIEND) AND I WENT OUT LAST NIGHT.      WE 
WENT TO A LOCAL BAR FOR A DRINK, THE BAR WAS GETTING RATHER FULL AND 
THERE WAS NO PINBALL MACHINE SO WE LEFT TO VISIT ANOTHER BAR.
      THE PINBALL WAS BEING PLAYED BY A COUPLE OF BLOKES WE WENT INTO 
THE POOL ROOM TO WAIT.      WE STARTED PLAYING POOL AND JENNY PUT HER 
PURSE WITH ALL HER MONEY IN IT ON THE RADIATOR.    THE POOL ROOM HAS 
ONLY ONE DOOR AND THERE WAS ONLY US IN THERE.      WE WERE PLAYING POOL 
WHEN A GIRL WALKED FROM THE PINBALL INTO A CORNER IN THE POOL ROOM TO 
PICK UP 2 COATS. SHE WENT BEHIND US AND PASSED THE RADIATOR, SHE PICKED
 HER COAT UP AND WALKED BACK TO THE PINBALL AREA.     A COUPLE OF 
MINUTES LATER I SAT ON THE RADIATOR BUT DIDN'T NOTICE THE MISSING PURSE.
   A FEW MINUTES LATER JENNY ASKED WHERE HER PURSE WAS, I SAID I DIDN'T
 KNOW AND WE LOOK ALL ROUND FOR IT.      THE GIRL WHO WALKED PAST US
 WAS STILL IN THE BAR AND SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO GO INTO THE POOL
 ROOM SO WE ASKED HER IF SHE HAD SEEN IT, SHE SAID SHE HADN'T.
       WE ASKED THE BAR MANAGER IF ANYONE HAD HANDED A PURSE IN BUT
 HE SAID NO.   WE LEFT THE BAR AND WENT TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION TO
 REPORT IT STOLEN AND EXPLAINED WE SAY WHO TOOK IT.    THE POLICE SAID 
WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BAR AND LOOK IN THE TOILETS AS THINGS ARE OFTEN
 DUMPED THERE.    WE WENT BACK BUT IT WASN'T THERE.     THE THIEF WAS
 STILL IN THE BAR, JENNY WANTED TO GO ACROSS AND THUMP HER BUT I TALKED
 HER OUT OF IT.  WHEN THE BAR SHUT WE LEFT AND CAME HOME.  THE PURSE
 CONTAINED 60 POUNDS STERLING AND 2 CHEQUES FOR 10 POUNDS.         
TODAY WE WENT INTO BLACKPOOL (THE LOCAL TOWN) AND BOUGHT A NEW PURSE, THE
 POLICE SAID THEY WILL CALL IF THE OLD ONE IS HANDED IN.
       THE BAR MANAGER SAID HE KNEW THINGS WERE STOLEN AND WHO WAS DOING
 IT BUT HE COULDN'T CATCH THEM.    WE THINK THE GIRL PASSED THE PURSE ONTO SOME
 BLOKES. THE BLOKES LEFT THE BAR A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE PURSE WENT MISSING THEN
 RETURNED ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER.    NEXT TIME WE GO OUT JENNY WILL ENSURE THAT
 SHE KEEPS HER PURSE IN HER POCKETS BUT WE STILL INTEND TO CATCH THE GIRL WHO
 STOLE IT AND WHEN WE DO SHE WILL GET A GOOD BEATING.
