                          HELLO, ANYONE THERE?
             THIS IS ONE OF THE 'NOT SO GOOD' POV DISCS AS I HAVE USED
 SOME STUFF I PACKED YEARS AGO. THE DEMOS ARE OK BUT A LITTLE DATED 
COMPARED TO THE NEW STANDARDS SET ON THE PC AND FALCON.
      THE INVITATION DEMO ON HERE IS AN OLD ONE SO DO NOT WRITE TO THE
 ADDRESSES AND EXPECT A RESULT.
          HERE ARE THE GREETS, HI TO.....
        D-BUG (NICE TO SEE YOU ON PC),     POMPEY PIRATES (NICE WEB SITE),
    ALL ON C.I.X (WWW.CIX.NET)    MARK W. (DRAVEN)    AND ALL OTHERS I KNOW I HAVE FORGOTTEN.
          THIS DISC IS 80 TRACK, 10 SECTORS FORMAT.
      SEEING THERE ARE NO WIDE SPREAD ATARI MAGAZINES ANY MORE (EXCEPT ATARI COMPUTING),
 I NO LONGER SEE ANY DECENT DEMOS AND NEVER SEE ANY ADVERTS FOR ATARI ST STUFF.
    IF YOU ARE A PD LIBRARY AND WOULD LIKE POV DISCS (PAST AND PRESENT) THEN GET IN TOUCH
 AT THE ADDRESS COMING UP....    
     IF YOU HAVE ANY DODGY P.O.V. DISCS AND WOULD LIKE THEM REPLACED, WRITE TO.....

          IF YOU JUST WANT
 A CONTACT FOR SWAPPING HINTS AND TIPS OR SOURCE CODE THEN WRITE
 TO THE SAME ADDRESS. THE ONLY ACTIVE MEMBER OF POV IS ME (MAC SYS DATA), I WILL
 ATTEMPT TO WRITE BACK TO ALL LETTERS.        
 IF YOU DO WRITE COULD YOU PLEASE PUT THE RETURN POSTAGE IN THE
 PACKAGE AS IT'S COSTING ME A WAD OF MONEY IN STAMPS.        
 OKAY, I'VE HAD ENOUGH SO DO THE HONOUR ON THE KEYBOARD LAMER.
