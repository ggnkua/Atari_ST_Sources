    THANKS BORIS, WELL WE ARE CERTAINLY MOTORING NOW.
  I HAVE RELEASED A DISC A WEEK FOR 3 WEEKS AND IT LOOKS
 LIKE I'LL DO IT A FORTH TIME AS WELL.    THIS LITTLE
 BATCH OF DISCS ARE ALL OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED ON THE 6TH OF
 APRIL 1992 BUT THEY ARE BASICALLY BEING RELEASED AS I FINISH
 THEM.     WHY THE 6TH OF APRIL?        BECAUSE THAT'S MY
 BIRTHDAY (25 YEARS OLD!).       I WENT TO THE COMPUTER
 SHOP TODAY TO GET MY AMIGA BACK AFTER THE 5 WEEKS IT'S BEEN
 AT COMMOBORE.    I HANDED OVER MY RECEIPT AND WAITED, THE
 MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER BROUGHT MY AN AMIGA AND SHOWED ME THE
 REPAIR BILL.  IT READ LIKE THIS    'REPLACED FAULTY KEYS,
   REPLACED MOTHERBOARD,   REPLACED MOUSE   AND   FIXED CASE'.
    HOLD ON, MY AMIGA DIDN'T HAVE A FAULTY KEYBOARD OR MOUSE!
   I HAD A LOOK AT THE RECEIPT NUMBERS AND FOUND HE WAS TRYING TO
 GIVE ME SOMEBODY ELSES AMIGA.   MY AMIGA WAS IN MINT CONDITION
 DUE TO THE FACT I HARDLY TOUCHED IT, ALL THAT WAS WRONG WAS THAT
 THE WORKBENCH KEPT LOCKING UP AND IT WOULDN'T READ THE PARALLEL
 PORT.     THE MAN LOOKED HIGH AND LOW BUT COULDN'T FIND IT SO HE
 LENT ME AN AMIGA.    I DON'T MIND GETTING A GOOD CONDITION
 MACHINE BUT I HAD ALL THE ENHANCED CHIP SET IN MINE AND HE WAS
 TRYING TO FOB ME OFF WITH A CRAPPY WB 1.2 AND NO ECS - NO WAY!
    IF THEY CAN'T FIND MINE THEN I WANT A NEW ONE.   OH YEAH, I
 HAD AN UPDATED POWER SUPPLY THAT WEIGHED A TON AND THE ONE
 THAT HE LENT ME HAS A VERY LIGHT AND CHEAP POWER SUPPLY (THE
 ONES THAT GO FAULTY).        ANYWAY I CAN NOW START CODING ON
 THE AMIGA GAMES MACHINE (UNLESS I BLOW THIS ONE UP AS WELL!!!).
         I'VE GOT POV 109 ON MY 1 MEG STFM AT THE MOMENT, WHAT A
 MENU!     I THINK I'LL USE THE MENU CODE AGAIN SOON AS IT LOOKS
 SHIT HOT!        IF YOU LIKE MY MENUS THEN LOG ONTO FOUNDATION BBS AND
 DOWNLOAD SOME OF MY SOURCE CODE. I'M TRYING TO GET ALL THE NEW
 SOURCES UPLOADED BUT I DO IT AT WORK AND IT'S A BIT DODGY WHEN
 PEOPLE COME LOOKING AT MY PC TO FIND SOFTWERM SPEWING DATA
 OUT TO THE DIAL UP MODEM.     I PHONED ICD IN AMERICA FROM WORK
 THE OTHER DAY AND DOWNLOADED LOADS OF STUFF SO WORK IS GONNA GET
 A MASSIVE PHONE BILL!!!          IN ONE HOUR I'LL BE WATCHING
 'RED DWARF' SERIES 5, I THINK IT'S GOT A SORT OF CULT FEELING ABOUT
 IT LIKE 'THE YOUNG ONES' HAD.        OH I MUST APPOLOGIZE TO
 ALL THE CREWS OUTSIDE OF THE UK AS YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT HEARD OF
 HALF THE THINGS I MENTION. I DO WRITE ABOUT MANY LOCAL AREA ITEMS
 THAT EVEN PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SOUTH OF THE UK WON'T UNDERSTAND.
  I YOU WERE WONDERING, I COME FROM UP NORTH WHERE MEN ARE MEN AND
 SHEEP ARE SCARED.    I LIVE IN A VILLAGE SEVEN MILES FROM BLACKPOOL
 (WEST COAST OF ENGLAND).   IF YOU ARE A FOREIGN GROUP YOU WILL
 FIND IT ON A MAP ABOVE 'LIVERPOOL'.       FOR ALL YOU SOUTHERN PEOPLE
 BLACKPOOL IS BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND SCOTLAND (ARF-ARF).
       RIGHT ENOUGH OF THIS WIT AND ON WITH THE GREETINGS......
