    THE DEMOS FROM TRANSBEUCE 2 DEMO PARTY HAVE BEEN ALTERED BY
 MSD TO RESET THE MACHINE AT THE END OF THE DEMOS, THE ORIGINAL
 HACKED VERSION HUNG YOUR ST.
      I MUST APPOLGISE FOR THIS DISK AS IT DOES NOT RUN ON A FALCON
 PROPERLY. I TRIED BUT FAILED TO MAKE IT WORK, THE ORIGINAL VERSION
 HAS A DSP DRIVEN MOD PLAYER AS WELL.    IF YOU HAVE A PC AS WELL AS
 A PURE ATARI MACHINE YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS MENU DOES NOT
 RUN UNDER THE PACIFIST EMULATOR. I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHY, I THOUGHT
 IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH TIMER-A THEN I COMMENTED OUT THE MOD AND IT
 STILL HUNG. RATHER THAN SPEND HOURS TRYING TO TRACK THE PROBLEM DOWN I
 GAVE UP AND SO NOW I DETECT IF THE MENU IS RUNNING UNDER PACIFIST AND
 PUT A NOTE UP SAYING IT WON'T WORK.   I HAVE NOT TRIED TO RUN ANY OF
 THE DEMOS UNDER PACIFIST SO THEY MAY WORK (DON'T BET ON IT!).
          YOU MAY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN NOW GET THE RECENT
 POV MENUS ON THE INTERNET AT  WWW.FATAL-DESIGN.COM  THANKS TO JON AND
 CREW FOR THE HARD WORK.
     QUICK GREETS TO  JON AT FATAL DESIGN,  PANDEMONIUM,   TSCC   AND
 ALL THE PC DEMO CREWS.      I HAVE NOT GREETED MANY ATARI CREWS 'COS
 THEY HAVE ALL GIVEN UP.  NO-ONE WRITES TO ME ANY MORE AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
 A NEW DEMO FOR ABOUT A YEAR.
       IT IS NOW AUGUST 1997 AND TODAY I SPENT A   L O T   OF MONEY.    I
 WENT TO PRESTON IN LANCASHIRE, ENGLAND AND BOUGHT A BRAND NEW CAR.    I AM
 NOW THE OWNER OF A SEAT IBIZA CUPRA 2 LITRE 16 VALVE SPEED MACHINE - 150 BHP,
 130 MPH, 0-60 IN 7.6 SECONDS......   FAST   - IT OUT PERFORMS THE NEW BMW Z3 1.9 LITRE
 SPORTS CAR, IN FACT IT OUT PERFORMS A LOT OF CARS.
