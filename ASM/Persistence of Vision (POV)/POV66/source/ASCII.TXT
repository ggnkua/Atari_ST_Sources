                      PERSISTENCE OF VISION DISC 66.    HELLO DEMO FANS,
 WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK?         PRETTY GOOD EH?     THE
 MODULE IS CALLED --- ARMY --- AND WAS CONVERTED
 FROM THE AMIGA BY ME (MSD).   I CHOSE THIS MODULE FROM ABOUT 30
 THAT I HAVE LYING
 AROUND, THE REST ARE GOING ONTO OUR P.O.V./DEMO CLUB
 SOUNDTRACKER DISCS.  WE SHOULD BE RELEASING A NEW
 VERSION OF THE P.O.V. SOUNDTRACKER THAT AUTOMATICALLY
 DETECTS WHICH MACHINE YOU HAVE (ST OR STE) AND THUS PLAYS
 THE MODULE IN MONO OR STEREO RESPECTIVELY.   I CAN'T GIVE A RELEASE
 DATE FOR THE NEW VERSION BECAUSE BORIS HAS THE COMPLETE
 SOURCE CODE ON HIS HARD DISC AND HE'S GONE TO AMERICA FOR
 THREE WEEKS ON HOLIDAY.
      IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE MODULE IS BEING PLAYED
 BACK AT 10KHZ WITH A 16 COLOUR (4 PLANES), 32 BY 32, 8 PIXEL SCROLLER.
     SEE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE QUARTET TO HAVE A TRACKER MENU!
        HERE IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE
 TO ALL YOU PD LIBRARIES THAT CAN'T SPELL...
 OUR NAME IS SPELT    PERSISTENCE.     NOTE THAT
 PERSISTENCE IS SPELT 'ENCE' AT THE END, NOT 'ANCE'.   IF YOU
 DON'T BELIEVE ME ABOUT THE SPELLING THEN HAVE A LOOK
 IN A DICTIONARY.
      HEY OZ - WHAT DO THINK?    I KNEW I COULD DO IT BUT
 UNFORTUNATELY I COULD NOT PUT THE ICE DEPACKER IN HERE AS WELL
 SO TOUGH!!!        WELL AS USUAL HERE ARE THE GREETINGS....
 HI TO   EMPIRE,   BLACK CATS,   ABC CREW,   TEX,   REPLICANTS,
   LOST BOYS,   TCB,   MEDWAY BOYS,   POMPEY PIRATES,   AUTOMATION,
   SEWER SOFTWARE,   GEORGE,   MARTIAN,   DR.SYNE,   EQUINOX,
   ST CONNEXIONS,   INNER CIRCLE,   WATCHMEN,   NOW 5 (SEND
 SOME PICTURES SOON)   AND  TO ALL THE PD LIBRARIES THAT
 NOW DISTRIBUTE OUR DISCS.
        OK THAT'S THE MANDATORY BIT OVER SO I SUPPOSE I HAD BETTER
 WRITE SOME TEXT TO FILL UP THE DISC.       ER...
       YEH,   RIGHT,     HERE WE GO,     GET READY,     THIS IS IT,
     ARE YOU
 SITTING COMFORTABLY?,     ARE YOU RELAXED?,     PREPARE YOURSELF,
             HELLO!
              WELL ACTUALLY HERE IS THE REAL TEXT....  "
 BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.  BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
        YOU DO REALISE THAT I'M STALLING FOR TIME SO YOU CAN LISTEN
 TO THE EXCELLENT TRACKER DON'T YOU?       WHAT, YOU'D RATHER
 LISTEN TO A SOUNDCHIP TUNE?       YEH, ME TOO!!!!!!!
         WELL I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY I'LL MENTION
 WHAT IS TO APPEAR ON A FUTURE P.O.V. DISC.
     IF YOU'RE A KEEN FOLLOWER OF P.O.V. YOU MAY
 BE WONDERING WHERE THE INFO FILE HAS GONE FROM DISC 60. WELL
 WE MISSED IT OUT BECAUSE WE WERE GOING AT SUCH A RATE THAT
 WE HAD TO CODE ONE UP EVERY 8 WEEKS WHICH LEFT LESS TIME FOR
 PACKING AND WRITING MENUS.   I'M GLAD TO INFORM YOU
 THAT THERE WILL BE AN INFO FILE ON P.O.V. 75 THAT WILL
 HAVE ALL THOSE LOVELY DETAILS OF WHAT IS ON MY   ER.. OUR
 DISCS.   I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SORT OF INFO FILE IT WILL BE
 BUT I EXPECT IT WILL BE A SELECTOR TYPE SO YOU CAN
 GO STRAIGHT TO THE DISC YOU WANT INSTEAD OF WADING THROUGH
 ALL THE PREVIOUS DISCS.   WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT TUNE
 EACH MENU USES?     YES?    WELL READ THE SCROLLTEXTS LAMERS!!!
     JOKING ASIDE, I WILL TRY TO PUT ALL THE INFO ABOUT US
 AND OUR DISCS IN THE INFO PROGRAM.     IF YOU GET
 THE SOUTH WEST SOFTWARE LIBRARY UPDATE SHEETS YOU WILL
 ALREADY HAVE SEEN THAT MARTYN HAS STARTED TO INDICATE THE
 MENUS TUNE JUST ABOVE THE DISCS TITLES - COR' THAT MEANS
 SOMEBODY ACTUALLY READS THESE TEXT THINGIES.....
    WELL YOU PROBABLY WON'T BELIEVE ME BUT YOU HAVE JUST READ OVER
 3K OF TEXT!    WOW!    I MUST BE GOING FOR THE RECORD OF
 102K, ACTUALLY I WON'T 'CAUSE TODAY'S IS A WEDNESDAY AND I'M
 TAKING A LOVELY GIRLIE OUT CALLED RACHEL (LUV AND KISSES).
   OO-ER!!!     TALKING OF GIRLIES, AREN'T THERE A LOT
 OF SCHOOLIES ABOUT THESE DAYS?  (MR. PERVY HERE!  WOULD
 YOU LIKE TO SEE SOME PUPPIES?)     WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I
 MEAN, IT'S EITHER I'M BECOMING MORE OF A PERVERT OR THERE
 ARE MORE GIRLS AROUND THAN THERE USED TO BE.
      AYE UP, IT'S 18:37 AND RACHEL IS COMING ROUND AT 19:30 SO
 I'LL FINISH FOR TONIGHT AND CARRY ON TOMORROW.. BYE FOR NOW.
                         HELLO AGAIN, YES IT IS NOW THE 28TH OF
 MARCH AT 20:00 (8 PM), I'VE JUST COME IN LATE FROM WORK 'CAUSE
 I HAD TO BACK UP A DEC VAX STATION 3100 BEFORE I LEFT.
      ANYWAY, HERE I AM AGAIN AND I STILL CAN'T THINK OF
 ANYTHING TO SAY....   ONE THING THAT DOES COME TO MIND
 IS A SLIGHT PROBLEM I HAVE WITH FRIDAY NIGHT... WELL
 I'VE ARRANGED TO SEE RACHEL BUT ANOTHER WOMEN IS EXPECTING
 TO SEE ME IN THE SAME PUB.    SO, WHAT DO I DO?    EASY -
 GO OUT WITH RACHEL (YEH!).      AS I AM RUNNING OUT OF
 THINGS TO SAY, I THINK I'LL TELL YOU WHO WE ARE.    PERSISTENCE
 OF VISION IS A SMALL GROUP FROM JUST OUTSIDE BLACKPOOL, UK.
   THERE ARE 4 MEMBERS WHO ARE;-   MACHINE SYSTEM DATA (ME),
   BORIS,   OZYMANDIAS   AND   ALY.       I AM THE 'BOSS' OF
 THE GROUP 'CAUSE I STARTED IT AND AS YOU PROBABLY
 KNOW, DO NEARLY ALL THE WORK. I HACK/PACK AND WRITE VIRTUALLY
 ALL THE MENUS, I ALSO RIP ALL THE MUSIC.
    NEXT THERE'S BORIS WHO IS A PROGRAMMER AND A STUDENT DOING A DEGREE
 IN COMPUTERS SO HE HAS NOT
 GOT LOADS OF TIME TO WRITE MENUS, PLUS HE IS VEEERRRYYY LAZY
 BUT HE DOES A LITTLE NOW AND AGAIN.    THE NEXT MAN IS CALLED
 OZYMANDIAS AND IS OUR MEGA GRAFIX MAN, IT IS SOMETIMES
 DIFFICULT TO GET HIM TO DO SOME WORK AND HE DOESN'T
 REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS IN ANIMATING SOME OF HIS
 GRAFIX.   THE LAST PERSON IS ALY (WHO MAY BE LEAVING - WELL
 ACTUALLY I'M THINKING OF THROWING HIM OUT!). ALY IS ANOTHER
 GRAFIX ARTIST BUT HIS PICTURES ARE LIKE ROCKING HORSE DUNG
 - VERY RARE!     TOGETHER WE PRODUCE THESE PACKED DEMO
 COMPILATIONS, ONCE FINISHED AND TESTED I PASS THEM TO
 A CONTACT OF THE GROUP CALLED MARTIAN.    MARTIAN
 IS NOT A MEMBER OF P.O.V. BUT
 HE DISTRIBUTES OUR DISCS FOR US TO PD LIBRARIES AROUND THE COUNTRY
 AND COLLECTS DEMOS FOR ME TO PACK.
 I MUST POINT OUT THAT WE ARE NOT A PD LIBRARY AND WE
 WILL NOT REPLY TO LETTERS SEND TO THE ADDRESS PRINTED
 IN ST-FORMAT.       ALL OUR DISCS
 ARE TESTED ON EVERY VERSION OF TOS AND ON MANY DIFFERENT
 MEMORY CONFIGURATIONS.    I TEST THE DISCS ON A 4 MEG STE (TOS 1.60),
 A 1 MEG STFM (1985 TOS) AND A 512K STFM (1988 TOS).  THE
 DISCS ARE THEN TESTED ON THE OTHER MEMBERS MACHINES WHICH
 INCLUDE A 2.5 MEG STFM (1988 TOS) AND ON 2*1 MEG STFMS (1988 TOS).
 IF ANY PROGRAMMERS ARE INTERESTED IN HOW MUCH TIME THIS MENU TAKES
 THEN PRESS HELP TO SHOW THE RASTER LINE (TRY IT IN 60HZ AS WELL).
       IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF OUR DISCS THEN
 GET IN TOUCH VIA ANY POPULAR PD LIBRARY AND WE'LL FIX 'EM.       WELL THIS
 IS THE END OF THE SCROLL TEXT AS I WISH TO VISIT A PUBLIC BAR, SO
 RUN A DEMO AND ENJOY......
