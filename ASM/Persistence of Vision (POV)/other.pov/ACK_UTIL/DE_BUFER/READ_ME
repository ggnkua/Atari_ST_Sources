To use...


Load LOAD.PRG and alter the source to suit the paths, now assemble
     to disc as a PRG.

Goto desktop (or use TOOLS in DEVPAC DEVELOPER) and run NIK.PRG.

      This will run the LOAD.PRG which will load the file and save
it as specified by you in LOAD.S...



Simple isn't it?
