                          Auto-D-Pack Evolution
                          



A-D-P 1.2 - 03/11/95 :

   1 bug fixed and some improvements thanks to K-Woul tests. Thanx !
   -> No more bombs when a program is executed by another one in 'Personal
      Depack' mode.
   -> Modification of the 'Personal Depack' mode management :
      this is no more a trace-rout which is used, but systems-calls.
      The result : better compatibility and the programs are loaded (almost)
      in realtime.
      This long loading time was mostly significant on 68000 computers.
   -> Interface improvement by K-Woul.
   -> AUTODPCK.PRG is modified : use ADP-Convert to keep your old
      configuration files.
   -> SP3_PROG.PRG program is added to the SPACKER3 folder.


A-D-P 1.1 - 01/10/95 :

   3 bugs fixed thanks to K-Woul and The Ace tests. Thanx !
   -> No more bombs when executing a PRG in 'Personal Depack' mode.
   -> No more bombs when changing screen resolution !
   -> No more bombs when AUTODPCK.PRG is not the last file of the
      AUTO folder...


A-D-P 1.0 - 21/09/95 :

   First swapped version.
   All seems to be ok.
