        | Instructions for 'Disk2File Grabber v2.0' by MUG U.K¿ |
        +-------------------------------------------------------+

This will be a short DOC file, for a short program !!  With this little
program, you can grab a whole disk into memory, and save parts off etc.

Using this program, I managed to hack out the music to 'Chips Challenge'
from US Gold (brilliant & addictive game !!).  I have also tested this
disk out on some golden-oldie demos, and also 'Rockstar Ate My Hamster' !!
On 'Rockstar ...', I found the Soundtracker module for the game, so I
promptly ripped it out !!!  I have also managed to get it to 'borrow' three
Amiga '.IFF' file pictures from 'Matrix Marauders' by Psyclapse !!

All you have to do is input the start & end (logical) sectors of the disk
that you want to 'grab' from, then wait for it to get these sectors into
memory.  Unlike the first version of this program, you are not waiting
around, not knowing which sector is being read at the moment, but in this
version I've added a printout option.

Once in memory, the program will ask you to insert another disk (unless
you've got a hard-drive !!) in order to save out the new file.  Now all
you have to do, is load up MONST (or which ever is your favourite
monitor/disassembler/file hacker !!), and play around with your newly
created file.

I have made some provisions for duff disks, but not many as this would
make the program larger than necessary.  Because of the short size, you
can grab a double-sided, 82-track, 10-sector formatted disk in one go, but
only if you've got 1 meg of memory (as any good hacker should have !!) or
more.  

In the previous version of this program, if a disk error occured, you were
returned back to the main menu, and all was lost !!!  Not so, in this
version, if you are prompted with the standard GEM alert box of 'Data in
Drive A: is damaged ...' etc, select the 'Cancel' option.  This will return
control back to my own program, from where you can save up to the last
sector that was read.  This means that the file will contain all the sectors
that were grabbed, before the disk error occured on the current logical
sector.  This feature was put in because I was fed up of playing a trial
and error game, working out which sector had the error on (this is most
usual on heavily protected games - and also some demos !!!).

Unfortunately, I've made no provisions for seperate passes into seperate
files, I'm afraid that is down to you.  So, if you've only got half-meg
of memory, grab the disk required into two (or more) seperate files.


Have fun !!

P.S.  If I can hack music & graphix out with this little program, what can
      you do with it ???
