Right then, this little program will allow you to depack ANY file that
has been packed with any of the following packers; 
        
        Ice Packer v2.11 (data files ONLY at present)
        Ice Packer v2.2 
        Ice Packer v2.31
        Fire Packer v2.01

When I say 'any file' - I mean ANY file, either executable or data files.
The depacking of executable files was prompted by a letter I received from
Chris Smith of Sheffield - thanks a lot, your idea turned out to be very
easy to incorporate !!

This is the second update to my original 'Ice Data Depacker v2.0' that I've
written in July 1991 !!  The first was a specialised version for the
disk magazine 'Maggie', and now this version.  I've tested this program on
both data & executable files packed with the above packers.  The only
problem I've stumbled on is that I haven't found a sure-fire way of depacking
program files packed with Ice v2.11 or earlier versions.

If anyone can supply me with early versions of these packers, the address
is below.  I need working versions of SOURCE CODE as well, not just the
programs !!

All of these packers were written by Axe of Delight/Superior.  Depacking the
resultant files was (and still is ??) a much needed feature missing from
these otherwise excellent packers - especially if you had just packed your
only copy of a much-needed file !!

The program is really easy to use, and should any problems occur, then it is
something that I haven't accounted for (which isn't a lot !!).  All you
have to do is load up my program, and you will prompted with a file-selector
which requires you to click on a file that has been packed with any of the
recognised packers.  

This program will check the whether or not the file is executable or not, and
it will then check for the existance of the 'Ice!', 'ICE!' & 'FIRE' headers.  
It will also recognise the Automation packer headers, but it won't unpack
these files (yet ??) !!!  

If the file is NOT a recognised file, or any disk error occurs, you will
be returned to the first file-selector.  Either try again with another file
or select 'Cancel' from the file-selector, where you will be given the
option of returning to the desktop, or back to the program.

If the file is a packed file, a screen will appear with the following
information on it:-

  i) Which packer was used
 ii) Executable or data file
iii) The length of the file (in disk-space terms)
 iv) The length of the packed file (as the packer knew it as)
  v) The length of the unpacked file (as it will be AFTER it is unpacked)

The reason for including both (iii) & (iv) on the screen, is that some files
I found would be 20K in length, but the ICE header would say it was only
18.5K in length - very odd indeed !!!  Another reason is that some programs
contain two sections (maybe two different packed programs - e.g. Digi 
Composer v1.0 by Istari), so hence the numbers displayed on screen would be
a bit odd !!

If you press a key at this point (ESCAPE will escape - naturally !!) the
file will be depacked (and the screen will flash a bit (oo-er missus !!).

Each depacker will flash a different colour, so as to differentiate between the
different packers.

Next, another file-selector will appear asking for the depacked file.  You
have the option of overwriting the program file (not very wise !!) if you
require - or simply enter a new filename as it is up to you !!

That's all there is to my little program.  It works with almost everything
I've tried, with one or two exceptions - eg. Life's a Bitch Demo (sorry
guys - but I was trying out my Disk2File Grabber, as well as this program
and your demo was perfect for testing !!!).

Have fun, and I look forward to updating this program soon so that it
will work with any versions of the ICE/FIRE Packers.  Does anyone know of
a bug in GFA BASIC v3.5/3.6 when you compile a program, and then attempt to
pack it with Ice v2.2, Ice v2.31 & Fire v2.01 - the program will bomb out
with an address error (2 bombs) when it is depacking ??  In case this is
a machine error - I am using a 1040STFM with TOS v1.02 ROM ..... HELP !!!

If anyone (Axe of Delight ??) would like to send me an up-to-date versions
of the Ice/Fire Packers with this bug fixed, I would be very grateful.  Plus
the version of Fire v2.01 source code that uses registers 'a0' & 'a1' for
source & destination as the one that I was given DOES NOT WORK !!!

If you can help me then write to the address at the end of this file.  
DO NOT send ANY form of pirated software, as the address is for my mates
computer shop !!

I would also like depack source code OR the following packers:-

Automation v2.51+ (I need some fully-explanatory Chunk Depacker Source ??)
Power Packer v2.2a (Amiga Packer used by Rainbow Arts on ST stuff !!!)
YOUR packer (if it's any good that is !!)

If you are wondering what the hell I want all the above packers for, I shall
explain.  I want to write a similar shell as this program, but it will be
able to depack ANY form of packed data by the best packers available !!
The program (if it is ever started !!), will be released into the Public
Domain, and I daresay it could even be well received by everyone - but I
need YOUR help (packer authors especially) in order to finish it off !!

A quick message to JPM (author of Pompey Packer):-  Which registers do I
need to call in order to depack your data files ???  Please get in touch
as soon as possible (confidentiality assured) or via 'Slasher of the
Bog Brothers' !!


Have fun

Any problems, queries, questions etc. should be sent to the above address,
and don't even think of writing if you want copies of software etc.  
I get extremely FED UP with people who write to me wanting the addresses of
Automation, Medway Boys, Pompey Pirates etc.   I DON'T KNOW THEM SO *ISS
OFF !!!!  I will keep all the disks & burn the letters of idiots who write
to me asking me for the addresses of so-and-so etc.
