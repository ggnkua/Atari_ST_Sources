                              by  Steven Grimm

     This program allows users with double-sided disk drives to store two
single-sided disks on one double-sided disk.  It will copy from either side on
either floppy to either side on either floppy.  It's mainly useful for
archival purposes; one double-sided disk can take the place of two single-
sided disks.

     To use the program, double-click on DISKDOUB.PRG.  A dialog box will
appear, allowing you to select a disk drive and side for both the source
and target disks.  Single-drive copying is supported.  You can also choose
to format the target side (for instance, to format the back of a disk but
leave the front alone.)

     Once you've set up the proper drives and sides, click on the COPY
button.  Two rows of minus signs will appear at the bottom of the screen,
and gradually change to plus signs as the copying progresses.  When both
rows are filled with plusses, the copy is complete.

     Currently, Disk Doubler only copies unprotected disks with 80 tracks
and nine sectors per track.  Future revisions will support extended disk
formats and copy-protected formats.

     Disk Doubler is a public-domain program.  Please distribute it as
widely as possible.
