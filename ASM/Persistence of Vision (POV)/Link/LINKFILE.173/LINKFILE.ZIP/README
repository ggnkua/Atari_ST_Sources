                  Brown Beer Bottle developments link filer.


Note:  I have released this code onto the World so someone can use it
       instead of it lying on my hard disc.

       One thing to note though.... when the link filer code specifies
       MAKELINK.PRG it really means MSDLINK2.PRG this is because the code
       was modified to include file extensions and the GFA basic program
       has an option to generate 16 or 12 bytes filename tables.
       When this option appears select the 16 byte filename option or it
       won't work!!!!
