     HELLO POV FANS, MSD HERE AGAIN (WHAT A SURPRISE). WELL AS I 
SAID ON POV 136, OZ IS NOW BACK AND IS DOING SOME MORE PICTURES.
   P.O.V. CAN BE SEEN ON THE ST/STE, AMIGA, MAC, SNES AND MEGADRIVE.
   WE DON'T ALWAYS USE THE SAME NAMES BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
RECOGNISE OUR STYLE OR EVEN OUR REAL NAMES.     I AM STILL THINKING 
OF BUYING A NEW MACHINE BUT I HAVE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE 
FALCON SINCE I SAW OZ'S MAC.     I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINK AND IF 
YOU SAW A MAC WITH LOADS OF WINDOWS ALL SHOWING A 256 COLOUR PICTURE 
AND THE MACHINE WAS STILL PLAYING A NOISETRACKER MOD AT 11 KHZ. YOU 
CAN HAVE 65535 COLOURS IN EACH WINDOW BUT OZ ONLY HAS 8 MEG RAM AND
IT NEEDS MORE. OZ HAS LOADS OF SOFTWARE INCLUDING A RAYTRACER (WHICH NEEDS 
A CO-PROCESSOR), GAMES, ART AND DTP.   I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FALCON 
WITH A NEW CASE AND THE BUGS FIXED, RUNNING SOME DECENT SOFTWARE 
AND SOME PC'S WITH DECENT SOUND CARDS AND VIDEO CARDS BEFORE I MAKE 
A DECISION AS I THINK THE FALCON IS GOING TO FAIL DESPITE EVERYONE 
RAVING ABOUT IT.     I HAVE SOME NEWS ABOUT THE NEW ATARI CONSOLE 
CALLED THE 'JAGUAR', ATARI HAVE SIGNED A 500 MILLION DOLLAR DEAL WITH 
IBM FOR THE CONSOLE TO BE MADE IN IBM'S PLANT IN CAROLINA SO IT SHOULD 
BE A DECENT QUALITY MADE MACHINE.           IF YOU WANT TO CONTACT
