CYBER PAINT README FILE NOTES:



Hello!  There are a few features which have been added to CYBER PAINT
at the last minute and are not in the manual:

While the Palette submenu is on the screen, you can select a color
by left-clicking directly on any color in your drawing, as well as by
clicking on the Color Bar.

The keyboard alternative to clicking on the frame mode box is pressing
the period [.].  This will cycle you through f, s, and a.

NOTE:  If, when you exit Cyber Paint, the GEM directory windows
do not completely redraw on the Desktop, click in the window to
force the redraw.  This is a GEM problem that we tried valiantly
to overcome in 100% of the cases, but it may crop up occassionally.
If it does happen, it's nothing to worry about.


A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE TWISTER FORMAT:

This disk has been formatted at 10 sectors-per-track, instead of
the usual 9 sectors-per-track that the TOS/GEM format routines
use.  That means that although you can read this disk, you can't
do a standard GEM desktop disk copy of it.  Because this technique
was first introduced by Dave Small and Dan Moore in START IV within
a program called Twister, we call this format a "twisted disk."
We've "twisted" this disk because it allowed us to fit a couple
more animation demos on for you to see (you get about 60K extra
on a single-sided disk this way).  

So, to make a backup copy of these files, you can either:

      1.  Drag the files, except for the ANIMATOR.003 folder over
to another single sided disk, or drag all the files to a double
sided disk.

      2.  Copy the disk using a bit-copier, such as Procopy, or
DC Format, the EXCELLENT disk format utility that you'll find
as shareware on all the online services, most BBS's, and user group
PD libraries (ie, it's in DL3 of ATARI16 on CompuServe).  

Whichever way you decide to do it, do it as soon as you get your disk.
Don't wait to make a backup until you've blown your master disk.

Plus, it's a good idea to have DC Format around to use to format your
floppies with.  The extra space is usually vital to store your
animations.  

Note for people with the Mega ST ROM's:  DC Format will work fine with
these ROM's, but the original Twister program won't.  Find DC Format.
