      HELLO TO 'SOURCE' OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS, I AWAIT YOUR DEMO
 COMPILATIONS WITH INTEREST (OR BOREDOM!).       I'VE JUST HEARD FROM
 BORIS THAT HE HAS GOT THE JOB MENTIONED ON AN EARLIER DISC...   IF
 YOU DIDN'T SEE THE DISC THEN HERE IS A RECAP... BORIS WENT TO A
 PLACE FOR A PROGRAMMING JOB IN LEEDS. WHEN HE GOT THERE HE FOUND
 THAT THE BOSS OF THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WAS WAYNE SMITHSON (HE
 WROTE BAAL AND BLOOD MONEY).   ANYWAY AFTER THE INTERVIEW BORIS GOT
 CONFORMATION THAT HE HAS A JOB CODING GAMES ON THE SEGA MEGADRIVE.
    WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO, FIRST OZYMANDIAS HAS BEEN DOING GRAFIX
 LIKE THERE IS NO TOMORROW AND INTENDS TO SEND THEM TO OCEAN THEN BORIS
 GETS A PROGRAMMING JOB. I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN P.O.V. WHO ISN'T GOING
 FOR A PROFESSIONAL JOB IN THE GAMES MARKET.                     
   WELL WHO CARES 'CAUSE
 I'M ON A GOOD EARNER JOINING DIFFERENT MAKES OF COMPUTERS UP AND FIXING
 FAULTS ON COMPUTER NETWORKS.
         ONCE I FIND THE STE SOUNDTRACKER REPLAY
 CODE ON MY HARD DISC I'LL WRITE A COUPLE OF STE FILLER DEMOS THAT
 PLAY TRACKERS.  THE DEMOS WILL NOT BE SUPER ALL SINGING, ALL
 DANCING ONES BUT SIMPLE SMALL DEMOS THAT FILL UP THE DISCS.
            I HOPE DEMOS 2 AND 3 WORK ON 512K STE'S AS I ONLY HAVE A
 4 MEG STE TO TEST THEM ON. IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE I MAY
 BE BUYING A 2 MEG MEGA-STE WITH MONO MONITOR. IF I GET ONE THEN
 I'LL SELL MY STE WITH 2 MEG RAM FOR SOME 280 POUNDS. IF IT SOUNDS
 RATHER CHEAP THEN LOOK IN THE MAGS AS YOU CAN GET A BRAND NEW 1 MEG
 STE FOR SOME 300 POUNDS....
    
            WELL IT'S 17:23 AND I WENT TO THE PUB THIS AFTERNOON AND I
 FEEL BRAIN DEAD, THEREFORE AS A RESULT I'LL ENDING THIS SCROLLTEXT HERE.
