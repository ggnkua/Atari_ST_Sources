     WELL THAT'S ALL THE CRAP OUT OF THE WAY SO HERE WE GO WITH SOME
 WAFFLE....        HELLO FANS, IT'S ME AGAIN (MAC SYS DATA) WRITING
 THIS TEXT FROM MY QUIET BEDROOM SOME 8 MILES FROM BLACKPOOL.   ACTUALLY
 IT IS VERY QUIET IN HERE 'CAUSE I'VE TURNED ALL MY EQUIPMENT OFF
 EXCEPT FOR THIS 4 MEG STE SET UP.  I WOULD USUALLY HAVE MY STEREO
 BLASTING CARTER THE UNSTOPPABLE SEX MACHINE OR NEDS ATOMIC DUSTBIN OR EVEN
 GUNS 'N' ROSES, THE REASON IT'S SO QUIET IS THAT MY PARENTS HAVE JUST
 GONE TO BED SO I THOUGHT I'D BETTER SHUT UP.          I THINK I'LL
 DO THE GREETINGS NOW.... BUT FIRST (HA, YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE
 LONGER)...       I MUST SEND LOTS OF BOTTOM LICKS TO L.A.P.D. AS THIS LIBRARY SENT
 US A BATCH OF DISCS AS SOON AS WE ASKED UNLIKE MANY OTHER PD LIBRARIES THAT HAVEN'T.    
     RIGHT, HERE ARE THE GREETS.. HELLO TO.....     GOT YA!!!!!!
    WELL ISN'T IT STRANGE, YOU GO TO THE PUB WITH AN OLD FLAME WHO
 WANTS TO BE 'JUST FRIENDS' AND SHE BRINGS HER MATE ALONG.     THE
 NIGHT GETS OLD AND AFTER SEVERAL BEERS YOU AND THE FLAMES FRIEND
 ARE GETTING ON LIKE A HOUSE ON FIRE.    MAYBE A HOUSE WHICH IS
 BURNING OUT OF CONTROL?       OH NO!     OR SHOULD IT BE OH YES!!!!
        ENOUGH OF THESE CRIPTIC COMMENTS, YES I GOT OFF WITH
 MY OLD FLAMES FRIEND.    HELLO DAWN, HOW ARE YOU? 
 I DON'T THINK RACHEL WAS TOO PLEASED WITH US AFTER MONDAY NIGHT AT
 THE 'TACHE' IN BLACKPOOL BUT I'LL SEE YOU ON FRIDAY OKAY?      
  WHEN AN OLD FLAME WANTS TO BE 'FRIENDS' BUT SHE KEEPS HER EYE
 GLUED TO YOU ALL NIGHT AND GIVES ANY GIRL WHO TALKS TO YOU THE EVIL EYE,
 I THINK IT'S A LITTLE DEEPER THAN "FRIENDS".    YES IF YOU READ THESE CRAPPY SCROLL
 TEXTS THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH A GIRL CALLED
 RACHEL, THING IS.... SHE IS MOVING BACK TO NEWCASTLE IN 2 DAYS AND
 I'LL BE LEFT HERE.   SHE'LL NEVER WRITE TO ME AND WE BOTH KNOW IT, SO
 I'D BETTER START FORGETTING HER.      
      ARE YOU STILL THERE?          WHAT DO YOU WANT?             THE WHAT?
         GREETINGS?            WHY?            OH I SEE, YOU WANT
 TO SEE IF WE HAVE GREETED YOU. WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAVEN'T.    
              YOU STILL THERE?          RIGHT, IF YOU DON'T
 BELEIVE ME TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF....     GREETING TO
