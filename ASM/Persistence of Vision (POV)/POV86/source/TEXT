            RIGHT, IT'S MAC SYS DATA ON THE KEYBOARD (ME).   TODAY
 IS A SUNDAY AND I'VE BEEN AT WORK ALL DAY DOING DRAWINGS ON CAD.   I
 WAS HALF WAY THROUGH A LARGE DIAGRAM WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO
 SAVE THE THING....   OK, SAVE BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.        I WAITED
 AND WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED THEN.......    'NETWORK PATH NO
 LONGER EXISTS - RETRY, ABORT, IGNORE'.              WHAT?
      OK, RETRY.       (SAME ERROR OCCURS)        OK, IGNORE.       
 (RESET)         OK SHIT!          TWO AND A HALF HOURS DOWN THE DRAIN.
       I INVESTIGATED THE PS2 MODEL 80........   WHY IS THE POWER LIGHT
 OFF?     OH GOD, THE POWER SUPPLY HAS BLOWN UP AND ALL MY
 DRAWINGS ARE ON THAT SERVER. AS USUAL IN THESE SITUATIONS A QUICK TURN
 OFF AND BACK ON BROUGHT THE THING BACK UP AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE
 FOR AN HOUR OR TWO THEN    POP,   WHIRR,      STOP...............
         OFF/ON, HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!       TOMORROW I'LL HAVE TO GET
 THE SERVICE ENGINEER OUT TO SWAP THE POWER SUPPLY AGAIN (3 IN 1 WEEK!).
          RIGHT, WORK IS BORING SO I'LL TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE...
         THE PRICE OF BACON!          (OH MY GOD, HE'S BEEN ON THE MAGIC
 MUSHROOMS AGAIN!)...         I WANT BEER!         ACTUALLY I WAS VERY
 DEPRESSED LAST NIGHT AND ONLY MANAGED 2 PINTS OF BEER. THE NIGHT BEFORE
 I WAS WELL ON MY WAY TO GETTING LEGLESS WHILST I WAITED FOR A FEMALE TO
 ARRIVE IN THE PUB (OO-ER). I WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED (I'M SURE I'VE
 HEARD THIS BEFORE) BUT SHE NEVER ARRIVED SO I ENDED UP GOING HOME ON MY OWN.
   LAST NIGHT THE FEMALE WAS IN BUT BECAUSE I WAS FEELING DOWN I DIDN'T
 TALK TO HER, I JUST STOOD AT THE BAR AND DRUNK MY BEER VERY SLOWLY.    
      TONIGHT LATER ON (WELL IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES) I'M GOING TO THE SAME
 PUB TO SEE A GROUP.   I DON'T KNOW WHY HE IS A GROUP 'CAUSE THERE IS
 ONLY ONE OF HIM AND HE USES A BACKING TAPE FOR THE DRUMS AND KEYBOARDS
 BUT HE IS PRETTY GOOD AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHEN YOU'RE P-SSED
 OUT OF YOUR SKULL DOES IT????          NO I WON'T GET DRUNK REALLY 'CAUSE
 I'M DRIVING DOWN THERE TONIGHT SO IT LOOKS LIKE A NIGHT OF DRINKING COKE.
       2274 BYTES OF TEXT AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF THINGS TO SAY...
   THERE ARE OF COURSE THE GREETING TO COME YET BUT FIRST.....
 (I HATE WHEN THE GREETINGS ARE AT THE END OF A SCROLLER. YOU WAIT FOR
 AGES ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT YOU AREN'T MENTIONED).       TO PUT ONE
 PERSON OUT OF HIS MISERY I'LL DO A QUICK MENTION TO A BLOKE CALLED
 GREGORY (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE), I'LL COPY THE DISCS A.S.A.P. AS I'VE JUST
 RECEIVED 800 BLANKS (SONY BULK BUY FROM B.C.S - A DECENT COMPANY UNLIKE
 THIRD COAST LAMERS).        
                        BYE, BYE....................
