          WE HAVE NOW RELEASED 95 DEMO COMPILATION
 DISCS AND WE'RE GOING STRONGER THAN EVER. I HAVE TO ADMIT,
 THOUGH, THAT MAC SYS DATA HAS DONE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK
 AND WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL THAT HE HAS KEPT GOING WITHOUT MUCH
 SUPPORT, AT TIMES, FROM THE REST OF US. AS I HAVE NOW
 FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY AND STARTED A JOB, I HAVE BEEN ABLE
 TO CODE MUCH MORE STUFF - THIS EXPLAINS WHY A LOT OF THE
 RECENT p MENUS ARE BY ME! I HOPE YOU LIKE THEM BECAUSE
 I HAVE QUITE A FEW MORE IDEAS FOR MENUS IN THE FUTURE.
     I'LL HAND THE CONTROLS OVER TO MAC SYS DATA NOW SEEING
 AS HE'S PUTTING THE DISC TOGETHER...
              HELLO ALL (M.S.D. AT THE HELM), WELL THIS DISC IS BEING THROWN TOGETHER AS
 I HAVE NOT RELEASED A DISC FOR QUITE A WHILE.         SINCE THE
 LAST MENU I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TRACK DOWN SOME DEMOS AS OUR SUPPLIER
 HAS LET US DOWN AND AS A RESULT I HAVE HAD NO NEW DEMOS FOR 4 MONTHS.
         I MUST THANK 'STEVE DAVIS' (YES THAT'S AN ALIAS!) FOR THE
 FEW DISCS HE HAS SUPPLIED LATELY, AS A RESULT WE ARE NOW USING ICE PACK 2.40
 AND HE IS USING P.O.V. MENU CODE.            
   RIGHT, QUESTION TIME.....      DO YOU COLLECT DEMOS?         
 DO YOU HAVE GOOD CONTACTS?         
 DO YOU GET ALL THE NEW STUFF AS SOON AS IT HAS BEEN RELEASED?         
 DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPARE TIME?         
 WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE A MEMBER OF A VERY POPULAR DEMO PACKING GROUP?           
 IF THE ANSWER TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS IS YES, THEN WE WANT TO HEAR FROM
 YOU.      WE ARE NOW FED UP WITH MARTIAN (YES YOU MARTIAN) AS HE DOES
 NOT GET THE DISCS TO US WHEN ASKED. I KNOW YOU STARTED SPREADING P.O.V. DISCS AND COLLECT
 DEMOS FOR US ON YOUR OWN BACK AND WE ARE ALL THANKFUL
 FOR THE SERVICE YOU WAS PERFORMING. WE TRY TO SHOW OUR THANKS BY GREETING YOU A HELL OF A LOT
 ON THE MENUS BUT..... WE WANT BETTER COMMUNICATIONS AND
 A MORE EFFICIENT SERVICE.         WE AT P.O.V. NOW REQUIRE A FULL TIME MEMBER
 WHO CAN GET DEMOS TO US LIKE YESTERDAY AND IS WILLING TO PUT A LOT
 OF TIME INTO THE JOB.       WE WILL REQUIRE THE NEW MEMBER TO TAKE
 ALL THE HASSLE OF SUPPLYING NEW PD LIBRARIES THAT NOW REQUIRE A
 'DIRECT' LINK WITH P.O.V. AWAY FROM US (YES MARTIAN, SOME PD LIBRARIES ARE FED
 UP WITH YOU AS WELL!).      THE MEMBER WILL HAVE TO PRINT LETTERS TO
 OTHER GROUPS AND PD LIBRARIES AND WILL HAVE TO VISIT THE POST OFFICE
 VERY FREQUENTLY.  IF YOU ARE THINKING 'YEAH, I CAN A MEMBER OF P.O.V. AND
 HAVE FAME AND FORTUNE' WELL THINK AGAIN.   YES, YOU WILL BE A MEMBER
 AND HAVE YOUR NAME ALL OVER OUR MENUS SO THERE IS FAME BUT THE
 FORTUNE IS NOT HERE.    WE AT P.O.V. MAKE A LOSS OUT OF THESE DISCS AND
 YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO SPEND SOME OF YOUR OWN MONEY ON STAMPS AND
 ENVOLOPES.   WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SUPPLY OF SECOND HAND JIFFY BAGS
 WHICH DOES KEEP US GOING BUT WE HAVE TO BUY SOME NEW ONE AND WE CAN'T
 PRINT OUR OWN STAMPS SO WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM.        OUR
 PRESENT DEALER HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH PD LIBRARIES THAT HE GETS A POUND
 A DISC. THE COST COVERS THE 22 PENCE STAMP (24 PENCE SOON), THE JIFFY BAG,
 THE DISC AND PART OF THE P.O. BOX COST.     WHAT'S LEFT GOES INTO HIS POCKET WHICH IS
 BASICALLY BUGGER ALL!           RIGHT, THAT ABOUT COVERS THE PROBLEM
 WE HAVE.   I WOULD LIKE TO THANK FRIENDS OF MANI FROM NORTHSIDE
 WHO HAVE SUPPLIED US VIA HIM WITH DEMOS, I HOPE MY WORK AND MENUS
 FOR NORTHSIDE ARE APPRECIATED. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK DEL AT D.W. STABLES
 FOR THE SMALL SUPPLY HE HAS MADE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT GIVING US.      
    IF ANY PD LIBRARIES HAVE NEW DEMOS, PLEASE SEND THEM TO ME (MAC SYS DATA)
 AT THE REGULAR ADDRESS.            IF YOU ARE A NEW PD LIBRARY OR SIMPLY
 WANT TO WRITE TO P.O.V. THEN ADDRESS
 YOUR LETTERS TO..         P.O.V.,          P.O. BOX 40,
