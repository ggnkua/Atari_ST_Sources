I found this file on the local ATARI Company's BBS : (original in Dutch)

This article is written by Wilfred Kilwinger (Support Manager) for
Atari Briefing, the newsletter by Atari (Benelux) B.V. for the Atari 
user groups. It was specifically stated that it could be reproduced. I have
translated it in English with the assumption that an English translation
would be considered the same as the original.

The original also contained a description of all the features of the Falcon
which have been reproduced here a zillion of times so I did not include
these. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atari custom chips

VIDEL

The VIDEL takes care of the video functions of the system including
overscan, overlay mode and true color graphics

COMBEL

The COMBEL is the system manager of the Atari Falcon030. This chip controls
all system functions. Also the BLITTER is built in in this chip.

SDMA

The SDMA is the Sound DMA and controls the sound part. We have built in a
unique matrix switch function in this chip (more details in the second part)

KEYBOARD PROCESSOR

The keyboard processor has been improved and is now also suitable for high
resolution mice.

Besides the above custom chips the Atari Falcon030 has a number of standard
chips like the Motorola 68030 and 56001 DSP. Another important chip is the
CODEC in which the 16 bit AD and DA converters are located.

Video modi

As you can see in the survey of Operating System calls
the video hardware is complete sotware controllable. The following
combinations can a.o. be chosen:

Mode      Resolution  Bit planes  Colors  Palette

ST LOW     320x200       4           16     4096
ST MED     640x200       2            4     4096
ST HIGH    640x400       1            2     4096

True Color 640x480       8          256   262144
           320x200     15bpp      32768     N/A

The last mode asks for some explanation. Here there is no color palette but
15 bits per pixel to describe the pixel itself. The format is
RRRRRGGGGGXBBBBB. VDI supports this mode thus programs that have not been
written for this mode specifically can use it nevertheless.
X is the overlay bit and can be used for video titling and special effects.

          320x200     16bpp      65         N/A

This mode is called the slideshow mode, is not supported by the VDI, you
are on you own. X is an extra green bit.


True Color in 640x480 is not possible because of the bandwidth of VGA monitors.

Mode      Resolution Bit planes   Colors    Palette

VGA      320 of 640   1,4,8       2,16,256  262144 (Overscan 
Video    200 of 400

With Video we mean the Atari SC-monitors, the TV modulator and/or the
composite video output.

All modes can be gegenlocked. With adaptors we convert
the 15-pole video bus to thee standard Atari or VGA connections.

Matrix coupling

To make the system performance in the audio part as good as possible Atari
designed a miniature 'telephone exchange' that can easily connect the
source devices to the receiving devices. Also it is possible to make more
than one connection at a time.

VIDEO SETMODE

int setmode( int modecode );

The setmode( int modecode ) call is used to place the Falcon/030 SHIFTER
into a specific mode. A bit-encoded value (called a "modecode") is passed
to setmode() to set the mode. setmode() returns the previous mode that 
was set.

To help make the building of modecode values easier, here is a table of
defines:

        #define VERTFLAG        0x100
        #define STMODES         0x80
        #define OVERSCAN        0x40
        #define PAL             0x20
        #define VGA             0x10
        #define TV              0x0

        #define COL80           0x08
        #define COL40           0x0
        #define NUMCOLS         7

        #define BPS16           4
        #define BPS8            3
        #define BPS4            2
        #define BPS2            1
        #define BPS1            0

Using these defines, you can build a modecode for any possible mode.
For example:

        For True Color Overscan:
        modecode = OVERSCAN|COL40|BPS16;
        
        For ST Medium Compatibility mode on a Color Monitor/TV:
        modecode = STMODES|COL80|BPS2;

        For ST Low Compatibility mode in PAL on a Color Monitor/TV:
        modecode = STMODES|PAL|COL80|BPS2;

        For 256 color, 80 column mode on a VGA monitor:
        modecode = VGA|COL80|BPS8;

If you have a modecode and wish to know how many bits per pixel it
has, use the following:

        if( modecode & NUMCOLS ) == BPS16 )
                do_something_cool();    /* You have true color mode */

The setmode() call will return the previous modecode set. You must use
this value to get back to whatever mode you were in before you made your 
setmode call.


int mon_type(void)

The mon_type() function will return the kind of monitor that is currently
in use. Here are the possible return values:

        0 = ST monochrome monitor
        1 = ST color monitor
        2 = VGA monitor
        3 = Television. 


void ext_sync( int flag )

This function sets or clears external sync. If flag is set, external 
sync is enabled. If flag is clear, then internal sync is used.


SOUND-calls

locksnd();
Used as a semiphore to lock the sound system. From other applications.

unlocksnd();    
Used to release the sound system for other applications to use.

soundcmd(mode,data);
This command is used to get or set the following sound parameters.
If a negative number is used as the input then the current setting us
returned.

MODE    OPERATION       MEANING 

O       LTATTEN Sets the current left channel output

1       RTATTEN Sets the current right channel output

2       LTGAIN  Sets the current left channel input gain.

3       RTGAIN  Sets the current right channel input gain.

4       ADDERIN Set the output of the 16 bit signed adder to
                receive it's input from the ADC, Matrix or
                both.

5       ADCINPUT        Set the input the the ADC. The input can either
                        be the left and right channel of the PSG or the
                        left and right channel of the microphone.

6       SETPRESCALE     Used for compatability. This prescale value
                        is used when the DEVCONNECT() internal
                        prescale value is set to zero.


setbuffer(reg,begaddr,endaddr);
This function is used to set the play or record buffers. REG selects
playback or record, while begaddr and endaddr are the buffers beginning
and ending locations.

        (int)   reg             - (0) Sets playback registers.
                                - (1) Sets record registers.
        (long)  begaddr - Sets the beginning address of the buffer.
        (long)  endaddr - Sets the ending address of the buffer.

setmode(mode);
This function is used to set record or playback mode. The modes are as
follows:

MODE            OPERATION
(int)   0      8 Bit Stereo
(int)   1      16 Bit Stereo
(int)   2      8 Bit Mono

settracks(playtracks,rectracks);
This function is used to sets the number of record or playback tracks.

setmontracks(montrack);
This function is used to set the output of the internal speaker to one of
the four tracks currently playing. The internal speaker is only capable of
outputing ONE track at a time.

setinterrupt(src_inter,cause);
This function is used to set which interrupt that will occur at the end of a
frame. If the frame repeat bit is on, this interrupt is used to allow for 
double buffering the playing or recording of sound. Interrupts can come from
TimerA or the MFP i7.

buffoper(mode);
This function is used to control the operation of the play or record buffers
in the sound system. The input to this function is a bitmap. If mode is set
t0 -1 then the current status of the buffer operation bits is returned.

NOTE:   The sound system contains a 32 byte FIFO. When transferring data to 
the record buffer, software MUST check to see if the record enable (RE) bit 
was cleared by the hardware. If the bit was cleared then the FIFO is flushed,
if not then software must flush the FIFO by clearing the record enable (RE)
bit. 

dsptristate(dspxmit,dsprec);
This function is used to tristate the DSP from the data matrix. 

gpio(mode,data);
This is used to communicate over the General Purpose I/O on the DSP connector.
Only the low order three bits are used. The rest are reserved. This call,
depending on the mode, can be used to set the direction of the I/O bits, read
the bits, or write the bits. 

devconnect(src,dst,srcclk,prescale,protocol);
This function is used to attach a source device to any of the destination
devices in the matrix. Given a source device, this call will attach that one
source device to one or all of the destination devices. This call also sets
up the source clock and prescaler, protocol and protocol source if used.

sndstatus(reset);
This function gets the current status of the codec.

buffptr(pointer);
This function returns the current position of the play and record data buffer
pointers. These pointers indicate where the data is being read/written within
the buffers themselves. This function is also used to  determine how much
data has been written to the record buffer. See buffoper().


The above is not yet complete. Atari has also routines for
JPEG and andio conversion.
