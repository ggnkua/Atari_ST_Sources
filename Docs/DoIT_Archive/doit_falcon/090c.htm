<p>Well after opening the CAC there is simply a crystal (to give CAF
a 44.1KHz sample rate) an IC and some resistors. One would have to
take the Word Clock signal and change it to what the Falcon needs.
Since I have an FDI, I don't need the CAC.
<br>
</p>
<p>But how to change the Word Clock? in fact what are the specs for
WordClock I do know something about it being TTL level etc... These
are the frequencies that the Falcon needs to get 44.1, 48 etc.
<br>
</p>
<pre>
Master clock   Divisor(n)   Bit Rate   Sample Rate
---------------------------------------------------------

25.175  MHz       4        6.29375 MHz  49.17 KHz (50KHz)
22.5792 MHz       4        5.6448  MHz  44.1  KHz (CD)
24.576  MHz       4        6.144   MHz  48.0  KHz (DAT)
32.000  MHz       4        8.000   MHz  62.5  KHz
---------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Now the trick is to get Word Clock to a MHz freq and then just put
in a switch where the new signal will replace the internally available
sample rates.
<br>
</p>
<p>After getting confused I got a Z-1SRC Sample Rate converter that
locksto Word Clock, also Ardvark? makes a master Word Clock generator.
<br>
</p>
<p>It seems simple enough though.

<p>Here is a file on the audio matrix of the Falcon. The last part
has a pin out (of the DSP) to the Steinberg DB15, in case your cable
gets damaged.

</pre>
<p>The digital processing sub-system has many features which make it
ideal for audio processing. However, the data being processed can also
be video (images), graphics objects (3-D image manipulation) or any
other general purpose data.
<br>
</p>
<p>To maintain the maximum flexibility, the Atari Falcon030 provides
an extremely general connection system between these components. All
data transfers are in a synchronous serial format. Any component can
talk with any other. Since some of the components have real time
response requirements, the clocking schemes have also been made
especially general and flexible.
<br>
</p>
<p>Communications
<br>Any two devices in the sub-system can talk with each other. To
allow them to talk you need to connect them together correctly. This
requires several things:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>
1) Connect the two devices (a receiving device to a source device)
2) Select the source clock
3) Select the communication protocol (handshake or continuous)

</pre>
<p>Connections
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>There are four devices capable of sending data and four devices
capable of receiving data. To allow any connection therefore requires
a four by four matrix:

<p>Each receiving device can have its data path connected to any one
source device. Source devices &quot;source&quot; data. For example,
the ADC represents data from the microphone jack so the ADC is a data
source. It can send it's data to any (or all) receiving devices. See
the &quot;Devices&quot; section for more details.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Clock Sources
<br>
</p>
<p>All the data connections shown above, are actually serial data
paths which include a bit clock, data, and synchronization signal.
There are three possible clock sources in the system:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>
Internal clock (25.175 MHz)
Internal clock (32 MHz)
External clock

</pre>
<p>Each source device must select one of these clocks as its master
clock. The <a href="04010a.htm" target="UDOcon">Codec</a> can only use the Internal 25.175MHz, or External
clock. The bit clock is taken from the master clock divided by a
programmable value of 4 to 24 (in increments of 4). The Sample rate is
then the bit rate, divided by 128:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>                      ___________                 ___________
Master Clock         | Divide by |   Bit Rate    | Divide by |  Sample
Rate                 |           |               |           |
---------------&gt;-----|     n     |--------&gt;------|    128    |-------&gt;-------
                      -----------                 -----------
</pre>
<p>Since the bit rate is 128 times the sample rate, there is room for
eight 16-bit samples per sample period.(!nl)
</p>
<pre>
Master clock   Divisor(n)   Bit Rate   Sample Rate
---------------------------------------------------------

25.175  MHz       4        6.29375 MHz  49.17 KHz (50KHz)
22.5792 MHz       4        5.6448  MHz  44.1  KHz (CD)
24.576  MHz       4        6.144   MHz  48.0  KHz (DAT)
32.000  MHz       4        8.000   MHz  62.5  KHz
---------------------------------------------------------

</pre>
<p>The internal 25.175 MHz clock is used to support STE compatible
50KHz, 25KHz, and 12.5KHz sound sample rates. (Note that the built in
DACs do not actually support a 6.25KHz sample rate) The internal 32
MHz clock is useful since it can be used to provide an 8 MHz bit rate
(or 1 Megabyte per second), which is the maximum transfer rate of the
DSP SSI interface.
<br>
</p>
<p>The external clock comes from the DSP connector. It can run up to
32 MHz. Some useful external clock rates are shown below:
<br>
<br>22.5792 MHz gives CD rate of 44.1 KHz
<br>24.576 MHz gives DAT rate of 48.0 KHz
<br>
</p>
<p>Communications Protocols
<br>
<br>Data sometimes gets lost. We all do it. Even a piece of perfectly
well designed hardware can do it. The maximum data rate of the DMA
record or playback channels is 1 Megabyte per second each. Since the
FIFOs are 32 bytes deep each sound DMA channel will require bus access
approximately every 32 microseconds.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, poorly written software can create situations where
this access requirement is not met. A combination of other devices may
lock out the bus from sound DMA, particularly, badly behaved expansion
port devices and true color video.
<br>
</p>
<p>If the data is sound data and it is not critical, then an
occasional overrun or underrun may be acceptable. If the data is JPEG
video, DSP object code, or any other non redundant data, then you wlll
want to guarantee it is never mislaid.
<br>
</p>
<p>For precisely this purpose our system includes a special
handshaking mode which prevents overrun or underrun. When in
handshaking mode, the data rate can be variable since timely bus
access cannot be guaranteed. This also means that in handshaking mode
there is no concept of a sample rate, or left and right tracks, or
multiple tracks at all. The data is simply transferred one word at a
time as quickly as the source and receiving devices can communicate.
<br>
<br>If timely bus access can be guaranteed it is better to use
continuous mode. Continuous mode should be used for any real time
applications (such as sound playback or record), and it will generally
be more effictent for the DSP since its interrupt routines can be
faster.
<br>
</p>
<p>Devices
<br>
<br>There are a total of four devices in the audio sub-system, each of
which are full duplex. In other words, we actually have four data
sources and four data receivers:
<br>
</p>
<pre>
Device      Data Source      Data Receiver
---------------------------------------------
DMA         DMA Playback      DMA Record
<a href="04010a.htm" target="UDOcon">Codec</a>       ADC               DAC
DSP         DSP Transmit      DSP Receive
External    Ext Input         Ext Output

</pre>
<p>These devices can be connected together in a very flexible manner
(as shown in the matrix under &quot;Connections&quot; earller in this
section). Each device has its own special characteristics, which are
described below.
<br>
<br>DMA Input
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The DMA input channel provides a fast path to system memory.
Briefly, it includes a 32 byte FIFO on the data path synchronized with
a memory addressing module which can fill memory in a linear,
continuous or looping mode. The maximum data transfer rate is about
one Megabyte per second.
<br>
</p>
<p>The data and clock signals to DMA input must be synchronized.
Source devices can send data to DMA input in either handshaked or
non-handshaked modes.
<br>
</p>
<p>In handshaked mode DMA Input must be the clock source. It uses a
gated clock technique to stop data transmission if its FIFO becomes
full.
<br>
</p>
<p>In non-handshaked mode, DMA input receives a clock from the
sending device. When its FIFO becomes half full it will attempt to
write it to memory. If it cannot get access to the system bus in time,
data will overflow.
<br>
</p>
<p>Non-handshaked mode to DMA input is provided simply because it
puts less burden on the sending device. However, when using it the
user must be careful to limit the data transfer rate to within system
bus bandwidth limits.
</p>
<p>DMA Output
<br>
<br>The DMA output channel provides a fast data channel from system
memory to sub-system devices. It also has its own 32 byte FIFO which
helps ensure that it can keep up with the real time response required
by certain devices (such as the <a href="04010a.htm" target="UDOcon">Codec</a> DACs). Data transfers can be
done in either handshaked or nonhandshaked modes. In handshaked mode a
gated clock technique is used together with a flag signal from the
receiving device to prevent overrnns or underruns.
<br>
</p>
<p>Non-handshaked mode is normally used for communication with DACs
or other real-time devices. If the system bus becomes overloaded for
any reason with higher priority bus masters data may be lost in
non-handshaked mode.
<br>
</p>
<p>As usual, the receiving device must be using the same clocks and
protocol as DMA output to ensure correct data transfer.
<br>
</p>
<p>Digital Signal Processer (DSP)
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The Atari Falcon030 includes a Motorola 56001 Digital Signal
Processor. This part offers the following features:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>
32 MHz operation, yields 96 MOPS.
1024 point complex FFT can be done in 2.07 imlliseconds.
24 bit internal and external data paths, yielding 144 dB dynamic range.
56 bit accumulators.

The following operations can be executed in parallel in one instruction
cycle:

24 x 24 multiply
56 bit addition
Two data moves
Two address pointer updates
Instruction prefetch
1024 x 24 bits of on chip RAM.
512 x 24 bits of on chip ROM used for Mu-Law, A-Law and four quadrant
Sine wave table data.

</pre>
<p>DSP Memory Map
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to the on-chip RAM and ROMs there are 32K words of
external, zero wait state SRAM. The memory map is conflgnred as
follows:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Program space is one contiguous block of 32K words.
<br>
</p>
<p>X and Y data space are each separate 16K word blocks. Both X and Y
can be accessed as blocks starting at 0 or 16K. Program space
physically overlaps both X and Y data spaces.
<br>
</p>
<p>Note that since program space overlaps X and Y space DSP software
must becareful to avoid having program and data memory corrupt each
other. Note that X:0, X:16K and P:16K are the same physical RAM
location, and that Y:0, Y:16K and P:0 are also at the same physical
RAM location.

<p><tt> SSI Interface </tt>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The Atari Falcon030 brings out the six wire SSI port to the
external DSP connector.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> Host Port </tt>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Interface with the 68030 host is via the 56001 host port (port B).
Data transfer by the host is via programmed I/O. In other words, the
DSP host port appears in the 68030 memory map as eight byte locations,
Data transfers by the host should always be conducted thruogh the
appropriate operating system calls (see the Atari Falcon030 software
developers guide). DSP software transfers data to and from the host
port in the usual way (see 56001 DSP Users Manual). The host can
interrupt the DSP and vice-versa.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> SCI </tt>
<br>
<br>The 56001 three wire SCI port is not implemented in the Atari
Falcon030. DSPsoftware must not rely on the existence of any of the
SCI registers, including the SCI timer, interrupts, or control and
status registers. Various versions of the Atari Falcon030 may or may
not even include the SCI circuitry!
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> DSP Expansion Port </tt>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>This DB26 female connector includes a variety of signals designed
primarily for the connection of digital sound devices and modems. It
can (and almost certainly will) be used for a number of other
appllcations such as low cost laser printers, video digitizers,
scanners and so forth.
<br>
</p>
<p>The pinout is as follows:

</pre>
<p>The signals on this port include several high speed clock and data
lines. It is therefore essential that developers use correct drive and
termination. In general, all signals should be terminated with a
ferrite bead followed by a 68ohm resistor in series. This is the same
type of termination used inside the Atari Falcon030 on all DSP port
signals. A ferrite bead should be chosen that does not begin cutoff
until 20MHz to 30MHz. Input signals from the peripheral should be
driven by CMOS devices such as 74HCxx or 74HCTxx.
<br>
</p>
<p>Total cable length should not exceed 24 inches and we strongly
advise the use of twisted pair cables.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> General Purpose Bits </tt>
<br>
<br>Three bits are provided for general control purposes. They can be
set, cleared or read as inputs through the operating system. At reset
these three lines are programmed as outputs and driven low by TOS.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> DSP SSI Interface </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>These six pins are the SSI port from the Motorola 56001 DSP chip.
The serial clock can operate up to one quarter of the 32 MHz DSP
master clock rate, or 8MHz. To use these pins to talk directly with
the DSP you need to take care to avoid contention with the
communication matrix by tri-stating the communication matrix outputs
through the appropriate OS call.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> External Serial Output channel </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>This three wire serial interface can be used to transfer data from
the host computer. It can transfer data from the DSP, DMA playback
channel, or on board analogne to digital convertor.
<br>
</p>
<p>Data transfers use either continuous mode or a handshaked (gated
clock) mode:
<br>
</p>
<pre>
Signal        Continuous          Handshaked
---------------------------------------------
XO_DATA        Output              Output
XO_CLK         Output              Output
XO_SYNC        Output              Input
---------------------------------------------

</pre>
<p>In either mode, data changes on fhe rising edge of the clock. Data
should be sampled on the falling edge of the clock.
<br>
</p>
<p>In Continuous mode there are 128 clock cycles per sample period.
XO_SYC will go high for the first 16 bits of a sample period and then
low for the remaining 96 bits. In each sample period a maximum of 8
tracks of 16 bit data can be transferred. Data words are transmitied
MSB first, end-on-end, with no gaps in between them. The number of
words per sample period is determined by the source device.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>A typical sample is shown below:
<br>
</p>

</pre>
<p>DATA &amp; SYNC change on rising edges of CLK &amp; should be

<br>
</p>
<p>In Handshaked mode XO_SYNC becomes an input. The external device
will pull XO-SYNC high, and if the source device is ready, XO_CLK will
become active for 16 cycles (or one word) together with XO_DATA.
XO_SYNC is sampled by the source device at the end of each word. If
XO_SYNC is high and another word is ready to be sent, XO_CLK and
XO_DATA will become active for another 16 cycles. A minimum of two
clock periods will always be inserted between data words.
<br>
</p>
<p>This gated clock technique will prevent overrun or underrun at
either end of the data paths:

<p><tt> External Serial Input Channel </tt>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>This three wire serial interface can be used to transfer data to
the host computer. It can transfer data to the DSP, DMA record
channel, or an on board digital to analogne convertor. Data transfers
use either conimuous mode or a handshaked (gated clock) mode:
<br>
</p>
<pre>
Signal      Continuous     Handshaked
---------------------------------------
XI_DATA       Input          Input
XI_CLK        Output         Output
XI_SYNC       Output         Input
---------------------------------------

</pre>
<p>In continuous mode it is the responsibdity of the external device
to synchronize to the XI_CLK and XI_SYNC outputs. Data should be
changed on the rising edges of XI_CLK since it will be sampled on the
falimg edges. XI_SYNC will identify the start of a frame by going high
for the first 16 clock cycles, and then low for the remaining 96
cycles. In handshaked mode the protocol is basically the same as for
the external serial output channel, except that XI_DATA is an input.
When the external device has no data to send it must pull XI_SYNC low
at least one clock cycle before the end of the previous sample.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> External Master clock </tt>
<br>
<br>This clock can optionally replace the internal 25.175 MHz or 32.0
MHz clocks. The maximum frequency allowable is 32 MHz.

<p>The Atari Falcon030 on board <a href="04010a.htm" target="UDOcon">Codec</a> is a high performance, 16 bit,
stereo device. It includes a stereo DAC and stereo ADC.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> 16-bit Stereo DAC </tt>
<br>
<br>The DAC output is directed to the on board loudspeaker (which can
optionally be turned off), to the monitor port (for monitors which
have loudspeakers built in, such as the SC1224), and the stereo
headphone jack on the back panel. DAC attenuation can be controlled
for lefl and right channels independently, through operating system
calls.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> Stereo Headphone Jack </tt>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The output port is a voltage drive with a peak voltage level of
3v, and an RMS level of 2v. It is designed for a peak load of 0.25W;
this means that the load should have an impedance greater than 32ohms.

</pre>
<p>To help compensate for the poor low-frequency response of
headphones and small speakers, the headphone amplifier has had a
bass-boost circuit added to it which adds about 6dB to the output
level, centered at 100Hz, dropping to a 0dB boost at 1KHz.
<br>
</p>
<p>The power level present at the headphones is dependent on the
level in theinput signal and the output impedance. If the input
(digital) value is assumed to be a 16-bit value scaled between +/-1,
then power level on theheadphones is:
<br>
</p>
<p>Vout = 3*IN
<br>Pout = [(3*IN)*(3*IN)]/XH
<br>Where XH is the headphone impedance. For example, for 32 ohm
headphones the peak output power is:
<br>Pout = 0.28 * [(INmax)*(INmax)]
<br>
</p>
<p>The output is AC coupled by a 47uF capacitor. This means that
there is a roll-off in the frequency response at low frequencies. The
cut-off point canbe approximated as:
<br>Fcut-off = 1/(2 * 3.14... *47uF *XH)
<br>
</p>
<p>Where XH is the impedance of the headphones. For example, with
32ohm headphones the cut-off is at 105Hz. Note that the headphone
output is a voltage. While the output is somewhat higher than normal
line levels, output attenuation in the <a href="04010a.htm" target="UDOcon">Codec</a> can reduce his without
loss of dynamic range. At the normal &quot;llne&quot; impedance of
600ohm, the cut-off frequency will be lower; other internal limits
keep the system to a cut-off of about 30Hz.
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> Internal Loudspeaker </tt>
<br>
<br>The internal speaker is driven from a boosted op-amp. It is
capable of output levels of 2v RMS (3.5v peak), and can drive loads as
low as 8ohm. This means that the RMS output level is 0.5W. Peak levels
will clip at 1.5W.
