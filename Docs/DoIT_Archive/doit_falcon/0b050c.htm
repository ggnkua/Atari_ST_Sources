<p>PLEASE, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PRINT ON PAPER THIS FILE, ASK YOU IF
YOU COULD NOT AVOID THAT ! READ THIS FILE ON THE SCREEN IN NORMAL CT2
MODE ! REDUCE THE PAPER CONSUMPTION OF THE PLANET ! THINK ABOUT OUR
PLANET FOR THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE (your children) AND THE
ANIMALS WHO NEED FORESTS, EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T NEED !
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>You have now in your hands the most polished item proposed for the
Falcon.
<br>
</p>
<p>The CENTurbo II took 18 months of conception, design, tests and
the 'know-how' of Rodolphe Czuba to finally achieve this goal which
many said would be impossible.
<br>
</p>
<p>Also, we would like to thank you for the confidence you had when
you bought this product. We're hoping this product will satisfy you
completely. We are open to any question, suggestion or remark that
could improve this product in any way possible. To contact the author
: rczuba@home.com
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>YOU MUST READ THIS !
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Skills required ? ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Read this documentation through to the end before starting
anything. This documentation has been written in such a way that the
hardest parts are first. So if you don't feel confident in doing it
yourself, don't even start. Just contact CENTEK to agree on the
shipping of your mother board and installation of your CENTurbo II.
ATTENTION: CENTEK's bill installation is at a fixed fee, no matter how
far you have started the installation! If once installed and have
checked your work several times, your Falcon still doesn't work,
CENTEK will have to decide, in all honesty, if the problem comes from
your first try or not. If it was from your side, a 400 FF fee (without
parts) can be requested in order to fix your Falcon. If any doubt
while reading the documentation, please use the CENTEK HOTLINE open
from 9 PM to 11 PM.

<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Precaution ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Many components of the CT2 are sensitive to static electricity:
avoid touching the card and especially the pins of the components and
connectors. Hold the card by the edges. Please make sure your body is
discharged of static electricity, example, touch a metallic object
that is in contact with the ground (faucet for example), the best
would be to touch a metal chassis (without paint) of an electrical
appliance connected to the ground (toaster for example). Be careful
with carpets and synthetic clothes... Don't walk barefoot on the
carpet.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Warranty ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The CENTurbo II is life time warranted. However CENTEK can reduce
or even cancel this warranty if the product hasn't been used or
handled correctly. NO solder is needed on the CT2 card for the
installation. There are however 2 solder joints on the forward left
corner of the card to connect a TURBO MODE LED if you have your Falcon
in a tower. Any solder work made on the CT2 other than the LED will
immediately cancel the warranty.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Tools ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>- Phillips screwdriver.
<br>- Thin flat pair of pliers.
<br>- Soldering iron, 30 to 40 Watts, with very thin tip and connected
to the ground(!) Make sure the outlet you use has a ground, and this
ground wire is really connected to the ground. If you don't own the
place, don't trust what you might see if you undo the cover of your
electrical outlet. You may destroy one or several chips of your
beloved Falcon if you use a soldering iron without ground. (except
some high end soldering iron equipped with an anti-static system).
<br>- Good tin solder, 60% tin and 40% lead.
<br>- Small utility knife with a new blade.
<br>- Thin pin.
<br>- Transparent adhesive (scotch-tape).
<br>- A centimeter ruler.
<br>- Something to make a hole (sharp scissors or a drill).
<br>And eventually:
<br>- Pair of pliers (very thin) to cut electric wires.
<br>- Pair of pliers to strip the wires insulation off.
<br>- For the FPU, a flat screwdriver very thin or PLCC extracting
pliers.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Orientation ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The instructions and other placement indications are to be
visualized and followed as if the mother board was in front of you, as
if you were using the computer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Undoing the Falcon ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Flip over the machine, undo the 7 screws from the case and the 3
long ones from the floppy drive. Flip the machine over again and
remove the case. Undo the power supply cover screws. Undo this cover.
Disconnect the floppy drive. Undo the 2 screws from the legs of the
power supply, then remove the power supply along with the connector.
Undo the screws of the cover remaining (all along the mother board),
you will then bend the little tips straight up in order to remove this
cover. Disconnect your memory card.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Preparing the mother board ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>If a CENTurbo I is installed, you need to remove it, as well as
all the wires connected to it. Some of the following procedures won't
need to be done since they were already done.
<br>
</p>
<p>With a cutter, remove the old CPU 68030 from the mainboard (see
figure to localise the CPU). BE CAREFULL to not touch the mainboard
and tracks with the cutter ! Use the border of the CPU case to guide
your cutter. Remove with the iron solderer the rest of the pins that
are yet on the mainboard's contacts. Verify, with a magnify if
possible, that there is no short-cuts between two contacts.
<br>
</p>
<p>With the thin cutting pliers or utility knife, cut then bend up
slightly the pins 3 and 4 of the ACIA 68B50 (U24) near the MIDI
sockets, same operation for the keyboard ACIA (U52) close to the left
of the keyboard connector.
<br>
</p>
<p>Locate the SDMA (U36) (hint: where the floppy drive was). Cut the
track that goes to the second (not number 2 !) pin of the SDMA (see
picture). On the right side of the track, scratch the varnish (2 mm
long) until you reach the metal, then tin it. Take the resistor of the
package and cut the pins at 5 mm from the body. Solder it between the
pin of the AJAX chip and the track of the SDMA like on the picture.
<br>
</p>
<p>Locate the DSP (U38) (hint: where the floppy drive was). Cut the
track that goes from the (big) hole far right of the 32MHz clock (U37)
(left of DSP) to the DSP. (see picture). The cut has to be as near as
possible of the hole, and the length has to be at least 1 mm. On the
right side of the track, scratch the varnish (2 mm long) then tin it.
<br>
</p>
<p>Locate the video chip 'VIDEL' (U34). Locate the pin 14, counting
to the left from the right back side. In front of this pin, there is a
metallic hole connected to this pin. With the tip of the utility
knife, scratch the varnish until you reach the metal, then tin it. Be
Careful with the videl.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you have a FPU installed in the falcon, you need to remove it.
If you don't have PLCC extracting pliers, use a small flat screwdriver
as lever on the 2 opposite corners of the socket.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you have an IDE disk drive, leave the ribbon cable on the
connector of the mother board. Count starting pin 1 (forward) and
locate the 23rd and the 25th wire (use a marker) of the ribbon cable
(falcon side). With your utility knife, separate the wire 23, and the
wire 25 from the others for about 2 cms long (starting from the
connector, falcon side). Cut those wires (23 and 25) as close as
possible to the connector. You need to strip the insulation of the
wire 23 and 25, then tin them. NEVER unconnect the ribbon cable from
the ribbon connector or your will have bad contacts!
<br>
</p>
<p>Cut as close as possible to the mother board the left pin of L102
which is located next to the <a href="040101.htm" target="UDOcon">NVRAM</a>. Bend it (see picture) and tin it.
<br>
</p>
<p>If it wasn't done already, remove the resistors or solder bridge
on R221 and R222 on the right side of the CPU (see picture). If there
is a solder bridge or there is no resistor on R216, you will need to
place one there (after removing the eventual bridge), using the one
furnished on this paper. Without this resistor on R216, the CT2B may
not work correctly ! Be carefull that the track around the R216 place
is not cut !
<br>
</p>
<p>Locate on the left side of the mother board the 2x8 contacts
referenced as U46. Unsolder the 4th contact (starting from the left)
and solder the 3rd contact (see picture).
<br>
</p>
<p>Remove from their sockets, the 4 chips 2x10 pins U62, U63, U67 and
U68 (towards you on the mother board). Those won't be used anymore.
Remove from its socket the chip 2x12 pins U44 (near the DSP) and break
the pin 15. Tin the pin 15 of the socket (be careful with the
plastic).
<br>
</p>
<p>With the black wire, cut 2 small wires of 2 cm.
<br>Solder one wire from pin 2 to pin 17 of U62.
<br>Solder the other wire from pin 8 to pin 17 of U63.
<br>
</p>
<p>Install the switch on the left side of the Falcon case between the
cartridge port and enhanced joystick ports. To do so, make a 6mm
diameter hole (scissors or drill). Position the switch in such a way
that it will switch from HIGH or LOW (vertical way).
<br>
</p>
<p>Solder a short pin of a 33 ohms 1/4 W resistor
(orange/orange/black/gold) in the right hole of U37, the place of the
DSP 32 MHz oscillator (see the DSP figure). Cut the other pin of the
resistor as short as possible and solder a thin wire (black wire
furnished in the last packages only) between this pin and the hole of
the pin nr14 of the VIDEL. This wire MUST be as short as possible,
straight, and not in contact with the mainboard ! Use the forward
plastic border of the mainboard floppy connector to fix the wire in
the best straight position. Software remark : you should turn always
OFF the 'External clock' setting in the set-up F7, when using the CT2.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Ribbon cable ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Place the ribbon cable on a piece of a hard cardboard, and
separate using the utility knife the wires until the connector. Then
cut the wires at the length required (as shown on the diagram), strip
the insulation of the wires (2mm) except the ACIA wires (4mm). Twist
them together then tin them.
<br>
</p>
<p>You then need to solder the 16 wires of this ribbon cable starting
by wire n1, finishing by the wire n16. Some wires will need to be
secured on the mother board with some adhesive tape. Be careful in not
having wires crossing (especially near the connector), the ideal would
be to have all the wires parallel to each others.
<br>
</p>
<p>FOLLOW THESE RULES:
<br>- Don't EVER make a loop with a wire like for example going around
a component's leg.
<br>- Don't cross together the wires anywhere - VERY IMPORTANT ! -
<br>- The wires MUST be separated on all the longer of the ribbon.
<br>Stay as straight as possible and keep the most important distance
between each wires: a wire disturbs the others and is disturbed by the
others (Electro Magnetical Interferences = EMI).
<br>- Don't put a wire over a chip: the activity of the chip will
disturb the signal of this wire !
<br>
<br>Solder:
<br>- the wires n1 (A) on the pin 13 of U62.
<br>- the wire n2 (E) on the pin 6 of U62.
<br>- the wire n4 (MB) on the motherboard: the pin left of the L102
placement (and not the pin of L102 that is bent up).
<br>- the wire n5 (SWG) on the superior pin of the switch.
<br>- the wire n6 (L102) on the left pin of L102 (see picture).
<br>- the wire n7 (SWS) on the middle pin of the switch.
<br>- the wire n8 (AK) on the pin 3 and 4 of the keyboard ACIA.
<br>- the wire n9 (AM) on the pin 3 and 4 of the MIDI ACIA. - the wire
n10 (U44) on the pin 15 of U44 socket (NOT the chip). Break the pin 15
of the chip U44, and insert it back on its socket.
<br>- the wire n11 (DSP) on the cut track going to the DSP.
<br>- the wire n12 (SDMA) on the cut track and resistor connection
near the SDMA (see picture).
<br>- the wire n14 (+12) on the front pin of R178 (see picture).
<br>- the wire n15 (IW) with the wire n23 of the IDE cable (the one
that goes to the peripheral).
<br>- the wire n16 (IR) with the wire n25 of the IDE cable (the one
that goes to the peripheral).
<br>
<br>Remove the jumper of the mother board bus.
<br>Put the power supply unit back in and remove the srew on the right
forward corner that fix the supply PCB on the metal bracket (the
heatsink/fan module of the CT2 will need place).
<br>
</p>
<p>Before inserting your FPU in the CT2 FPU socket, check its speed
written on the chip (68882FNxx). The following versions react
differently at 50MHz:
<br>- 16/20 MHz: Doesn't work at 50 MHz !
<br>- 25 MHz: Not recommended...
<br>- 33 MHz: No problem what so ever at 50 MHz.
<br>Be careful when inserting the FPU, the pin 1 has to be in the
center of the right side. ONLY IF the pin 11 of your 'old' FPU is
raised, don't try to move it (it may break). Use the small squared pad
on the CT2 just near the socket. You have only to use a 1 cm wire
(from the black wire) between this pad and the raised pin 11 of the
FPU.
<br>
</p>
<p>You now need to insert the CT2 on the Falcon bus. For this you
need to place the card over the bus first to see if it is aligned
correctly. Then apply an equal pressure with your left thumb on the
solders of the left female connector and your right thumb on right
female connector in order to fully insert the CT2. Attention: don't
apply pressure on any of the CT2 components. Insert the connector of
the ribbon cable in the right side of the CT2. Insert, if not done
already, the SIMM in the socket.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you have the gray ATARI VGA adaptor and if you don't have a
multisync monitor, some extended video modes with the external clock
at 32 MHz won't be possible without modifying this adaptor (which is
bugged !). You need to flip it and cut with the utility knife into the
plastic, a 1cm wide strip on the whole length and at 4mm of the
metallic border. After this you can access the inside, you separate
the pin 15 from the pins 11 and 19. Move aside the 2 wires connected
to pin 15, cut them as close as possible to the pin and connected them
together. If you don't want to do this hack, you can get 2 DB19 (male
and female) that you will solder (direct cabling) without connecting
the pin 15 (cut them). This little adaptor will be inserted between
the Falcon VGA port and the gray ATARI VGA adaptor.
<br>
</p>
<p>The installation is done. Put the machine back together and boot
it with the switch on the LOW position (NORMAL mode). If the computer
works, copy on your hard drive the file from the installation floppy,
then decompress it. Then, flip the switch (TURBO mode) and press the
RESET:
<br>- you should boot into a blue page, then a menu should appear.
<br>- Press F7 and verify your FAST-Ram and your eventual FPU are well
detected.
<br>- Verify the delay about the IDE is set. If your IDE HDD is slow,
the access without this delay may crash (if a software like XBOOT
writes, your bootable partition may be crashed !).
<br>- Continue to boot by pressing the ESC key.
<br>
<br>** There are some other important setting you have to know : **
<br>** YOU MUST READ the file 'SOFTWARE.TXT'. **
<br>
<br>If you have a SCSI hard disk, run 'CC_TOOLS' (from the CECILE
folder) to test 'transfer consistency'. If the software reported some
transfers errors, read the 'software' documentation about the
SCSI/<a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a> setting !
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> ** Thermic aspects ** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The CT2 are equipped with heatsink + fan, stuck to the CPU with
thermical cyanoacrylate glue. Don't try to remove this block or you
will damage the CPU ! This block has been glued in a position that
won't bother the keyboard (if still using the original case). An 3 1/2
inch IDE hard drive will remain between the power supply unit and the
floppy drive, but far behind and along the CT2 heat dissipater. If you
have a 2 1/2 inch IDE HDD (65, 80 or other capacity), you have to cut
the left forward pin of the metal bracket and remove the four screws
(two on each side of the HDD). Then screw again the bracket on the
motherboard and stick (double-faced adhesive or glue) the HDD on the
bracket at the far behind position.
<br>
</p>
<p>ATTENTION: if using the original Falcon case, it is necessary to
keep the motherboard fan running.. If you think it is still too noisy,
you can reduce its speed in adding a 47 Ohms resistor in the red wire.
<br>
</p>
<p>We even recommend (sometimes really needed) to add a third fan
which will expel the hot air from the casing out. This fan has to be
installed near the power supply unit, which is one of the first reason
of this hot air. The ideal would be to cut the shape in the case then
glue it on the left side. Or another solution, faster but not as
efficient, place the 3rd fan between the power supply unit and the top
case. Never put some objects like papers on the top case !
<br>

<br>DOCUMENTATION OF THE CT2
<br>
<br>February 2000 - Rodolphe Czuba
<br>
<br>
</div>
<p>PLEASE, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PRINT ON PAPER THIS FILE, ASK YOU IF
YOU COULD NOT AVOID THAT ! READ THIS FILE ON THE SCREEN IN NORMAL CT2
MODE ! REDUCE THE PAPER CONSUMPTION OF THE PLANET ! THINK ABOUT OUR
PLANET FOR THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE (your children) AND THE
ANIMALS WHO NEED FORESTS, EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T NEED !
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>IMPORTANT
<br>Don't ask assistance from us if you don't read this !
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Material overview : </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The CT2 offers two modes: NORMAL and TURBO. The NORMAL mode
permits to keep a Falcon 100% as origin, except that the DSP IRQ is
not wired (see below).
<br>
</p>
<p>The small following chart gives features (in MHz) of the 2 modes.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>
              NORMAL          TURBO

CPU             16              50
BUS             16              50
FPU             32              50
DSP             32              50
Fast-RAM        no              50
VIDEL (Int)     32              50
VIDEL (Ext)     32              32    (with hardware fitting last manual)
</pre>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The CT2 contains what is called 'the DMA' modification destined to
CUBASE AUDIO. This last works perfectly in TURBO mode !
<br>
</p>
<p>The TURBO mode is possible in VGA resolution, but also in RVB and
MONO ST (SM12x/144) thanks to the attendance of a 32 MHz clock on the
EXT entrance of VIDEL, the SETUP being in charge of commuting the
VIDEL on this External clock after having detected a RVB screen or
SM124. It is possible to DISABLE this External clock from the SETUP if
you are in TURBO and with a small software in the AUTO directory if
you are in NORMAL mode (EXCLKOFF.PRG).
<br>
</p>
<p>Two things differentiate a Falcon from an another with a CT 2 in
NORMAL mode :
<br>
<br>
<br>- the interruption coming from the DSP is not wired and can block
a program using it. To use this rare kind of software you need to put
a patch (DSP_IRQ.PRG) in the AUTO directory (behind your debugger if
you use one!). In this mode, do not forget to remove wait-states on
the DSP in the F7 set up.
<br>
<br>- the coprocessor is 32-bit wired (16-bit on basic Falcon) and it
run up to 32 MHz (instead 16 MHz on basic Falcon) -&gt; about 15 %
better.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Software overview : </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>On the CENTurbo II, it is possible to start several ways:
<br>
</p>
<p>- NORMAL mode.
<br>- TURBO mode under TOS 7.0x
<br>- TURBO mode under TOS 4.0x
<br>
</p>
<p>(x means 1,2 or 4 according to your TOS)
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> *** NORMAL mode *** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>In this mode, you keep an original boring slow Falcon...
<br>
</p>
<p><b> *** TURBO mode under TOS 7.0x *** </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>It is the standart CT2 TURBO mode. You have to use it if you want
to boost your Falcon !
<br>
</p>
<p>This is a TOS 4 (don't be afraid by the number 7 !) that was
modified to correct some errors of the original TOS, install the
FAST-RAM and propose some options via the set up. The available
options in the SETUP are taken in account in the launching of this
one.
<br>
</p>
<p>With this boot, the FAST-Ram is declared to the system, the TOS is
copied in Fast-Ram, the keyboard reset works ( as well cold or warm
boot ).
<br>
</p>
<p>The boot is made with the internal driver (Cecile) or external (if
it works in turbo!). The boot looks first for a bootable hard drive in
the order declared under the setup. Then, 2 cases are available with
Cecile or external.
<br>
</p>
<p>With the internal Cecile, the boot looks on the partition started
for a possible CECILE.SYS that contains some complementary information
(boot partition, energy economy mode, speed...) and start the system.
If there is not started partition, the boot is made on the value in
the setup (that can take time!).
<br>
</p>
<p>In the case of an external driver that works and reachable by the
system (beware of big capacitie SCSI disks ), the boot partition is
validated by this driver and the boot will be made on it.
<br>
</p>
<p>with this mode, you can really start on the partition of your
choice with the original desktop.
<br>
</p>
<p>It is necessary to possess a graphic accelerator (NVDI, MAGIC,...)
to run the system. Modifications brought to the TOS 4.0x to make a TOS
7.0x don't go until the integration of all graphic routines without
the utilization of the Blitter. YOU NEED NVDI (2.5, 4.11 or 5.x) or
MAGIC to use FAST-RAM !
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br><b> *** TURBO mode under TOS 4.0x *** </b>
</p>
<p>This mode is dummy and only for testing some curious softwares !
Don't use it for regular use of the Falcon (or you were stupid to buy
a CT2 !) : there is no FAST-RAM, even if the ram test sequence
indicates a 'dummy' not physical FAST-RAM that is coming in reality
from ST-ram ! In this mode the speed is very slow if compared with the
TOS 7 (FAST-Ram)!
<br>
</p>
<p>In this mode the setup is available but doesn't permit to select
the options that are available in the TOS 7.0x. The only available
option is the choice of the TOS 4.0x launching.
<br>
</p>
<p>Under TOS 4.0x, THERE IS NO ACCESS TO THE FAST-Ram and the reset
blocks the machine because the TOS can't start in Turbo : it is
necessary to make a hard reset (push the button) to start again the
machine.
<br>
</p>
<p>Note that TOS 4 mode allows you to use the Falcon without the NVDI
or MAGIC (so , WITH the BLITTER ON) because there is no Physical
FAST-RAM. In this manner you have time to find a NVDI or MAGIC...

</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Configuration of the CT2</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In the beginning you MUST BE in NORMAL mode. The following step is
OBLIGATORY before switching in Turbo.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>- Execute CBOOT.APP, reset the <a href="040101.htm" target="UDOcon">NVRAM</a> (right icon) except if you
got the CRC message mistake, reset the various options and validate
when leaving. NOTE: think to select your country for keyboard and
desktop and to make a back-up boot on a disk.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The SETUP.TXT file suplly informations complete on the
configuration.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>External software</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>* AUTO directory
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If you use XBOOT, it is necessary to configure it with only the
FastLoad bit (see FILEINFO.CPX) because it uses the blitter.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Activate your graphic accelerator for the TOS 7 mode (NVDI for
example). During the progress of the file AUTO, the only graphic exit
is the text that is transferred from the ROM to the Chip-Ram,
therefore that works with the Blitter, fortunately.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Here the order to respect. All programms are not allowed to run
together: this is only a list...
<br>

<br>- NOSYSTEM
<br>- RDEBUG
<br>- CENTINEL
<br>- DSP_IRQ
<br>- MINT
<br>
<br>
<br>* CPX
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It is necessary to put FGENERAL.CPX INEVITABLY in the CPX
directory and DISABLE the BLITTER (and save the configuration). It is
recommended to validate it resident thanks to CONFIG.CPX.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>FILEINFO.CPX is an utility permitting to adjust 3 bits of program
configurations and accessories: FastLoad, TT-Ram (Mem) and TT-Ram
(Prg). The FastLoad bit prevents the system to erase all the memory to
every launching of the software, that can take time with 32 Mo of
Fast-Ram (1 to 2 seconds). The TT-Ram bit (PRG) loads the program in
Fast-Ram, attention to the software audio and video (by example :
CUBASE AUDIO will not output sounds if the PRG bit is set ! But you
should set the MEM bit). The TT-Ram bit (MEM) fact that the program
will make this al (!nl)lowances memory in Fast-Ram, same remark for
the program.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>* ACCESSORIES
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Install XCONTROL.ACC, otherwise the FGENERAL.CPX will never be
activated.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Install CBOOT if you want to reset material options without
needing to go back by the CT2's setup. These options are active after
validation of CBOOT.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>* CECILE
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Keep in mind that CECILE was developed especially for the high
speed of the CT2 and that we cannot warranty the other drivers to run
perfectly in TURBO mode ! So, it is strongly recommended to use CECILE
by selecting 'CECILE' in the F10 menu of the CT2. Cecile is compatible
with CUBASE and MAGIC (by example...).
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Our experience showed us that AHDI, ICD and SCSITOOLS (HUSHI) are
be avoid if you don't want to loose a partition on your HDD ! The case
of <a href="1302.htm" target="UDOcon">HDDriver</a> is different : some version are running and other versions
are not running in some conditions. The versions before the 7.60 are
to be avoid because the 7.60 was the official version for the Milan
(the 25 MHz 040 gives the same problems than the 50 MHz 030 of the CT2
: the internal routs are too speed and the HD accesses timings are too
short/quick !! Keep in mind that this means a bad writing could occur
and crash, by example, the directory and/or FAT of a partition of your
Hard Disk !
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The better solution is to install CECILE on the boot partition of
your HD and to use the internal CECILE on the FLASH when in turbo
mode. Launch CC-TOOLS.APP in the CECILE folder to install CECILE. If
you have booted in normal mode with an other driver than CECILE, you
should launch CECILE.PRG before launching CC-TOOLS. Don't be afraid by
the fact there is no more files in the window of your partition :
press ESC to update the system ! It is caused by the launch of CECILE
out of the AUTO folder.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>At this step you have to know that there is 3 speed steps into the
CECILE.SYS driver. By default, the speed is 1. These 3 speeds are
different timings to access the slowest (old) to the fastest (modern)
hard drives. This speed selection is only for IDE HD. It has no matter
with SCSI HD (timings are done by the SCSI controller (53C80)).
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>When the installation of the driver is done, reboot the computer
in normal mode : the HD must boot.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In TURBO mode, you will have to carefully try the higher speeds (2
&amp; 3). Firstly, try only the read accesses (not dangerous !). To
try the write accesses, use a configuration without X-boot or all
other programs that write when booting up to the desktop... In the
desktop launch the CC-TOOLS test, and finally, transfert a big ZIP
file (about 1 MB) from a partition to an other and check the zip
destination. If there is at least one error, your HD has problem to
read and/or write at the speed you have selected. Go down back. With
all modern and fast HD (QUANTUM FIREBALL by exemple) the speed can be
used at 3 in read and write to have the best data rate performances...
Remember to always reboot after a change of the speed into CECILE.SYS
or your tests are dummy.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>There is too an IDE hardware setting in the F7 menu of the CT2.
This one is to add hardware wait states on IDE transferts. It is set
by default, but you have to remove it if the HD is modern and/or you
successed in the previous test in speed 3.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In the all cases, you can try all combinations if there is no
write on the HD.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;

</p>
<p><b> PATCHES for SOFTWARE </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>We kindly furnish some patchs for software that had problems to
run with CT2 (especially because of the speed with the FAST-Ram).
<br>
</p>
<p>You should read the documentation in the 'PATCHS' folder.
<br>It is a necessity, by example, for CUBASE AUDIO 2.04/2.06 and
MAGIC 5 or 6. Be carefull : when Cubase is patched, it is impossible
to run it in NORMAL mode : keep a copy of the folder with a sightly
different name to use both in Normal and Turbo mode (but you should
not need to run something in Normal mode !).
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> SCSI transferts / AUDIO setting </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>When the Turbo mode is running you have to check the SCSI
transferts. It is the same procedure than with IDE HD. Firstly use
CC-TOOLS to test. After, check a copied big ZIPped file (at least 5
MBytes) from the IDE to the SCSI in 640*480 TRUE COLOR mode (important
to respect this configuration : CENTscreen is already installed !). If
there is no error, you can think that the SCSI is OK.
<br>
</p>
<p>If not, be sure that the SCSI chain is correctly set :
<br>Do you know the RULE for SCSI ?
<br>You MUST put a terminator on the LAST PHYSICAL peripheral of the
chain. All the other peripherals MUST NOT have terminator ! There is
only one way to be sure of that : open the box and check the
terminator strap/setting on the electronical boards or behind the
peripherals like <a href="0701.htm" target="UDOcon">CD-ROM</a>.
<br>
</p>
<p>Follow this point seriously because a major part of the vendors
don't know the SCSI rules and install SCSI material inside case/box
without to remove the original terminator on the peripheral. If there
is more than the chain's end terminator, the data transferts could be
altered even if they were good in normal mode several months ago !
<br>
</p>
<p>The AUDIO quality has to be listen : check for crackles with
official good software (not demos or stupid mod players that may badly
programmed !).
<br>
</p>
<p>If you have problems with SCSI and/or AUDIO, you have now to
modify a hardware setting ON the CT2 :
<br>
</p>
<p>There is 4 squared pads before the CPU of the CT2 just between 2
small 14 pins chips. The 2 left pads are connected together by a very
small track. You have to cut this track and put a solder jumper on the
two right pads. You have now a new SDMA timing and have to do again
all the SCSI and AUDIO tests.
<br>
</p>
<p>Note that this modification and the add of a HE14 connector on the
left forward corner of the CT2 to light a panel led, are the only ones
that cannot cancel the warranty.
<br>
</p>
<p>If the problem stills to be, please contact Rodolphe Czuba :
<br>rczuba@free.fr or visit www.czuba-tech.com
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Compatibility </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The list of software tested here is not exhaustive. If a software
is not present, it is sufficient to know some rules to know if it will
be capable to work under the aforementioned modes.
<br>
</p>
<p>First of all It is necessary to distinguish software that function
on all TOS (and therefore on all Atari) and those specific to the
Falcon.
<br>
</p>
<p>In the first case, the most work if they respect the elementary
rules of programming (using only system functions!).
<br>
</p>
<p>We can also distinguish software functioning on the TT, because
they are almost-guaranteed to work under TOS 7.0x.
<br>
</p>
<p>In case of doubts, it only needs to know if it runs normally on TT
or Falcon before going farther.
<br>
</p>
<p>As for software functioning on Falcon, the main problem will come
from the few of consideration of the system. Some software audio not
having already foreseen to function on something else than a basis
Falcon (without turbo), there won't be a miracle on an as fast board
as the CT2. The second big problem, is the management of the FAST-Ram.
If no distinction is made, we can be in front of a screen in Fast-Ram
that won't be seen, or AUDIO buffers giving the same problem than the
graphic routines of the TOS with the Blitter. You're driving to a
system crash...
<br>
</p>
<p>Be careful not to abuse the passage of all the programs in
Fast-Ram. May be they are already well configured !
<br>
</p>
<p>The last point it is the acceleration of the CPU in relation to
the DSP that can bring problems to software conceived on a too much
tighten timing (Basis Falcon).
<br>

<p><b> FAQ - Frequently Asking Questions </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Here are some questions that you can put yourselves (especially if
you didn't read the DOC! ). Let's recall that the reading of the
documentation is INDISPENSABLE ...It will make you win a lot of times
and will prevent you from putting your configuration upside down. (And
especially that permits us to do not still answer to the same
questions!)
<br>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Q1</b>.</dt><dd> My computer does'nt boot in normal mode (black screen) and crash
when I come out of the setup in TURBO mode.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A1.</b></dt><dd> You have a hardware problem on your machine :
<br>- the ROM case is not in its support or is fitted badly.
<br>- the CT2 is badly fitted...
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q2.</b></dt><dd> I don't have icons and text in XBOOT.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A2.</b></dt><dd> WARNING , XBOOT is installed in FASTRAM whereas he doesn't know
how to manage it. Don't leave XBOOT, don't save anything and REBOOT.
To use again XBOOT, you must remove him bits of FAST RAM, with the
help of the CPX FileInfo for example.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q3.</b></dt><dd> With an IDE hard disk boot, the computer crashes during the file
auto init or before arriving to the desktop.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A3.</b></dt><dd> The ATA speed controlled in c*cile doesn't fit to this hard
drive. To modify this speed, use &quot; ATA &quot; options of CECILE.
The speed 3 only works with the most modern Disks. Try speed 1 for an
old hard drive. Use the option Wait State even in the SETUP to slow
down the access to the IDE port. You still have again 3 speed settings
avalaible. Most of the time, a too fast or too slow speed provokes
problems. Look for the speed that corresponds to your disk.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q4.</b></dt><dd> I don't have icons/ or scrambled icons on the desktop. It even
happens to crash while scrolling a menu.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A4.</b></dt><dd> The blitter is active and try to use the FAST RAM what it cannot
MAKE. You must disable the blitter to remedy this problem. Use
FGENERAL and select &quot; BUFFER YES &quot;.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q5.</b></dt><dd> I can't disable the blitter, it reactivates itself.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A5.</b></dt><dd> The CPX SI (SYSTEM INFO) reactivates the blitter systematically.
Suppress this CPX.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q6.</b></dt><dd> Magic doesn't start.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A6.</b></dt><dd> You need to patch it.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q7.</b></dt><dd> Magic stops on a white screen.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A7.</b></dt><dd> It seems to be a current bug of MAGIC. Make a hot RESET
(CONTROL-ALTERNATE-DELETE on the keyboard).
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q8.</b></dt><dd> Calamus crashes in 256 colors with FALCON8.PRG enable.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A8.</b></dt><dd> Vous must use FALCT2_8.PRG instead of FALCON8.PRG.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q9.</b></dt><dd> Cubase crashes (format error).
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A9.</b></dt><dd> You must replace the MROS of Cubase by our patched version.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q10.</b></dt><dd> Aniplayer or Quincy or a software using the DSP stay frozen.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A10.</b></dt><dd> You must have the DSP-IRQ.PRG program in the AUTO file.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q11.</b></dt><dd> A software using the coprocessor crashes in FAST RAM. Besides
calculations to the coprocessor are wrong (Pentium syndrome ).
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A11.</b></dt><dd> Contact us...
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q12.</b></dt><dd> I boot on my external SCSI hard drive instead of my internal IDE.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A12.</b></dt><dd> Your IDE disk doesn't have started partition whereas the SCSI has
a started partition. It is therefore this last one that will boot.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q13.</b></dt><dd> My Quantum MAVERICK hard drive is seen during the ID test , but a
crash occurs just after.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A13.</b></dt><dd> This hard drive doesn't know how to transmit its parameters to
CECILE. In the F10-CECILE menu of the setup choose CHS for the &quot;
mode-IDE-master &quot; instead of AUTO.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q14.</b></dt><dd> From the moment I passed from a CT1 to the CT2, my FALCON crashes
inopportunely in normal AND in turbo mode.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A14</b>.</dt><dd> Check that the resistance of 1.2K present on the network P12 (1
cm behind the CPU of the motherboard) and that was indispensable on
CT1 has been withdrawn to upgrade to the CT2.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q15.</b></dt><dd> From the moment I made a keyboard adapter, my FALCON reboots
inopportunely or my keyboard is crazy during the boot or I have a
black screen during the boot When I disconnect the keyboard, the boot
is normally.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A15.</b></dt><dd> Look carefully the adapter, the cable is probably too long.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q16.</b></dt><dd> In turbo mode, the IDE disk doesn't boot in external boot or in
T.OS 4 or under MagiC.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A16a</b></dt><dd> The IDE disk doesn't work with routines of the TOS or those of
MagiC. It is necessary to change hard drive. While waiting, it is
necessary to remove the boot on the IDE and to put one on the external
SCSI. In this case, the boot on an external driver will find, without
crashing, the driver and will continue the boot on the selected drive.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A16b.</b></dt><dd> Check that the external driver works correctly in turbo mode with
this IDE disk. To make the test, it is necessary to start with
internal C*cile and to launch the driver once under the desktop. You
just need to use your machine to see if everything works fine,
especially the IDE.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Q17.</b></dt><dd> The boot with the internal C*cile doesn't work anymore after
having put a CECILE.SYS on the boot partition.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>A17.</b></dt><dd> Check in normal mode if the ATA settings are correct.
<br>&nbsp;
