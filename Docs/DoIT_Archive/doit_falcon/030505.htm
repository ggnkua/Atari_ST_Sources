<p><b>WELCOME! </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>There are lots of things you can do with the new Atari desktops
(and with the old ones!); almost as much as with a replacement desktop
like NeoDesk&#153; from Gribnif Software! Unfortunately, the manuals
Atari gives us with the computers don't tell you about all of these
great features. I will try to rectify this deficiency.
<br>
</p>
<p>I have compiled as much information on the NEWDESK.INF file that I
could, and thrown in some info on TOS 2.06. This file focuses on
Atari's NEWDESK.INF file, and in particular on TOS 2.06, since they
are what I have. If you don't have TOS 2.06, don't worry; most of the
really useful info in here is applicable to *all* versions of TOS, and
some info specific to TOS 4.0x is included, too. I have tried to point
out where information may be specific only to certain versions of TOS.
With this as a reference, you should be able to modify your
DESKTOP/NEWDESK.INF file to do almost anything with your desktop!
<br>
</p>
<p>I have learned all of this partly through trial and error, and
partly through discussions on online services. A lot of the
information came to me by way of the NEWDESK topic on GEnie in the
Atari Roundtable. GEnie, by the way, is an excellent source of
information and support for the Atari line of computers; being the
only official online Atari service, there are more Atarians there than
anywhere else. I highly recommend this service. I suppose I should
state that I have no connection with GEnie other than as a satisfied
user. Another excellent source of info and programs is the <a href="15.htm" target="UDOcon">Internet</a>,
where Atarians from all over the world can (and do!) converse and
share programs.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you find that something is wrong, please let me know! If you
see something I missed, or if you think I should include some
information that isn't in here, let me know that, too. And of course,
suggestions are always welcome. When contacting me, include your
machine type, TOS, GEM, AES, <a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a>, and MultiTOS versions (whichever
apply). This will help me decipher different, unknown parameters. If
you don't know some of this information or don't have <a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a> or
something, don't let that stop you from contacting me! But please, try
to include at least the TOS version (TOS date will suffice, if
necessary; just give me the copyright dates in the &quot;Desktop
Info...&quot; menu). Also include your name and some way that I can
get in touch with you, such as email address or postal address.

<p><b> DESKTOP/NEWDESK BASICS </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The DESKTOP.INF and NEWDESK.INF files in Atari computers contain
all the information your computer needs to configure itself. It
contains all the names, positions and (for appropriate TOS versions)
icon numbers for your desktop icons. It stores all the info on
Installed Apps, desktop icons, and window positions (even for windows
that have been closed!). If you leave a window open when saving the
desktop, the location, current directory, and file mask (for those
versions of TOS that support masks) are saved. It stores info on
whether or not the key click and system bell are turned on, the repeat
rate for key clicks, mouse double click rate and tracking rate,
current resolution, keyboard shortcuts for menu items (in TOS &gt;=
2.0x), and lots more. In short, it stores every peice of information
that you can configure from the desktop or the standard Atari Control
Panel.
<br>
</p>
<p>When you boot up your machine, the computer loads in auto programs
and then reads the DESKTOP/NEWDESK.INF (hereafter referred to
collectively as simply &quot;INF&quot;) file for information on
resolution, windows, etc. If you have Atari's Control Panel (or a
replacement), the key repeat rate, printer and serial port
configuration, and other information is also loaded from the INF file
and configured.
<br>
</p>
<p>To change the INF file, you need simply alter a setting from
either the Control Panel (not the extensible control panel, however)
or one of the desktop menus, and then select &quot;Save Desktop.&quot;
If you do this several times and display the INF file after each save,
you will get a feel for which changes to the desktop correspond to
changes in the INF file. Before doing this, of course, make a backup
of your original INF file by renaming it to DESKTOP.INX. This way if
you somehow &quot;break&quot; the INF file, you can always be sure to
have a working one handy.
<br>
</p>
<p>You can view the file directly from the desktop; the INF file is
simply an ASCII file! This means that not only is everything in the
file plainly visible from the desktop, but you can load it into just
about any word processor, text editor, or DTP program and edit it by
hand. This has the advantage of allowing you to make certain changes
that the desktop doesn't allow for. If you're really familiar with the
INF file, you can also make multiple changes in much less time than it
would take you from the desktop. The editor, however, must be able to
load and save files in ASCII format, and it must not strip trailing
spaces from lines (more on this in a moment).
<br>
</p>
<p>One important bit of information to know and understand when
editing the INF file is how TOS reads and applies the information in
it. Not surprisingly, the INF file acts as a filter, through which TOS
sifts programs and files to apply various actions (running files,
assigning icons, etc.). What *is* surprising is that these filters
work in reverse order from what you see in the INF file. The *last*
entry in the INF file is the *first* filter applied! The way this
works is as follows:
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>For icon assignments, TOS reads from the end of the file to the
beginning, comparing each file in a directory to each filter (icon
assignment) until a match is found. When TOS finds a match, it moves
on to the next file. So if you have a program SQUISHII.APP, and assign
an icon to it, that assignment should go toward the end of the file,
that way it will be filtered out early on. If you have an icon
assingment like #I xx xx xxx @ *.*@ @ *below* the assignment for
SQUISHII.APP, then SQUISHII.APP will be filtered out at the *.* (and
assigned that icon) rather than at #I xx xx xxx @ SQUISHII.APP@ @ .
Hence, you would never see the special icon you assigned to
SQUISHII.APP. This is important to understand, for two reasons. The
first is that when editing the INF file, you want to work down the
file from most general to most specific; getting this order wrong will
give you results other than what you wanted. The other reason is that
when you make an icon assignment from the desktop, it is saved at the
end of the INF file. If you were to make lots of assignments, then do
a generic (*.*) icon assignment, all your files would use the generic
icon (until you edited the INF file to have *.* be the last filter
applied).
<br>
</p>
<p>For program assignments, TOS reads the INF file in the same way as
for icons, and applies filters in the same way. When you double click
on a file (whether it's executable or not), TOS starts looking for
matches from the bottom of the INF file and works its way to the top.
If you were to install a program VIEWER.APP for file type *.*, this
assignment would be saved at the end to the INF file, and hence be the
first filter TOS saw; all files, no matter what type they were, would
cause VIEWER.APP to run and they would be loaded in to it. This is
true even for PRGs, APPs, TOSs, etc.; in the INF file, these are just
treated as applications installed with no file type. As with icons, if
you edit the INF file make sure you work from most general at the top
of the INF file to most specific at the bottom.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> EDITING THE INF FILE </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Before you begin editing your INF file, make sure that you have a
backup of you current, working version! It is possible (and fairly
easy, really) to change the INF file so that the computer will become
&quot;confused&quot; and not boot!
<br>
</p>
<p>Probably the first thing to remember when editing your INF file is
that NEWDESK.INF can't be larger than 4kb (4096 bytes), and starts
causing trouble with the system around 3900 bytes. Similarly, the
DESKICON.RSC can only be 64kb (65536 bytes). The newer DESKCICN.RSC
(the color icon resource for TOS 4.0x and up) can be larger than this,
though I don't know if there is a limit. If you try to exceed the
limit, you'll get &quot;Out Of Memory&quot; errors and lots of
headaches.
<br>
</p>
<p>On earlier versions of TOS (less than 2.0x), the limit on
DESKTOP.INF is even more restrictive; it can't be larger than 1kb
(1024 bytes)! However, you also don't have a lot of icon assignments
eating up that space, so it's a fair trade.
<br>
</p>
<p>One excellent way around this is to have a directory full of
different INF files; a specific one for each task. If you put only
those application and icon assignments necessary for a particular
task, you should have no problem avoiding the size limit. To switch
between INF files, then you can just install either Charles F
Johnson's shareware product Desk Switch 1.1 or Klaus Pederson's public
domain Load Inf as the application for file types of *.INF. That way,
when you want to change to a different task, just double click on the
appropriate INF file, and away you go with all the key assignments,
installed apps, desktop icons, and icon assignments you want for that
task.
<br>
</p>
<p>Another way around this is to get a program like GEMRAM, which
loads GEM into RAM, and the program Shell Buffer (SHBUFxxx.PRG), which
lets you configure the allowed size of the INF file.
<br>
</p>
<p>Both solutions should work great on any Atari, and both have their
advantages and disadvantages. Give them both a try and see which works
best for you.
<br>
</p>
<p>Something else to keep in mind when editing your INF file is that
TOS expects to find certain formats at certain locations in the file.
Line #d, for instance, has to have a certain number of spaces in it
since TOS looks roughly 124 bytes into the INF file for the next line
(#Z if you have TOS &gt;=1.04 and a program set to auto boot, or #K
for the menu key equivalents). That number for the bytes, incidently,
also includes carriage returns (EOL characters). Before changing your
desktop file, be sure you know *exactly* how many spaces belong in
line #d; the wrong number can produce unpredictable results and fatal
errors. To find out, of course, just load the file into a text editor
that doesn't strip trailing spaces (Word Writer, Alice, Everest, and
tons more) and start counting!
<br>
</p>
<p>Most other lines (but not all of them) in the INF file require a
trailing space, so if you edit your file be sure to know which ones
need a space and which ones don't.
<br>
</p>
<p>What this all means, of course, is that if you edit your
DESKTOP.INF or NEWDESK.INF file make sure you're using an editor that
doesn't strip trailing spaces, and which saves files as ASCII text.
And, as always, KEEP A BACKUP OF YOUR ORIGINAL INF FILE!
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> THE KEYBOARD AND INSTALLING APPS </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>With the newer TOS versions, you can open a drive into a window by
pressing &lt;Alt&gt; and the drive letter. If you want to open a drive
into the current top window, you don't have to close the window and
then open the drive; just hold down &lt;Cntrl&gt; and press the drive
letter! The window will automatically be changed to the root directory
of whatever drive you selected.
<br>
</p>
<p>With TOS versions 2.0x and up, Atari has made it possible to
assign a keyboard equivalent to any of the desktop menu items. That
way you can select a file and hit &quot;I&quot; to get info on it.
Unfortunately, the mneumonics can get pretty complicated, since there
are also items that could use &quot;I&quot; like &quot;Show as
Icons&quot; and &quot;Install Icon.&quot; &quot;D&quot; could be used
for &quot;Sort by Date,&quot; &quot;Delete,&quot; and &quot;Install
Devices.&quot; The desktop appears to only allow normal characters
(capital A through Z) for these assignments, which gets pretty
limiting. Luckly, you can also use control-key combinations! When
changing the menu assignments in the Desktop Configuration menu, just
hold down the &lt;control&gt; key while pressing your key. Now,
instead of accidently deleting a file by pressing &quot;D,&quot; you
can assign &lt;cntrl&gt;&lt;delete&gt; (or &lt;cntrl&gt;&lt;D&gt;, if
yo prefer) to &quot;Delete,&quot; and never have to worry about
accidentally deleting a file!
<br>
</p>
<p>Take note! If you use a control-key combo for a particular menu
item, that combo will no longer be available for normal desktop usage.
For instance, if you assign &lt;cntrl&gt;&lt;D&gt; to &quot;Show by
Date,&quot; &lt;cntrl&gt;&lt;D&gt; will no longer be used to open
drive D into the currently active window, instead it will be used to
delete selected files.
<br>Remember:
<br>
</p>
<p>Alternate + (A-P) = Open the drive's directory into a window
<br>Control + (A-P) = Open the drive's directory in the active window
You can get all of the normal Desktop key commands by pressing
&lt;help&gt; while at the Desktop.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Not only can you assign a key combo to &quot;Delete,&quot; you can
also remove the trash icon completely, and free up space for more
important icons! Just select the Trash icon and then the menu item
&quot;Remove Icon.&quot; In fact, since TOS versions 2.0x and up allow
you to open drives by pressing &lt;alternate&gt; and the drive letter,
you can remove all the drive icons, too, and replace them with
programs, folders, and files! If you need to actually see what's on
drive D, just press &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;D&gt;.
<br>
</p>
<p>Something users of *any* TOS version can do is install more than
one document type for an application! To do this, first install the
application for one of the filetypes you want. Then load the
DESKTOP/NEWDESK.INF file into an ASCII editor. Make a copy of the
installed application line, making sure to keep all the copies
together with the original in the .INF file. It will look something
<br>like:
<br>
</p>
<p>#Y FF 04 000 C:\path\GEMVIEW.GTP@ *.PI3@ @
<br>
<br>Then rename the installed file type (&quot;*.PI3&quot;) to
whatever other file type you want. Make sure to keep all of these
lines together. After doing this a few times, you might have the
following lines in your .INF file:
<br>
</p>
<p>#Y FF 04 000 C:\path\GEMVIEW.GTP@ *.PI?@ @
<br>#Y FF 04 000 C:\path\GEMVIEW.GTP@ *.PC?@ @
<br>#Y FF 04 000 C:\path\GEMVIEW.GTP@ *.GIF@ @
<br>
<br>Editing your INF file manually like this is the only way to
install one application for more than one file type, since using
&quot;Install Application&quot; from the desktop will just overwrite
any previous assignment, rather than adding to it.
<br>
</p>
<p>Of course, instead of installing an application for a particular
extender, you might try editing the lines for a particular *prefix*!
You could do something like:
<br>
<br>#G 03 04 000 C:\UTILS\FILE_VIE.WER\AV380.PRG@ READ*.*@ @
<br>
<br>So that whenever you double clicked on a file like
&quot;READ.ME&quot;, ASCII View 3.80 would be run and the file loaded
into it for viewing!
<br>
</p>
<p>In fact, you can replace the Desktop's boring old [ SHOW | PRINT |
CANCEL] by installing an application for all file types. Be careful;
since this works as a catch-all, you have to make sure that such an
installation is the *last* line TOS checks when you double click. That
means it has to be the first application line in the .INF file
(remember, TOS uses the DESKTOP/NEWDESK.INF file as a sort of filter,
working from the end of the .INF to the beginning. Basically, the
place to install an app like this is the line just before the *.APP,
*.PRG, *.TOS, etc. is defined. See the annotated INF file below for an
example.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> NEAT HACKS </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>In any version of TOS you can, of course, change the name of any
desktop icon to anything you want. This is true of the Trash can,
which can be renamed HAZARD or whatever you want. It's also true of
any programs or folders you put on the desktop (in TOS &gt;= 2.0x);
Just look at the line of the INF file where that file/folder appears.
It will look something like:
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>The name seen on the desktop will be &quot;VIEWER.PRG.&quot; You
can change this to &quot;SEE IT!&quot; just by changing the line to
something like:
<br>
<br>Of course, as I said above, you don't really need the trash or
drive icons on TOS &gt;= 2.0x, so why not just get rid of them? You
can free up tons of space on the desktop for commonly used programs,
files, and folders. It also has the nice side-affect of freeing up
space in your INF file, allowing you to have a few more lines of icon
or application assignments. This is a great tip for people who use
Desk Switch or Load Inf; you can replace the drive icons with INF file
icons, allowing you easy access not to your drives but to the work you
need to do.
<br>
</p>
<p>One feature that deserves to be recognized, though it isn't a
hack, is the drag and drop feature of TOS &gt;= 2.0x. With this
feature, you can put your commonly used programs on the desktops and
then just drag the file you want to work on over the app (until the
app is highlighted), then &quot;drop&quot; the file. This has the
advantage of requiring fewer steps to get working, as well as not
requiring you to install the application in the INF file, thereby
saving a few bytes of space.
<br>
</p>
<p>Create INF files specific to programs, put them all in a common
folder, and use Desk Switch or Load Inf to switch between them. You
can have a DTP.INF, WORDPROC.INF, GEMDRAW.INF, DEGAS.INF, TELECOM.INF,
UNARC.INF, etc. This frees up a lot of space in any particular INF
file. And with each INF, each type of file used with that task can
have its own unique icon, so it's easy to distinguish file types, and
you can also have all the installed application info you want! Using
just one INF file really limits you in what you can do, so make more!
<br>
</p>
<p>Reset your keyboard-equivalents for the desktop menus so they make
sense! Use normal keys for one menu, and &lt;cntrl&gt;-key combos for
the other. You can even try &lt;shft&gt;&lt;cntrl&gt;-key combos.
Require two keys to be pressed when deleting or formating.
<br>
</p>
<p>Get a resource editor (like MKRSC; this works with TOS 4.0x icons)
and build your own icons, then assign them by hex number to files in
your INF file.
<br>
</p>
<p>Put a folder on the the desktop and save the INF file. Then edit
the INF file so that the line containing that folder begins with #X
instead of #V. Now when you double click on the folder, the default
document displayer is run, and the contents of the folder are loaded
in a batch mode. This is an excellent way of viewing new pictures or
text files! You can even use masks to control what sort of files load
in. Of course, your viewer has to be capable of processing batch jobs.
<br>
</p>
<p>Make yourself a blank icon (no mask, nothin'). You can now assign
short notes to the name of the icon, such as Fkey assignments, short
reminders, and whatnot. If you have TOS &gt;= 2.0x, you can put these
&quot;sticky notes&quot; on the desktop, too. They are easily editable
from the desktop.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b>INF FILE COMPOSITION </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Below is a (fairly) complete explanation of the lines in the
DESKTOP.INF or NEWDESK.INF files. Some parameters only apply to
specific versions of TOS. Compare what's below to what is already in
your .INF file, and if it's not already there, DON'T ADD IT! TOS
expects certain lines to have a particular format, and adding to these
lines can confuse TOS and give you headaches. On the other hand,
deleting things can have the same effect, so don't do that either.
<br>
<br>Where a description is given by &quot;bits,&quot; the following
procedure will produce the needed hexidecimal number:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>start with the high bit (e.g. bit &quot;7&quot;), and begin
writing down the desired configuration as a binary number (1's and
0's) from left to right. Unlisted bits should not be changed. When the
number is complete, convert it to hex. Any decent calculator will do
this without a fuss. For example: For the &quot;Other configuration
parameters&quot; (see below), I want bit 4 set to &quot;filname,&quot;
so I write a 0; bit 3 I want set to &quot;top window&quot;, so to the
right of the zero I write another 0; then bit 2 I set &quot;size to
fit&quot; on, so I write a 1 to the right of bit 3; bit 1 is not
listed so I write a 1 (since that's what it was originally); finally
bit 0 I want set to &quot;sort on,&quot; so I write a 0. The resulting
number is &quot;00110.&quot; I set my calculator to &quot;bin&quot;
and plug this number in, then convert it to hex (by changing the
calculator mode to &quot;hex&quot;). The resulting number, which goes
in the fourth column of line #E is 06.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with doing this, I suggest you try it out a
couple times and compare it with what's already in your desktop file.
Don't try changing anything until you are confident you can get it
right! Wrong values can do unpredictable things to your system,
including causing it to crash!
<br>
</p>
<p>I have been unable to determine the usage of some bits. In these
cases, I list the bit with a question mark and give the current value
in my NEWDESK.INF file. Yours may be different, so check it and use
whatever your INF file uses. To check it, convert the current hex
value to binary: the rightmost number is bit 0, the digit to the left
of that is bit 1, and so on. Converting hex 06 to bin is 110: bit 0 =
0; bit 1 = 1, bit 2 = 1, bit 3 = 0 (not shown), and bit 4 = 0 (also
not shown).
<br>
</p>
<p>And remember, if you find you've made a mistake, just delete the
broken .INF file and re-load the old version that you backed up.
<br>
<br>All &quot;@&quot; symbols must be followed by a space.

Installed Applications have the following info

   #n 04 04 000 C:\path\progname@ *.*@ @

Where #n is any of the following:
     #G  for GEM prg
     #Y  for GTP prg
     #P  for TTP prg
     #F  for TOS prg

The first 04 is the prg icon.  Changing this has no effect
The second 04 is the document icon.  Changing this has no effect.
Both of these should be set to the same value.

  000  contains the following information :

       First Digit  -   Number           Meaning
                          0      Default Directory = Top Window
                                 Parameter = Filename Only
                          1      Default Directory = Application
                                 Parameter = Filename Only
                          2      Default Directory = Top Window
                                 Parameter = Full Path
                          3      Default Directory = Application
                                 Parameter = Full Path

       Second and Third Digit  =  Function key assignment F1 to
       shiftF10:
                  00 = no assignment      01 = F1
                  0A = F10                0F = F15
                  10 = F16                14 = F20

Following this is the full path and file name, followed immediately by
an &quot;@&quot; symbol.  After the &quot;@&quot; is a space followed by the installed
document type (if any), followed by a second &quot;@&quot;.  Next comes another
space followed by any parameters that are to be passed to the program
(for GTP or TTP programs).  Finally comes another &quot;@&quot; and a space.

For example,

  #P FF 04 009 C:\PATH\VIEWER.TTP@ *.*@ @

would install the program VIEWER.TTP as the default document displayer
(this then supercedes the desktop [ SHOW | PRINT | CANCEL ]).  This
line also sets VIEWER.TTP to run when F9 is pressed.  There are no
parameters passed to this program.

===================================================

Default window icons-

 Example: #G 03 03 000 @ *.PRG@ @

First column = type
    #I = specific file or file type *
    #N = non-specific file *
    #D = folder
    #G = Gem app
    #Y = GTP app
    #P = TTP app
    #F = Tos app

second column = default icon # for #G, #F, #Y, #P
    New default icon can be installed for app type by changing this #

third column = default icon # for #N, #D
    New icon can be installed for non-prg files by changing this #

Both the second and third column should contain the same hexidecimal
number.

fourth column - function key assignment.  Leave at 000 (no assingment)

fifth column - @ filename.ext@ @  wildcard

* #I assigns an icon to the specified file or file type.  It does not
  assign an action.
  #N assigns an icon to the specified file or file type and specifies
  it as a non-executable file.  If the line
      #N 0B 0B 000 @ *.*@ @
  appears below the default lines for APP, PRG, etc. (i.e.
      #G 03 FF 000 *.APP@ @ @
      #G 03 FF 000 *.PRG@ @ @ etc.),
  programs will not execute when double-clicked on.

=====================================================================

Desktop Icons-

 Example: #X 08 02 18 FF   C:\UTILS\VIEWER\VIEWER.PRG@ SEE IT!@

first column = type
    #M = Storage Device
    #T = Trash
    #O = Printer
    #X = Application
    #V = Directory

second column = horizontal position in icon widths

third column = vertical position in icon widths

fourth column = Hex value of Icon number in DESKTOP.RSC

fifth column = FF (function unknown)

sixth column = Device ID (A-P) or space

Finally: full path and filename@ icon label@  (for a file or folder)
         Device name@ @                       (for a device)

#P 03 04 000 C:\UTILS\FILE_VIE.WER\GUCK18\GUCK.TTP@ *.*@ @
This line installs Guck as the default file viewer.  When the file is
double clicked on, TOS checks all the #G, #P, #Y, and #F assignments
below, and if the file doesn't match any of those, Guck is run and the
file is loaded in.  Notice that it is the first assignment in the INF
file, and hence the last assigment TOS checks.  If you moved this one
down a few lines (say, underneath #F 03 04 000 *.TOS@ @ @ ), you'd
never get any programs to run; everything (except the .INFs and
archives) would be loaded directly into Guck!

#G 03 FF 000 *.ACC@ @ @

Executable programs and programs to run when files with the
appropriate mask are opened.  The second two digits of the third
column of numbers (&quot;00&quot; of the &quot;200&quot;) is the hex number of the

File icons and function key assignments.  Notice these act as filters
also, and hence files are applied from the bottom up.  For example,
SQUISHII.APP is assigned icon 3D, but a file called SQUID.GHU doesn't
match any filter, it would be assigned the default icon 0B.

<p><b> COMMENTS </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Notice if a file is clicked on and is not a *.INF or one of the
listed archival types, TOS then checks to see if it is either TOS,
TTP, GTP, PRG, or APP (in that order), and if so executes it. If it is
not one of these, the remaining installation for types *.*
&quot;catches&quot; it, so GUCK will be run and the file will be
loaded in. This then replaces the desktop [ SHOW | PRINT |CANCEL].
Remember that each of these acts as a filter and that TOS applies them
from *bottom* to top; so when you double-click on a file, TOS first
checks to see if it is *.INF, and if so runs LOADINF.PRG, then it
checks for type *.ARJ, then... through the executables (TOS, TTP, GTP,
PRG, APP in that order), and finally if the file wasn't one of those,
TOS type *.* (that's everything left) is loaded into GUCK.

     Das Byte mit der Nummer $30 ist f&uuml;r die Geschwindigkeit des
     Mausklicks zust&auml;ndig. (Das 49te Zeichen in der Kette)
     Die Werte hierf&uuml;r bewegen sich zwischen 0-4
     Das Byte $31 verursacht den Keyklick ..... (0 oder 1)
     Byte $32 schaltet die Software Glocke an oder aus...
     Die Bytes $33 und $34 (52+53 Stelle) beinhalten die Zeit der Tasten-
     wiederholung. (Werte zwischen 1 - 46 sind zugelassen)
     Und die letzten beiden Zahlen geben an, wie schnell die Taste wieder
     auf dem Bildschirm dargestellt wird.
 ..........................................................................
 #d
     Ist relativ unbekannt, kommt aber immer vor !
 ..........................................................................

 #D
     Mit dem gro&szlig;en &quot; D &quot; wird das Aussehen der Icons festgelegt.
     Der erste Wert ist immer $FF...
     00 = Diskstation
     01 = Ordner Icon
     02 = das ist der M&uuml;lleimer
     03 = Programm Icon
     04 = Datei Icon
     Danach folgt meist eine Maske der Dateien, die vom TOS dargestellt
     werden sollen.

     Muster der Zeile :   #D FF 01   @  *.*@
 ..........................................................................
 #E
     Hier wird festgehalten, wie das Betriebsystem Kopiervorg&auml;nge behandelt.
     Untenstehende Tabelle gibt Auskunft &uuml;ber die einzelnen Bits der ersten
     Zahl. Die zweite Zahl, das erste Zeichen (0 oder 1) sagt aus, ob der
     Blitter Chip ein oder ausgeschaltet ist.
     Das zweite Zeichen gibt die momentane Aufl&ouml;sung an 3= High
                                                        2= Mid
                                                        1= Low
     Beispiel:   #E 18 13
     Diese Zeile sagt aus, da&szlig; TOS l&ouml;scht, kopiert und bei der Verwendung von
     TOS 1.4 &Uuml;berschreibwarnmeldungen ausgibt. Die Dateien sind alphabetisch
     sortiert und das Directory wird mit GEM-Icons dargestellt.
     Weitere Einstellungen kann man aus der Tabelle entnehmen.

 #F
     #F 03 04   @ *.TOS@
     Hier meldet die Desktop <a href="0205.htm" target="UDOcon">Information</a> dem GEM, welche Dateien als TOS-
     Programm gestartet werden soll.
     Die Zeile wird bei Verwendung der Funktion &quot;Anwendung anmelden&quot;
     folgenderma&szlig;en aussehen...
     #F 03 04   TEST.TOS@  *.DOC@
     Es w&uuml;rde bedeuten, da&szlig; wenn man im Desktop eine Datei mit dem
     Extender .DOC anklickt sofort das Programm TEST.TOS gestartet wird.
     Diese Zeile sieht bei TOS 1.4 etwas anders aus, die Funktion ist die
     gleiche.
     Die Pfadnahmen d&uuml;rfen nat&uuml;rlich auch wesentlich l&auml;nger sein.

 ..........................................................................
 #G
     Hier wird festgelegt, welche Programme unter GEM gestartet werden.
     Die Grundeinstellung ist ungef&auml;hr so:
     #G 03 FF *.PRG@ @
     Wie bei &quot;F&quot; Zeilen k&ouml;nnen Voreinstellungen f&uuml;r Autostarts gemacht
     werden. (Anwendung anmelden)
 ..........................................................................
 #M
     Ist f&uuml;r die Laufwerkskennzeichnung zust&auml;ndig. Die ersten beiden Ziffern
     geben die Position des Icons an.
     Die dritte Ziffer beschreibt den Icon-Typ (schon mal einen M&uuml;lleimer
     als Laufwerk gehabt ?)
     Der Buchstabe vor der Bezeichnung gibt das aktuelle Laufwerk an.
     #M 00 00 00 FF A Floppy 1 @ @
 ...........................................................................
 #P
     Hier wird bestimmt, wie die .TTP Anwendungen aussehen....
     Es gilt im allgemeinen dasselbe wie bei &quot;D&quot;
     #P 03 FF   *.TTP@ @
 ...........................................................................
 #T
    Jetzt kommt es...
    Das ist der Buchstabe f&uuml;r unseren geliebten M&uuml;lleimer !!
    Die Position und der Aufbau ist gleich einer &quot;M&quot; Zeile...
 ...........................................................................
 #W
    Gibt das Aussehen der Fenster, den Zustand
    sowie die Position der Rollbalken an.
    Die Zeile besteht aus 7 Hex Ziffern (wie die anderen auch)
    $0: Position des waagerechten Scrollbalkens
    $1: Position der vertikalen Scrollbalken
    $2: Obere linke Ecke des aktuellen Fensters (waagerechte Position)
    $3: Obere linke Ecke des aktuellen Fensters (vertikale Position)
    $4: Breite des Fensters
    $5: H&ouml;he des Fensters
    $6: wahrscheinlich Laufwerkskennung
    Bei ge&ouml;ffnetem Fenster erfolgt die Angabe des Pfades, die Zeile wird
    &uuml;blicherweise mit dem Klammeraffen beendet.
    #W 00 00 20 01 1F 08 0A D:\*.*@
 ..........................................................................
 #Z
    Diese Zeile taucht nur beim TOS 1.4 auf ....
    Man k&ouml;nnte mit der Zeile einen Autostart erzeugen, ohne da&szlig; man einen
    Autoordner benutzt.
    Nat&uuml;rlich funktioniert das auch mit GEM-Programmen, die ja bekannterweise
    nicht aus einem Autoordner gestartet werden.
    Die erste Ziffer sagt: 00 = GEM AUS \ 01 = GEM AN
    Danach kommt die Pfadbeschreibung, um die gew&uuml;nschte Datei auch zu finden.
    #Z 01 A:\TEST.PRG@
    Das w&uuml;rde bedeuten, da&szlig; &quot;TEST.PRG&quot; nach dem Booten automatisch gestartet wird !
