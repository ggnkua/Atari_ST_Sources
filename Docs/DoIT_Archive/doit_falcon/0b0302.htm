</p>
<p>Important note for the users of BlowUP030 or other screen
enhancement software together with FX:
</p>
<p>When the Falcons own 32MHz Pixelclock is used, this only works
correct, if no acceleration is activated. When the Falcon is switched
to 36MHz (via the FX-CPX) this clock is also used for display output.
This means that the values, BlowUP gives you for the horizontal and
vertical frequencies are wrong. To calculate the correct numbers you
have to multiply BlowUPs values by 1.125 (i.e. 36/32). At 40MHz you
have to multiply by 1.25 (40/32).
</p>
<p>Example: You have the Falcon set to 40MHz system clock and you are
using the internal pixel clock of originally 32MHz. BlowUP tells you
that you have 40kHz (vert) and 76Hz (hor). In reality you have 50kHz
and 96Hz. If you have a fixed frequency monitor or an older multiscan
monitor you have to pay attention to this!

<br>
</div>
<p>Positive side-effect: In 256 and 65536 colors you can achieve
higher refreshrates through the faster system clock!
</p>
<p>The large number of different clock patches that can be found in
the falcon, often causes uncertainties when installing the FX
accelerator. For better understanding this is a rough plan of the
interestingarea:
</p>
<pre>
                  | = central source of 16MHz-CPU-clockt
                  R                      from COMBEL U56
    (1)    (2)    R = R217
     |      |     |
   R216    R221   :
     |      |     :
     :......:.....:
                 :
                 |
               R222
                 |
                (3)



              .:. means: invisible conducting connection
              (1) leads to expansion slot
              (2) leads to DMA-chip and to the FPU
              (3) leads to the CPU
</pre>
<p>In all clock patch variations at least the resistors R216/R221 are
removed and an 74F04 or 74F08 is installed instead. For that on/two
wire(s) lead from R217 or the lower connections of R216/R221 to the
clockpatch.
</p>
<dl>
Version 1: One wire from 74F04/08 connects the twoupper connections
(1) and (2) of R216/R221.Version 2: Two wires separately lead from the
4F04/08 to the upper pads of R216 (1) / R221 (2). Additionaly there
can be: Version A: R222 is removed and a wire leads from the 74F04/08
to (3). Then this wire has to be removed and the enclosed 33-Ohm
resistor has to be soldered at R222. If there is already a clockpatch
installed it should be generally left installed, but perhaps has to be
modified:
<br>&nbsp;
</dl>
<p>With Version 1 AND FPU installed:
<br>Re-solder the wire, so that it only contacts (1). At this
connection also the wire to the DMA chip should be soldered. Besides
from this the clockpatch can be left untouched. Only if
problems/unstabilities occur in accelerated condition, which cannot be
resolved as described in the file DMA_PROB.GB, installation of our
version of the clockpatch, described in the manual should be
considered.

</div>
<p>Annotations to using Cubase <a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a>.
</p>
<p>* CAF seems to be using only ST-RAM as sample memory, no matter
how the program flags are set. Steinberg told us that these bahaviour,
which had once a good reason, but which is forgotten meanwhile (see
Douglas Adams), will be removed in the next update of Cubase <a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a>.
</p>
<p>If you set CAFs program flags to TT-Run and TT-Malloc, at least
the program itself is being load into FX-RAM. If you move all the
AUTO-folder programs and accessories into FX-RAM this will give you
about 3.5MB of free ST RAM, which should be sufficient in most cases.
</p>
<p>* In very rare cases (we haven't been able to see any particular
reason, and it hasen't happened lately anyway) it is possible that
Cubases loses its left audio channel when operating with 50MHz DSP
clock or that strange audio-problems or even crashes occur.
</p>
<p>If this happens to you, maybe you should solder the DSP clock wire
to the cut end of L102:
</p>
<pre>                +----------------&gt; DSP
                |
  O-----HHHHHH--+-   --O
         L102



</pre>
<p align=center><img src="image/dsp1.gif" border=0 width="255" height="132"></p><br>
<div align=center><tt>Picture 3 - DSP with Clock from FX-Board</tt>
</div>
<p>With that modification the DSP will always run with the system
clock, i.e. 32, 36 or 40MHz. That way the DSP remains faster than the
CPU (which is the main reason for DSP acceleration) but no channels
are lost any more.
</p>
<p>* On our test-falcon Cubase works fine with all CPU clock settings
(i.e. also with 40MHz CPU).
</p>
<p>Georg Acher/BlowUP 03.07.95/11.11.95
<br>
</p>
<p>With some Falcons (mostly main board revision C/D) problems with
the DMA system can (not necessarily) arise. This can be noticed as
SCSI and sound problems.
</p>
<p>The following solution for the problem should work:
</p>
<p>- Without FPU: There is a wire from the upper connection of R221
to the clockpatch-IC 74F04 or 74F08. Remove this wire from the IC and
solder it to the upper connection of R217 (same point where the yellow
wire of FX is connected!) Result should be a connection between
R221/upper pad to R217/lower pad.
</p>
<p>- With FPU: Here a wire leads from 74F04/74F08 directly to the DMA
chip. Remove this from the 74F04/08 and connect it to the upper pad of
R217 (where also the yellow wire is connected). Result should be a
connection between R217/upper pad and DMA chip.
</p>
<p>Should the problems remain (especially with 40MHz CPU clock) the
following change could help: - Re-establish the connection R221/upper
to 74F04/08 or DMA-chip to 74F04/08. (i.e. remove the patch we just
recommended :-) )
</p>
<p>- With/without FPU: There is a wire from the LOWER connection of
R221 to 74F04/08. Remove this wire from R221 and solder it to the
upper connection of R217. (yellow wire)
</p>
<p>For the interested: All these modifications are changing the
timing of the DMA chip's clock. This is the most crucial part of the
Falcon design, so changing the Falcons timing (as accelerators do)
creates problems mostly at this part...
</p>
<p>Georg Acher / BlowUP 11.08.95
<br>
</p>
<p>Annotations to Falcon Speed:
<br>
</p>
<p>The starting program doesn't recognize the additionally available
memory. So despite of 8MB FX-RAM only 2.4MB are useable.
<br>
</p>
<p>Should anybody out there have the source-code of the driver ( ;-)
) itshouldn't be too difficult to change the fixed screen memory from
ramtop to ST-RAM...
</p>
<p>Annotation to Linux:
<br>
</p>
<p>Thanks to Michael Harwerth (Michael_Harwerth@hg.maus.de) there is
a patch for the boot loader, so that Linux recognizes the FX RAM.

<p><a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a> and the FX-RAM...
<br>
</p>
<p>For unknown reasons <a href="1307.htm" target="UDOcon">MiNT</a> only works together with FX-RAM when
memory protection (MINTNP.PRG) is OFF
<br>. With memory protection it either is not accepted or results into

<p>Georg Acher/BlowUP 29.06.95
<br>
</p>
<p>Hint to use the NOVA graphics card with FX:
<br>
</p>
<p>Because of a minor design flaw (no open collector exit of the
expand signal) of the NOVA-adaptercard, the NOVA won't work together
with FX under certain circumstances (e.g. higher temperatures):
<br>
</p>
<p>After launch of FXDRIVE.PRG the machine crashes and you can see
random pixels on the screen. We strongly recommend not to work so, as
even with seemingly undisturbed operation, most heavy errors and data
losses are likely to happen.
<br>
</p>
<p>To remove this problem the following patch of the NOVA adapter is
necessary:
<br>
</p>
<p>A Schottky-Diode BAT41 (or similar) has to be inserted into the
expand signal, which is marked in the following sketch:

Separate the connection on the lower side (U) at the position X.

Then solder the diode BAT41 with the anode at pin 49 and the

<p>Here the description and solution of some problems that can (but
not must) occur with FX.
<br>
</p>
<p>Because this is a lot of text, it could be wise to print it out.
<br>
</p>
<p>- General instability also at 16MHz
<br>- General instability at 32/36/40MHz CPU clock.
<br>- FPU problems
<br>- IDE problems
<br>- RAM/SIMM problems
<br>- SCSI/DMA problems
<br>- Heat problems and resulting instability.
<br>
</p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>- General instability also at 16MHz
<br>
</p>
<p>- Maybe the DSP doesn't like the 50MHz clock.
<br>
</p>
<p>Solution: The clock wire that leads to the DSP has to be connected
at the right (hanging in the air) side of L102. Then the DSP gets the
system clock (32/36/40MHz).
<br>
</p>
<p>- Maybe the main clock of 32MHz (taken out of the falcon) is a bit
<br>weak, so that it is disturbed by the FX.
<br>
</p>
<p>Solution: Dissolder the red wire at the right pin of L102 and
connect it (with a longer wire) with the right lower connection of the
32MHz oscillator near the DSP. This is the source of the connection
which has to be separated for the DSP accelerator.
<br>
</p>
<p>- Shorten all wires as far as possible.
<br>
</p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>- General instability at 32/36/40 MHz CPU clock
<br>
</p>
<p>- Different setting of the 123I-buttons in the CPX.
<br>In order to work properly at doubled CPU clock (32/36/40MHz) the
Falcon needs to have a certain phase relation between system clock and
CPU clock. The functioning gap is so narrow that a difference of 8
nano seconds can lead to immediate crash.
<br>This correct phase relation is not the same in each Falcon.
<br>To make acceleration possible, there are different delays can be
activated in FX to shift CPU clock from system clock.
<br>Button 1 delays approx. 9ns
<br>Button 2 delays approx. 4ns
<br>Button 3 delays approx. 2ns
<br>Button I inverts the clock (i.e. 12.5ns at 40MHz)
<br>With that the phase relation can be adjusted very fine. If the
machine for example crashes with the default '123I' adjustment, you
may play around with that setting. ` (no button activated) may be
worth a try.
<br>
</p>
<p>- Since V1.1: Setting DM2 in the CPX.
<br>Through tolerances it is possible that switching the clock does
not work cleanly and clock jitter can happen. This can lead to
instabilities or to 'flashes' on the screen.
<br>Since V1.1 it is possible to activate a different mode of clock
switching with the DM2 button. This leads to a performance loss of
approx. 1-2%.
<br>
</p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>
</p>
<p>- FPU-problems:
<br>Should the FPU work not at all or unreliably (check this with
<br>appropriate software) there are 2 possibilities:
<br>
</p>
<p>- FPU fails already at 32/36 MHz:
<br>16MHz-FPUs should not be clocked higher than 25MHz.
<br>If you use such a FPU you should get the clock not from L102 but
from the upper connection of R217. Then the FPU always gets half the
system clock (i.e. 16/18/20MHz). Alternatively the wire can also be
soldered to the free upper right connection of the 25MHz oscillator
(U41) unter the IDE hard disk.
<br>
</p>
<p>- FPU fails at 40MHz system clock:
<br>Probably the clock amplitude is to small.
<br>Solution:
<br>- Shorter wire from 68-Ohm resistor to R221
<br>- Use a smaller resistor to the FPU instead of 68 Ohm. (57, 47 or
39 Ohm). For unknown reasons (ATARI...) it can then be that the screen
may be disturbed by some flashes, when pixelclock=system clock.
<br>
</p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>
</p>
<p>- IDE-Problems:
<br>For the IDE-drive in the Falcon being controlled by a quite
strange circuit it is possible that, under certain circumstances
(mostly older Seagate drives with 40-65MB), these drive will not
deliver proper data.
<br>This may be tested by pressing the Escape key on desktop while a
window from the questioned drive os opened. Watch the total number of
bytes displayed in the windows info-line. When this number changes
sometimes, don't trust the drive and don't start programs from it. A
better test is the program MEMTEST.TTP enclosed with Kobold, the fast
file copier.
<br>
</p>
<p>Solution (in V1.01):
<br>By activating DM1 in the CPX a clock reducement for IDE accesses
can be activated. This is a rather brutal method which could also lead
to crashes...
<br>In case that should work, test your drive carefully again.
<br>
</p>
<p>Other solution:
<br>Install the miniprogram IDEAL.PRG in the AUTO-folder behind
FXDRIVE.PRG.
<br>
</p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>
</p>
<p>- RAM/SIMM problems:
<br>
</p>
<p>- If FXDRIVE announces no or too few memory at boot time, check
the
<br>configuration in FXCONF. Remember to SWITCH OFF the Falcon after
changing the configuration!!
<br>
</p>
<p>- If FXDRIVE announces defective SIMMs, the error message gives a
hint
<br>on the defective memory bank and the bit error mask.
<br>If only one or two bits are set in the mask it is probably a
contact problem of the SIMM sockets. Gentle(!) bending down and
cleaning the# contacts should help. Are even 8bits at once '1', the
SIMM itself is not working properly.
<br>
</p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>
</p>
<p>- SCSI/DMA/Sound problems:
<br>Occur mostly at 40MHz system clock and can be checked via MEMTEST
and
<br>appropriate SCSI drive. If the clockpatch using the 74F04 is not
installed this should be done first!
<br>
</p>
<p>Solution:
<br>As described in DMA_PROB.GB
<br>
</p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br>
</p>
<p>- Heat problems and resulting instability
<br>
</p>
<p>By a too strong rise of CPU temperature the critical phase
relation
<br>is changed, which can lead to increasing instability. This has got
nothing to to with 'overheating' the CPU. In a properly designed 68030
system that would do nothing...
<br>
</p>
<p>Possible solution:
<br>1) remove and let away the upper shielding iron.
<br>2) remove the Falcons fan from the original position (which is
quite a
<br>useless one) and move it between ROM-port and STE-joystickports,
so that
<br>it can blow below the FX thereby optimally cooling the CPU. The
necessary
<br>+12V can be found at the right connection of C110 above the right
foot
<br>of the power supply. There you can solder the red wire of the fan.
<br>The black wire can be soldered to the border of the mainboard.

<p>The following features are not yet implemented in the current
version of FX:
<br>
</p>
<p>- Pagemode
<br>We decided to make the accelerator first stable then faster. But
the pagemode will certainly come and can be installed through simple
software update.
<br>
</p>
<p>- Switching the DSP-accelerator from 32 to 50 MHz
<br>For technical reasons the planned changable DSP clock has been
cancelled: The Falcon reacts surprisingly instable to that. Now the
DSP always is clocked with 50MHz. For programs that don't work with
that (probably Cubase <a href="0907.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a>) there is another possibility (see
CUBASE.txt).
<br>
</p>
<p>- EMS (more than 10MB FX-RAM)
<br>
</p>
<p>* Important:
<br>If you get a software update or change something in FXCONF you
have to SWITCH OFF the Falcon to make the change happen. A Reset won't
be enough!
<br>
</p>
<p>* Should you have problems with your IDE hard disk at 36/40MHz CPU
<br>clock (especially with the 65MB Seagate drive), please tell us.
There is special correction circuitry for this strange behaviour of
the Falcon-IDE-access in the FX, but there may be some drives that
need further correction.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Such an accelerator is a quite critical thing, even more so if
it is
<br>to work in the Falcon. For that reason it is possible that the
accelerator won't work with 36/40MHz in your Falcon. With the fine
adjustment in FX-CPX (Buttons 1/2/3/I) some tolerances can be
levelled, but not all.
<br>
</p>
<p>Should you have such a Falcon tell us the board revision and
serial number
<br>of your Falcon (but only after trying 1/2/3/I combinations).
Perhaps we can fix the problem.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Although the FX-RAM is installed as 'Alternate-RAM' into TOS,
there is
<br>no real difference to normal Falcon RAM except from missing video
access. That means: SCSI and Sound-DMA are working fine in FX-RAM.
That means, all programs using RAM as sound memory, can use FX-RAM, as
long as the adress space stays under 16MB.
<br>
</p>
<p>* The whole FX-hardware is being defined through the contents of
<br>FXSETS.FXB. Without this file nothing will work! This file is
protected against damage through checksums. For future updates (most
probably) only this file has to be replaced. In this file nearly the
whole development work for FX is concentrated. As the very core part
of FX it is copyrighted and must not be copied and/or given to third
persons. Also any modifications and not intented use of this file (for
whatever reason) is not allowed.

</p>
<p>Optional hardware change to increase CPU write access speed:
<br>
</p>
<p>This change was invented in the last minute, therefore is not
included
<br>on the FX card itself... but the speed increase is worth it, so
here is what to do:
<br>
</p>
<p>A 15cm wire has to be soldered from a pin of the FX controller
chip to a pin of U63.
<br>
</p>
<p>To find the soldering spot on the FX card, here a small drawing.
The right pin is marked with a 'o' and a '^' below.

<p>Short explanation:
<br>
</p>
<p>The Falcon logic in U63/U68 speeds down the 68030-accesses to
68000 speed, i.e. one bus cycle always lasts four clock cycles.
Through our wire this logic is circumvented and the 68030 being told,
that it can end the bus cycle. That way an FX access can last only 3
clock cycles. That (at the moment) only happens at write accesses,
because (depending on RAM type) during read accesses correct data
could not be present at the data bus and the 68030 gets invalid data.
<br>
</p>
<p>Attention:
<br>Gembench's RAM-ACCESS only times read accesses! thereby
<br>not noticing this accelleration. MEMSPEED.TOS is more suitable for
that...

<p>Description of the enclosed utilities (if not already in the
manual)
<br>
</p>
<p>SETSPEED.TTP
<br>
</p>
<p>TOS program for shells, as FXCPX, only commandline orientated.
<br>
</p>
<p>Sets the acellerator:
<br>
</p>
<pre>
Call:
        setspeed [-h] [-CPUSPEED] [-t] [-FLAGS] [-DFLAGS]

no arguments: ouput the CPU-Speed

CPUSPEED: 16, 18, 20, 32, 36, 40

-t: Takes over default values from the .FXB-file but not from the
FXCPX (i.e. not the values you saved from the CPX).

Without -t you have to give the 123/DM1/DM2 settings.
FLAGS: [1][2][3][I]
DFLAGS: D1 D2 D12
E.g.: setspeed -40 -12I -D2
      setspeed -36 -t     (takes default values).
      setspeed -20
