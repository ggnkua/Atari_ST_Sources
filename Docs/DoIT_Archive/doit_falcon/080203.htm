: Basically what I'm looking for is either a schematic diagram of the :
hardware, or details of people who sell/distribute it. I feel sure : that
it must exist somewhere, since I remember reading about it : several years
ago when I had my own Atari.


: Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated (or if you've got :
an Atari Hi-res monitor for sale, within England, please get in-touch)

          1.  INTRODUCTION
               The schematic described in this document converts the analog
          RGB video signal that is output by the ST to an NTSC composite
          signal which can be displayed on a colour or monochrome composite
          monitor, or on a TV set by adding a modulator. Please be careful
          when building the circuit.  Should anything in the schematics or
          this documentation seem suspicious, use your better judgement. A
          certain amount of experience at building electronic circuits will
          be very helpful. Also, a good oscilloscope and knowledge of the
          theory of RGB to composite conversion may be necessary in order
          to debug the circuit (should you have to). I have tried to pro-
          vide some background in this article.
          2.  AN_OVERVIEW
               The MC1377 RGB to composite video converter IC used does
          most of the work in converting the red, green and blue signals to
          composite video.  The red, green, blue, horizontal sync and vert-
          ical sync signals are taken from the ST and fed into the 1377. A
          colour burst carrier (3.579545 Mhz) is fed in from a separate
          oscillator [1].  The 1377 generates the R-Y, B-Y and luminance
          signals by passing the red, green and blue signals through a
           1.
              The separate oscillator is not really necessary since 1377
              contains a common-collector Colpitts oscillator which can be
              used to generate the colour-burst on-chip. However, I found
              it easier to generate the signal off-chip to make sure the
              thing is indeed oscillating.

          matrix.  Then, the B-Y signal is modulated using the colour-burst
          frequency carrier, and the R-Y signal is modulated using a 90
          deg. phase shifted carrier.  This results in the I and Q (in-
          phase and quadrature) components of the chroma signal. The two
          components of the chroma signal are added and amplified and made
          available on pin 13 of the chip. This allows the chroma to be
          band-pass filtered [2] externally and then fed back into pin 10.
          The band-pass filter should be centered at the colour-burst fre-
          quency and should have a bandwidth of about 1.6 Mhz. Not having a
          very good colour TV to experment with, I chose to do an el-cheapo
          filter since it wouldn't make any difference on my set anyway.
          (Besides, I plan to use my board on an old green-screen monitor
          to run an occasional colour-only program). A simple second order
          LC filter may be used. Set the resonant frequency of the tank to
          the colour-burst frequency, and choose an appropriate R so that
          you get the 1.6 Mhz bandwidth [3].  Introducing a second (or
          higher order) BPF to do chroma-filtering will probably result in
           2.
              If the chroma signal is not band-pass filtered, the low
              frequency components it contains (those components having
              frequency less than 2Mhz or so) will interfere with the
              luminance signal since it is very hard to put the chroma
              specral lines exactly in between the luminance spectral lines
              without any interference between the two.
           3.
              Note Filter bandwidth = Wo/Q, where Wo is the resonant
              frequency in radians/second (Wo=2*PI*3.15 Mhz) and Q is the
              quality factor required. Q=R*sqrt(C/L). A few filters are
              sketched in the Motorola Application Notes if you don't want
              to design one. A reference to these notes is in the appendix.

          a visible delay on the chroma-signal.  So, to make sure the
          colours are not offset from the B&amp;W image (like in sloppily
          coloured comic books), the luminance signal must be delayed an
          equal amount so that the luminance information is not ahead of
          the chrominance information.  To allow this, the luminance signal
          is looped out from pin-6 to pin-8. An approprate delay line
          inserted between pin-6 and pin-8 will create the required delay
          [4].  The luminance signal does not need any filtering.
          3.  INTERFACING
               The horizontal and vertical synchs from the Atari must be
          combined and fed into the composite synch input of the 1377
          (pin-2). The HSYNC and VSYNC are taken from the ST's monitor out-
          put, AND-gated and fed into the comp-sync input. This works fine
          since the syncs are active low, TTL level signals and satisfy the
          (-0.6V, 0.9V) active and (1.7V, 8.2V) inactive threshold levels.
               The colour signals, red, green and blue must be capacitively
          coupled through 22uF capacitors and attenuated through 2-4 Kohm
          resistors (in series with the input) so as to not interfere with
          the chip's bias and satisfy the 1Vp-p signal requirement respec-
          tively. All the three colour signals output by the ST have a
           4.
              The Motorola Application notes show how to hook up a TDK
              delay line if you need one.
          27 Dec 1986 (C) Anees Munshi 4
                       Atari RGB to Composite Video Converter
          1.8Vp-p range with a 1.2V DC bias. 1377 inputs: Pin 3: red input;
          Pin 4: green input; pin 5: blue input.
               The colour-burst carrier signal is generated as shown in the
          attached schematic and coupled to pin-17 through a 2.2Kohm resis-
          tor and a 0.1uF capacitor in series.
               The colour-burst is added after every sync pulse, (burst is
          not suppressed after VSYNC) approximately 5.5us (micro-seconds)
          after the sync's leading edge and it lasts for approximately 3us
          or 10.7 cycles of the carrier. This timing is done by an R-C
          timer in a fashion similar to an LM555 operating in astable mode.
          A 0.001uF capacitor is connected between pin 1 and ground, and a
          51Kohm resistor is connected between pin 1 and an 8.2V reference
          (available at pin 16).  When a sync occurs, the capacitor is
          unclamped from ground and begins charging through the 51Kohm
          resistor from 8.2V DC. When the capacitor voltage reaches 1.0V
          (approx 5.5us after the sync), the colour-burst carrier is gated
          on.  When the capacitor voltage reaches 1.3V, the colour-burst is
          gated off. The capacitor continues to charge until the voltage
          reaches 5.0V.  At this point, the capacitor is discharged to 0V.
          Clearly, by changing the RC values (and hence the time-constant),
          the burst can be made shorter or longer (8 cycles of colour-burst
          is the NTSC spec, but I don't think a slightly longer period will
          hurt (gives the PLLs in the receiver plenty of time to lock)). If
          the time constant (Time const. = R*C) is increased the burst will
          occur later and last for a longer time. The converse is true if
          the time constant is decreased. If the time-constant is made too
          27 Dec 1986 (C) Anees Munshi 5
                       Atari RGB to Composite Video Converter
          long, the ramp may not reach 5.0V before the next HSYNC, which
          will result in the some missing bursts (not too good).  If you
          feel like it, put a 50Kohm potentiometer instead of the 51Kohm
          resistor. You may be able to get some cheap special effects while
          calibrating the pot. :-)
               A chroma band-pass filter must be introduced between pins 13
          and 10 as mentioned before.  You may use the simple bandpass
          filter shown in the schematic, or to get better results, use one
          of the many shown in the Application Notes or design one your-
          self.  As mentioned before, if you design your own, the filter
          should have a bandwidth of about 1.6-2.0 Mhz and a center fre-
          quency of 3.58 Mhz. Since most colour TV's have a BW around 3
          Mhz, the BP filter will help reduce cross-talk between the lumi-
          nance and chroma components (on some TVs, you would never see the
          cross-talk in all the noise!). If your TV has a comb filter, you
          won't need a fancy BP filter (and the corresponding de lay line);
          in this case, the simple bandpass filter sketched in the
          schematic will do.
               Again, as mentioned before, if you do insert a fancy band-
          pass filter and see a noticeable shift between the outlines of
          objects and their colour fill, you will need to put a delay line
          between pin 6 and 8.  The Motorola Application Notes should help
          in this department.
               Pin 20 must be grounded to select NTSC operation [5].
           5.
          27 Dec 1986 (C) Anees Munshi 6
                       Atari RGB to Composite Video Converter
               Pin 19 provides the reference voltage for the voltage-
          controlled phase shifter (needed for I-Q phase shifting). It must
          be capacitively de-coupled to ground through a 0.01uF capacitor
          to provide a stable voltage reference at the pin. By pulling the
          pin up through a resistor to 8.2V, or by pulling it down through
          a resistor to ground, the axes can be tilted to get some colour
          adjustment (about 7 degrees, for a slight effect, according the
          application notes).
               A 12V power supply is to be connected to pin 14.  The power
          supply need not be regulated.
               The 8.2V DC reference voltage appears at pin 16.  A 0.1uF
          cap between pin 16 and ground will provide adequate filtering for
          this reference voltage.
               Pin 15 is the ground connection.
               Pins 11 and 12 are coupled through 0.1uF capacitors to
          ground.  By sourcing or sinking some current through these pins,
          whites may be made whiter and the blacks blacker (sounds like a
          detergent commercial) by compensating for the balanced modulator
          feedthrough thus.
               Pin 7 is coupled to ground via a 0.01uF capacitor.
              If pin-20 is connected to the power supply, PAL operation is
              selected.  For all you PAL hackers: If you replace the 3.58
              Mhz crystal with 4.43 Mhz crystal, and if you have a properly
              serrated vsync, you should be able to use this circuit to get
              PAL composite. If you do hack and get it working, please
              post.  (PAL is the colour system used in England, India and
              some other countries.)

               Pin 9 is the composite video output.  It has an output
          impedance of about 50ohms. To drive a 75ohm monitor input termi-
          nal, put a 25 ohm resistor in series with pin 9 and a 75 ohm co-
          axial cable.  Connect the other end of the co-axial cable to the
          monitor.

          4.  CONSTRUCTION
               You will need to buy a colour monitor cable from Atari [6].
          Start by cutting the cable in half. Then, strip about 2 inches of
          insulation off the end of the cable.  Now carefully remove the
          shielding without cutting the wires underneath.  This should
          expose 7 wires. Four of the wires are shielded themselves; these
          are the red, green, blue and audio out wires. Strip the shielding
          off these wires as well.  The following is a colour-code chart to
          help you find the wires:
                  colour of wire signal pin#
                  white RED output 7
                  red GREEN 6
                  black BLUE 10
                  yellow HSYNC 9
                  blue VSYNC 12
                  green AUDIO out 1
                  brown ground 13
           6.
              If this is not available, you may kludge one up as mentioned
              in the Abacus Internals book.)

                  The pins are labelled as follows (looking at the monitor
                  output plug from outside). Please test the cable with an
                  ohm-meter to see if my colour code is applicable to your
                  cable.
                  pin 4    0 0 0 0    pin 1

               Solder the cable onto the board you will be using, then
          solder or wire-wrap the circuit as shown in the schematic.  Try
          to keep the construction as clean as possible. Keep as much of
          the shielded cables shielded as you can. Try to RF shield the
          whole enclosure if you can. All the best.
