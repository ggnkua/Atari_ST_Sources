<p>claims that <a href="1304.htm" target="UDOcon">Videlity</a> is a perfect complement for <a href="0b02.htm" target="UDOcon">Nemesis</a>. Well, I
have both and I have to disagree. Don't get me wrong, <a href="1304.htm" target="UDOcon">Videlity</a> is a
superb piece of software, but it's not very well integrated with
<a href="0b02.htm" target="UDOcon">Nemesis</a>.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The most annoying problem is that <a href="1304.htm" target="UDOcon">Videlity</a> doesn't know when you
change the bus-speed. So if you run in a resolution that depends on
the system-clock, the screen will be totally messed up whenever you
switch bus-speed.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Also, <a href="0b02.htm" target="UDOcon">Nemesis</a> wasn't compatible with my <a href="0806.htm" target="UDOcon">ScreenBlaster</a> Inside
(Which wasn't very useful to me anyway, because of it's 50MHz clock.)
as both use the same control-lines. So when Geir &amp;Oslash;yvind
V&amp;aelig;lidalo came up with the idea to install a permanent
&quot;external&quot; pixelclock I just had to try it.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> You need...</b>
<br>
<br>- An oscillator of the desired speed.
<br>- Preferably a 14-pin DIL-socket.
<br>- Some pieces of wire.
<br>- Soldering tools.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> <a href="0204.htm" target="UDOcon">Installation</a> </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The installation is quite simple, you have to solder three wires.
If you don't bother with the socket, the wires are soldered directly
to the oscillator.
<br>
</p>
<p>Pin 14 of the socket is connected to the positive end of the big
smoothing capacitor next to the Videl.
<br>
<br>Connect pin 7 of the socket to ground, the negative end of the
smoothing capacitor is a perfect place.
<br>
<br>Connect pin 8 of the socket to pin 14 on the Videl. There's a
solder-pad &nbsp;5mm from this pin, this is the best place to solder.
Scrape the solder-resist coating away from the pad before you solder.
Make this wire as short as possible.
<br>
<br>Insert the oscillator in the socket (The right way please! Pin 1
is at the square corner.) and secure it with some tape. That's it! You
can now make new resolutions with <a href="1304.htm" target="UDOcon">Videlity</a>, just be sure to set
&quot;Dot clock&quot; to &quot;Ext&quot;. These resolutions will now
be entirely independent of bus speed.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>I've not used a socket in this installation, simply because I
didn't have one available at the time. The blobs covering the pins on
the oscillator is hotglue (for insulation and rigidity). The
oscillator is fixed to the PCB with double adhesive tape. As you can
see I haven't grounded the oscillator according to my own advise
(smoothing capasitor), but to the RF-modulator's shielding.
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Clock-speed </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>What clock-speed should you select? That's hard to say, as it
depends on your monitor. My lousy SVGA is very picky about
frequencies, and pixel-clocks above 40MHz is pretty useless to me. But
if you have a very good monitor you might want a 60MHz-clock or above
for really high resolutions.
<br>
</p>
<p>But remember, bandwidth is also an issue here. Too fast clocks
will stress the bus and slow down your Falcon considerably. I settled
for a 36MHz clock, which gives me a stable picture at 832x624 in 16
and 256 colours without using too much bandwidth.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Legal stuff </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>This modification works very well with my Falcon, and unless you
do something wrong, there's no reason it should do any harm. But just
in case: If you decide to to this modification, you do it entirely at
your own risk. I take absolutely no responsibility for any damage done
to either your Falcon, monitor or yourself!
<br>
<br><b> And remember, always disconnect the Falcon from the mains
when you open it! I once touched a live PSU with my nose (don't ask),
and it was - to quote Ford Fairlane - &quot;slightly amusing, but
mostly painful&quot;. </b>
