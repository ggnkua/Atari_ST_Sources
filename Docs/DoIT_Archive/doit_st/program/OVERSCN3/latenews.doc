                      Wowwww!


After 2 days of tracing my monochrome monitor SM124 circuit with my
scope it's done now:

I have just been modified it, so the SM124 now does
display the "more than HERCULES"-resolution of :

                720*480   pixel without distortion.

It's now possible to emulate the full Hercules standard MSDOS graphics
resolution of 720*348 pixels with the OVERSCAN ST.

I hope Avantgarde Software will include it soon into their PC-DITTO !
