The OVERROM.LST-file is a GFA-Basic program that modifies the 196
KBYTES of the new (EP)ROMTOS 1.4, so that the bug is fixed which was
still in it, that the scrolling of ASCII documents will not be anymore
distorted with using OVERSCAN or any big MATRIX-monitor.

To use the program You must read the contens of the ROMTOS 1.4 into
one 196 KBYTES long file and store it onto disk.

Then You start GFA-BASIC, load the OVERROM.LST and RUN it !
The bug inside the TOS 1.4 will then be fixed.
Then You can burn again Your EPROMS with this fixed TOS 1.4.
