900 rem I tapped this up quickly to help extract the tiles/blocks out from within each tile bank, from the missing link example files.  I went through each of these, then saved out a NEO file from SteemSSE.  Then I tidied them up in ST Paint, then exported a PNG file out to use with Tiled.  Probably an ugly/dirty method, but it got the job done!
950 rem The display of each tile bank is a bit messy.  In many cases where there were less blocks/tiles than within the actual dummy map file, you will find the tiles repeat, offset themselves and become scrambled.  I could eventually fix this problem, but didn't think it was necessary at this point.
1000 rem Copy the files EXTRACT.ASC & the folder called RESOURCE into the directory to where you want to extract any tiles from.  Change "BLOCKS.MBK" to the name of the tile bank.  Once finished, you can just delete the files afterwards.
1010 rem In some cases where there are landscape blocks & a landscape map in use, you may have to quickly swap out the world commands and use the landscape commands instead.  ie. change "world" to "landscape", and that's it.
