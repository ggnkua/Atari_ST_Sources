Basically you can use this program to convert CSV data (exported from Tiled) into Missing Link compatible maps to use with The Missing Link extension and STOS Basic.  You can also export CSV data out from existing Missing Link World or Landscape maps, TOME extension maps and AGT's *.CCM format.  The data can be imported into Tiled with a few additional steps.  The source code for both TOME2CSV (not publicly released prior) and AGT2STOS has been merged into CSV2STOS.

The latest version of CSV2STOS uses a menu driven system.  There were enough features added to warrant using this approach now.  It also helps pave the way for adding additional menu options in future.  Menus are great fun to program in STOS.  Knowing yours truly, I will probably re-arrange everything half a dozen times before releasing another version of this program.

CSV stands for comma-seperated value.  As well as this manual, there are also instructions within the program itself to follow through.  Once you get used to using each program feature, each process is pretty straightforward.  You will gradually learn why this program is so useful if you like using Tiled and the Missing Link Extension.

Small portions of code were borrowed from the original EDDY.BAS and reworked.  Like for example, when the program needs to generate a new map bank.  The file loading/saving routines were also borrowed and modified to suit each situation.  Thank you once again Jon S. Stock, for enlightening me on how to use data channels in STOS to read in or create new data using CSV files as the base format.  That was a huge help, it enabled me to work out how to write the first public release of this converter (v0.85).

So, the menu options;

View: 
- World Map
- Landscape Map
- World Blocks
- Landscape Blocks
- View NEO
- View PI1

There is a "View" menu now, with several options available.  The viewer allows you to view world maps, landscape maps, world blocks, landscape blocks, NEO or PI1 image files.  It's handy for quickly checking things, or viewing newly created maps for example.


Import CSV File:
- Make World Map
- Make Landscape Map
- Make Batch File
- Run Batch Converter

You can import a *.CSV file (exported from Tiled) into CSV2STOS, then create a World or Landscape map compatible with the Missing Link Extension.  You must know what the map's width and height are, so you can provide this information when instructed to do so.  Check within Tiled or your *.TMX file first, unless you have already memorised this information.

The batch converter tool is probably the best new feature in this version of CSV2STOS.  I found that while making new content for my own game engines, having to manually enter in data for more than 3-4 maps got rather tedious.  So I figured, why not do the whole lot in one hit?  In theory, you could do a whole massive bunch of them at once.  

It's now possible to set up and run a batch conversion script.  You can make a *.CSV description file using the option called "Make Batch File".  Or just use Notepad or VSC once you become more confident.  Once you have everything set up correctly, it will make life a lot easier.

The description file uses the following format:
map type (world is 1, landscape is 2), map width (in tiles), map height (in tiles), CSV input filename (*.CSV), map output filename (*.MBK)

Example of what is stored within a description file:
 1, 60, 110,BEN.CSV,BENWMAP.MBK
 2, 20, 60,CAR.CSV,CARLMAP.MBK
 1, 200, 25,CARNAGE.CSV,CARNWMAP.MBK
 2, 20, 112,DAMAGE.CSV,DMGELMAP.MBK
 1, 40, 40,ERIK.CSV,ERIKWMAP.MBK
 1, 80, 80,KID.CSV,KIDWMAP.MBK
 1, 100, 14,WIGGY.CSV,WIGYWMAP.MBK

Use the "Run Batch Converter" menu option when ready.  World or Landscape maps, ie. a mix of the two can be processed at the same time.  You could have two world maps to do, then one landscape, three world, etc., it doesn't matter which.  The program will read in your description file and batch run through to the end.  The map displayer has been disabled for this feature.  I have opted to display the batch file information and report on any progress made instead.

There is an example folder called BATCHRUN within the EXAMPLES folder.  Just use BATCHRUN.CSV as the main description file, then CSV2STOS will convert and output a series of example maps.  Have fun watching it do it's thing!  


Export to CSV:
- M.L. World Map
- M.L. Landscape Map
- TOME Map (*.MAP)
- AGT Map (*.CCM)

You can export a *.CSV file from an existing World Map or Landscape Map originally made with EDDY.BAS to use with Tiled, with a few additional steps required.  I recommend opening up a Tiled *.TMX map into Notepad or Visual Studio Code to familiarise yourself with how the file structure of a Tiled map works.  That way you will understand the next steps below a little better.  

Tiled doesn't allow for direct importing of CSV data yet, but the workaround is just to copy/paste the CSV data into a pre-prepared *.TMX file.  Just make sure the width and height values are set correctly in the *.TMX, and that the filename of your tileset (ie. *.TMS file made from a PNG image file) has been saved into the TMX file.  

You don't have to remove the spaces between the commas of a newly exported *.CSV file (Tiled doesn't seem to mind this), but do remember to remove the very last comma at the end of the data being pasted into your dummy *.TMX file.  Again a reminder, study the make-up of a *.TMX file saved from Tiled first in Notepad or similar before attempting this, then you will see what needs to match up.

Another important note, the CSV file you export from an existing missing link map with CSV2STOS.ACB cannot be re-imported back into CSV2STOS, then converted back into a missing link map file.  You have to export a CSV file from your Tiled map first and use this CSV data instead!  The id. # of each tile should then start from the correct point.  I may look into a fix/new option for this in a later version, but it's not really necessary currently as the program does it's job.  The idea is to get you into using Tiled for making/editing your game maps, then just export the CSV data back out again.

So, onto TOME and AGT.  CSV2STOS now has support for exporting CSV data from both TOME extension maps and AGT's *.CCM map format (which can be created using agtcut.exe).

TOME v2.0 (Total Map Editor) for STOS was written by Aaron Fothergill of Shadow Software in 1989.  I wrote a converter called TOME2CSV a while ago, but I hadn't publicly released it.  I thought it would be best to add the code into v1.00 of CSV2STOS.  This will allow anyone who happens to have kept any older TOME extension maps within their collection to convert these into CSV data.  Then you can copy/paste this data into a dummy *.TMX file and load it into Tiled, along with any tiles you have in a seperate image file converted to PNG format.  You can use Steem to export a screenshot of your tiles, or use ST Paint to help you with this task. 

AGT (Atari Game Tools) was written by Douglas Little (dml).  Development of AGT is ongoing and excellent results are being achieved.  The most recent effort from MST/masteries, being a complete playable demo of Mission 1 of a "Metal Slug" clone.  You can convert AGT's CCM map format to other formats, as the data is very easy to read in.  I decided to add the code from AGT2STOS into CSV2STOS, which I wrote a few weeks back.  So you can export CSV data out from a CCM map file from within CSV2STOS now.

Known bugs/issues:
There may be some "quirks" here and there, mainly regarding anything to do with making landscape maps or displaying landscape blocks.  So I recommend using CSV2STOS within the interpreter as an ACB file rather than running the program as a compiled PRG.  I have tried my best to provide warning messages or provide helpful workarounds.  

For example, it doesn't seem to be possible to read in the true block count beyond 256 landscape blocks within the viewer.  So if your file contains 386 blocks, you will need to key this total in manually.  The landscape block viewer should display everything correctly once this has been done.  

Concerning viewing tiles/blocks, tile 0 will fill out the screen currently.  So if tile 0 contains anything other than a blank space, you will see the tile repeated beyond the max. tile count within the file.  I will fix this later down the track.

It looks as though the block limit for World maps is 128 unpatched, or 256 with dml's patch applied.  For landscape maps it's 256 unpatched, 512 with the patch.

Examples of exported missing link maps to use with Tiled have been included, including PNG image files exported from the main *.TMX file(s).  These have all been retrieved from the original extension's examples.  I have added these to demonstrate what is possible with a bit of work.  They are also very interesting to look at in this context!

Speaking of which, if you are using an emulator, I recommend that you use Steem 3.2 or SteemSSE's fast forward button.  Otherwise you may have to wait a while for each map to convert.

----

Tip: Keep an *.MBK of your original tile sprites.  Also if possible, make both world blocks, landscape blocks and a PNG file of the same tileset.  You can generate an image of your tiles with make.bas, then use the SteemSSE emulator to quickly save off a NEO file, including a PNG or BMP of the image.  You may need to load the NEO into ST Paint (for the PC platform), tidy it up further and then save off a PNG image file.  It all depends.

Make sure these programs & extensions have been installed:
- Tiled
- Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice (so you can view and process CSV file data).
- ST Paint (for the PC, very nicely done!!)
- Photoshop or GIMP (optional, even ST Paint on it's own is fine)
- STOS v3.00 from Exxos's STOS Time Tunnel.  https://www.exxoshost.co.uk/atari/STOS_index.htm
- Misty Extension (Registered)
- The Missing Link extension (Registered)
- Preferably dml's patch for Missing Link to increase the available tile limit

The extensions mentioned above can be found at the STOS Time Tunnel.
