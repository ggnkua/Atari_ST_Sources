Music driver written by Gary Wheaton
used for driving your own music
or, as in this case,
commercial binary data.

This source code requires
Devpac assembler.

The music will run under one of the
vertical blank interrupt slots.

The slot chosen ($4de) is fairly
high up, so the routine is 
extremely sturdy when going
back to desktop or loading files
from disk.

To turn the music off, poke 
a long word ($0) in $200.
Poke $1 to turn on again.

To kill the v/b routine,
poke a long word ($0) in $4de
