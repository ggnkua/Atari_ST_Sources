What's GEMMA and how can I install it?



The GEMMA project is about getting GEM in STOS, but really it's more
then just that, in some ways it's going to create a totally new
programming language, combatible with STOS, but will use GEM, with a
real sourcecode editor with built in compiler/interpreter commands.

At the moment, GEMMA is an extension for STOS BASIC which allows you
to use GEM in STOS (hence the name). GEMMA is like any other
extension; all you have to do copy the extension to the STOS folder.
Once this is done GEM is available for you to use. However, since STOS
was programmed for non-GEM use, a special version of STOS (known as
GEMMA STOS) is being programmed. Check out Surely GEM in STOS is
impossible!? for more details.

However, the first version of GEMMA STOS has been produced. There are many ideas
for this new language. See GEMMA past, present &amp; future for
more details on the ideas.


What's this GEMMA group?


The GEMMA group is responsible for the programming of the extension in
68000 assembly machine code. The team includes...

What can you do with GEMMA?


Every GEM command available is coded. This means that it is fully
possible for you to program window dialogs, with menus and colour
icons. All the other extension that use STOS can also be used in
conjunction with GEMMA. Resource files, windows etc. can all be
used. Everything that you see in GEM programs can be used. An alertbox
is shown left, one of the first commands programmed in GEMMA.

By using the GEM commands, you can use and write the command
line. This means that you could use archievers, such as
STZIP. This means QWK viewers, shells etc. could be written. With
the command line alone you could write such things as HTML

creators. The window commands along with disk commands and
fileselector could let you create desktops shells (!).
That's only three commands I've just mentioned, put this together with
the HLLE's and, window dialogs etc. are all yours! GEMMA can now handle
Falcon resolutions! The alert box above was created in STOS with GEMMA
v1.35... in 256 colours! That's what GEMMA can do for you!

The latest versions of GEMMA STOS can even be used with MultiTOS!
Unfortunatly because STOS assumes to use the hardware directly, input
does not work correctly yet. The hope is that this can be fixed for
future versions.

Surely GEM in STOS is impossible!?



The orginal problem:
Many people thought like this for awhile, even some started laughing
at me when I said it was possible! Many of the commands in the table
above can be used with STOS v2.06. However, commands like 'rsrc_load'
use GEMDOS to get memory. Since STOS has nicked this memory a special
version of STOS is being created. This problem might not happen with
compiled versions of programs, I state might since we don't know what
STOS gets up to!

This is where GEMMA STOS comes in, programmed by our expert STOS
fixers. They rewrite the sourcecode to STOS, so that GEMMA and
STOS work perfectly together. If you download a copy of
GEMMA037.ZIP and try it you'll see that the
STOS arrow destroys everything in it's path. GEMMA STOS will have this
problem fixed, as well as other things such as STOS hogging up all
memory, which in GEM programming is dirty. Of course, your
favourite extensions will still work with this version of STOS, and
other extensions you hate too!

Like everything, it's not perfect. The major problems at the moment
are that the mouse isn't drawn correctly, programs cannot be
resolution indepent, and the memory problem. All the errors in STOS
should hopefully be fixed in the forthcoming versions of GEMMA STOS.
Until then, however, you are very much limited to the number of
commands you can use.


Although the idea of GEM inside STOS may be appealing to some, there are
several outstanding major issues which have not yet been address. I am
still dubious as to whether these can be overcome...

Also, adding the ability to use GEM will not improve compatibility due to
the existing problems caused by STOS.
- Anthony Jacques, April 1997


The next incarnation:

Since the last FAQ many things have
happened: all the GEM commands have been programmed and nearly all the problems
have been removed. I created the GEMMA accessory, which is
a way to avoid the problems for the time being. This accessory
reserves some memory on start up and copies the system variables into
it's own memory. When STOS runs, it overwrites these system ones, so
in STOS we overwrite it's own ones with the orginal system ones. Still
with me? Using this method we have given GEM as much memory as the
user wants, fixed the mouse problem, and the resolution. You can now
go into 256 colours on a Falcon, run STOS, and the autostarting GEMMA
program will put STOS into 256 colours so you can view GEM objects in
256 colours perfectly. The image you see to your top left is a window,
created in GEMMA with STOS, in 256 colours - the first of its kind!

Using GEM in STOS is pretty freaky, and when I first saw a 256 colour window
on the screen... I thourght I was in HBASIC with the desktop, it's that
realistic.


GEMMA STOS:

Although the extension hasn't changed that much since the last section, the
way you can access GEM has changed. I have now found how to get the system information
before STOS started in the actuall BASIC???.??? program. This means it is more
professional - because it is - the GEMMA acc is no longer needed, neither is initialisation
code, because there is a new command, initgemma which restores the screen to what it was
before STOS got it's hand on it!

The latest latest version (fresh from the assembler!) can already restore the mouse pointer
back! Also, GEMMA STOS doesn't assume it has all of memory, which makes future
multitasking compatibilty closer to reality.


Tell me more about the start of
GEMMA!


How did the project start? Well...

It was a dark, wet, winter afternoon near Christmas 1996. Michael
Wensley took his coat and shoes off having just arrived at Paul's
house.

Paul? I've got something to show you, said the 2nd GEMMA
member, before GEMMA had been invented, it's something to do with
STOS.

Michael loaded up this program into STOS...

The alertbox source

...and ran it.

Michael, is what I'm seeing possible?

You can see it can't you?

That was start of the project. Once Michael had convinced Paul it was
possible, he set about the start of the GEMMA extension, which at the
time didn't have a name. GEMMA got its name from GEM, obviously.
However, it did take some time to think of what the MA in GEMMA would
stand for, and later GEMMA became a acronym for Graphic
Environment Manager Multiple Advantages system. Nothing happened for
awhile, since the source to a STOS extension was not available to both
of them. The only thing that happened was a discussion about the fact
that it was possible for GEM in STOS was possible on the NeST (Network
ST).

This is where Simon Walton came in. He was the only one who took
interest on the project on NeST. We soon decided he would write the
documentation. About a month later the wheels started rolling for
GEMMA. Paul got Internet access and accidently stubbled onto Anthony
Jacques' homepage. What did they contain? The sourcecode to a STOS
extension. Anthony was very interested in the project. Paul then
joined the STOS mailing list, ran by Anthony himself (then).

At first, everyone doubted it. After awhile though, since of a few
comments about ridding of the STOS fileselector, people soon realised
what GEMMA meant, and what it could do for them...!



High Level Language Extensions (HLLE)


Using the basic commands on their own are fine to say the least, but
many wouldn't like to even start making a GEM program, having to check
for system messages etc. This is where the High Level
Language Extensions (HLLEs) come in. The GEMMA ones are
specially created by Anthony and Paul for you to use. Instead of
having to create your own functions to redraw formwindows, open them,
bring up the file selector, call SAM with SAA files, draw a textwindow
(a text file in a window), handle dialog boxes etc. these can be used.

All of these are can be accessed by the GOSUB command, and no
royalitees need to be payed.


G.E.M - V.D.I - D.I.Y?






The GEM system has two main features: the AES, the Application
Environment Services,
deals with the windows, icons, resource files, dialogs, menus and
pointers. The Virtual Device
Interface deals with
the 'primative' parts of the graphic system, ie drawing circles,
lines, plotting, area filling and drawing text. If you wanted to bring
up a dialog box, for example,
the AES part would be used, and if you wanted to draw a circle, the
VDI part would be used. Both parts of the GEM system are programmed in
GEMMA.

You have seen examples of the AES system all on this page, above is an
example of the VDI. The program listing is:


10 dummy=vsf_interior(1,1)
20 for A=0 to 256
30 vsf_colr 1,A
40 v_bar 1,X1,Y1,X1+10,Y1+10
50 X1=X1+10 : if X1>320 then X1=0 : Y1=Y1+10
60 next

This as you can see displays all 256 colours in a 256 colour Falcon
rez - in STOS!


How is GEMMA going to be released?


Of course, this being the GEMMA FAQ, you can download the version
latest RELEASED versions of GEMMA, from here.

By vote of the GEMMA team (we are so democratic on the GEMMA team!),
that GEMMA is now going to be released totally as
donationware, which means it will be
totally free. If you want to send contributions to the GEMMA team,
then please do so. Comments, of course, are always welcome (depending
if they are good or bad!). The compiler version will also be
donationware, to let the extension
spread as much as possible and encourage other people to use it.

(Erm Paul, you're a facist dictator - pretending to be a democracy! What next?! - Michael)


Is that all?


By all means no! Every version of GEMMA contains documents on each of
the programmed commands. GEMMA also has a expertly programmed built in
help system on every function with examples included in the help
function! Examples are included as ASC files too for convience.

The help system is now going to be a ACB, which means the text will be
shown in a dialog/formwindow and examples can be shown to the user as
he/she clicks around. The user can then also look at the source to see
how the HLLEs/GEM programs are programmed with.



What's the GEMMA logo?


The GEMMA logo is pictured at the top of this HTML file. The picture of the
model (Lenna) was taken from the STe Power CD Volume 1 from a
JPG viewer program, which was PD, and so this picture is also PD. Using
TrueImage, GEMview and ImageCopy 4CD, this was converted to the specific
size and pasted onto the orginal GEMMA logo.

All pictures of GEMMA examples were all made with GEMMA in STOS with my Falcon030.



What's this GEMMA pack?



GEMMA, as discussed earlier is being released as donationware. In the GEMMA achieve (known as the GEMMA pack when finished)
will be:


The latest version of GEMMA
Technical documents containing command syntaxs
The latest copy of the GEMMA FAQ in HTML format
Examples of, if not all, most commands
A detailed background of GEMMA
The latest version of GEMMA STOS
The latest constants file (all the numbers in the command
documentaion)
HASC - a program to convert .H file produced by a resource editor into
.ASC which you may merge with in STOS!


When GEMMA and the forthcoming GEMMA STOS are finished, you will be able to find copies
of the GEMMA pack(s) from the GEMMA download site.


Examples


These examples are displayed as small icons. To view the full sized image,
click on the icon.

This is the first
ever GEM window brought up in STOS. It is in ST-medium resolution and was created
with the first revision of GEMMA 0.65.




An example of the GEMMA formwindow routines. Created with GEMMA 0.65.




An example of a dialog box, created with GEMMA 0.65.




An ST-low res GEM window in action, created with GEMMA 0.98 (prior to the
GEMMA acc).




The fileselector. At last with GEMMA 0.98 (with GEMMA acc) you can use the
selector (or replacement), because memory can now be deallocated from STOS.



This is
a really great example of GEMMA in action. The following is taken from my Falcon030
running Multiblow, ImageCopy, ST-Guide, STiK, the Control Panel and AES 4.1.
There is a GEMMA formwindow there along with other windows. Created with GEMMA 1.65
(and GEMMA STOS)



The latest
in GEMMA programming. This is MultiTOS... with GEMMA in STOS!!!! Yes, it is possible,
THE FIRST GEM MULTITASKING APPLICATION IN STOS!. If you
know of any skeptics... show them this one!

As you can see, there are several applications running - Imagecopy, LINES.PRG
and the viewer program (with the GEMMA command list being shown). Also two
iconified windows... noticed the GEMMA example's name registered in the
Desk menu?
