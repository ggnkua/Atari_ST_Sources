Before I start I would like to thank Deano. If it wasn't for him then this 
document would not exist. Cheerz Deano me old mate. 
  
Okay then lets begin. What the extension does it kill the top and bottom 
borders. This extension only uses about 15 percent of stos's processor time so 
you have loads of time left to do other things. 
  
The extension dosn't work the way you would think it would. It dosn't add an 
extra 37 lines to the top and bottom of the normal screen. Instead it pushes 
the normal lines up 37 pixels and if you displayed a picture you would see 
it at the top off the screen leaving 74 blank lines. Because the new screen 
resolution is 64k or 64000 bytes long, displaying a 32k or 32000 byte screen 
would display lots of rubbish on the bottom 74 lines. To get rid of this you 
must draw a picture and then a second picture which only uses 74 lines. Copy 
the pictures to a bank and then display it on a hardware physical screen. 
Sounds very difficult to do but really it isn't. 
  
The below example should see you right. What it does is load a 32k picture 
and then copys the top 74 lines and adds it to the bottom of the picture to 
make it 274 lines in length. It then puts the new picture into a 64k data 
bank and then displays it on the hardware screen. I will take you through 
the following example to help you out. 
  
Before I do this let me tell you a few things. The extension works in low and 
medium resolutions. I don't know if works in high resolution. It should'nt 
do but you never know. 
  
Never use the missing links 'PALSPLIT', 'MUSAUTO COMMANDS', or 'SAMPLAY' 
commands as they mess up the extension and cause a crash. You can play sample 
if you have an STE as the DAC chip handles the samples. Use the STE extension 
to play STE samples. If you want to play chip music then use the music example 
I have provided on this disk. If you play tracker music then the whole system 
will just be screwed up totally. 
  
Because stos's keyboard and mouse drivers are shite to say the least it means 
that if you move the mouse or type on the keyboard then the screen will 
flicker like mad. If you use the missing links 'HARDKEY' command then you wont 
get any flicker. You can't however, use the mouse. Sorry its not my fault, 
blame Mandarin Software. Do not use the 'INKEY$' command as you may get a 
crash and it dosn't work with with extension anyway. Make sure you have a form 
of exit. You can't use 'CONTROL + C' to exit. 
  
The extension has one command which can take one of two parameters. 
BORDY 1 turns the extension on and BORDY 0 turns the extenion off. 
  
10 curs off : click off : key off : flash off : hide on : mouse off : mode 0 
20 rem The above line turns off the cursor, the keybord click, the menu, 
       the flashing, the mouse and puts stos in low resolution. 
  
30 if length(5)=0 then reserve as datascreen 5 : load "techno.neo",start(5) 
40 rem The above line loads a picture into bank 5 ready for use. It also 
       detects if a picture is still in bank 5. 
  
50 reserve as work 6,64000 : S5=start(5) : S6=start(6) 
60 rem Reserves a 64k bank as bank 6. S5 is the variable for the start of 
       nak 5 and S6 is the variable for the start of bank 6. 
  
70 copy S5,S5+32000 to S6 : copy S5,S5+32000 to S6+32000 
80 rem The above line copys the picture to bank 6. It then copys the picture 
       a second time and then pastes it at the bottom of the original picture. 
  
90 get palette (5) 
100 rem Gets the right palette. 
  
110 Y=0 
120 rem Sets the variable Y to 0. 
  
130 physic=start(6) 
140 rem Tells stos that the pictures in bank 6 is the physical screen. 
  
150 bordy 1 
160 rem Yeah. The above line turns the extension on. 
  
170 repeat : wait vbl 
180 rem Repeats the following code and waits for a vertical blank. 
  
190 SC=start(6)+(Y*160) 
200 rem Gets ready to display the picture. The SC variable is set so that 
        when the screen is displayed it can be scrolled up or down. 
  
210 if jup and Y>0 then Y=Y-8 
220 rem If you move the joystick up then the hardware screen will move up 
        by 8 lines. 
  
230 if jdown and Y<140 then Y=Y+8 
240 rem If you move the joustick down then the hardware screen will move 
        down by 8 lines. 
  
250 physic=SC : until fire 
260 rem Displays the screen on the physical screen. Also if you press fire 
        then the program exits. 
  
270 bordy 0 
280 rem Turns off the extension. 
  
290 default : end 
300 rem Turns everything back on and exits the program. 
  
  
I hope this extension will make your programs look better. If you do use this 
extension then send me a copy of your game or program or whatever. If you do 
then I will send you loads of good stuff. You don't have to credit 
'ORBITAL SOFTWARE' if you use the extension, but if you do then I will love 
you forever (ergh). No but seriously, please credit us because its nice to 
have your name credited somewhere in a scroller.
