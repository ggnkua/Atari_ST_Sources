It is also for optimising the shapes before use in my 3D STOS driver.

Let me explain...

	CAD-3D 2.0 outputs shapes in an unusual format. Everything is
Built from little triangles. This is excellent for accurate depth-sorting
and getting lovely pictures and anims (CAD's main use), but not much cop
when you want to move a big shape at a reasonable frame-rate. So this
program lets you turn the little triangles into larger polyhedra. i.e.
squares and other interesting shapes. This reduces the number of polygons
per object, speeding up the display rate.

	This process is, unfortunately, not automatic. You have to do it
yourself. But this program makes it easier.

	The idea is to find a set of triangles occupying one surface.
you then DELete one of the outer triangles, move to the next one
and click on EXPand until that polygon fills the hole the previous one
left behind. Once the hole is filled. click on EXPand DONE.

	Now move to the next triangle (if there are any left) and delete IT,
expanding the PREVIOUSLY expanded SQUARE to fill that hole as well.
eventually you will have expanded one of the triangles to fill the whole
surface. (There are normally only 2 triangles per surface but some complex
shapes can be REALLY weird!)



	You can load CAD objects, recolour them, optimise them and save them
as the four *.X,*.Y,*.Z and *.S files used by the 3D STOS driver.

Only use the first 16 colours for colouring. The last few are NOT supported
by the 3D STOS extension and WILL CRASH IT!!! these are bitmapped fills and
will be added later on. To colour a surface, use Z/X to pick surf and
click on colour bar to set the colour. Palettes may be loaded.



KEY GUIDE...

	CURSORS,INS,DEL	-	rotate object
	UNDO			-	undo last deleted surface (be careful)
	Z/X			-	advance through surfaces

LIGHTSOURCE MODE...
	
	F1,F2,F3,F4		-	change ambient and direct light intensity



	Feel free to distribute this program but please leave it
	and the documentation in it's current form.
