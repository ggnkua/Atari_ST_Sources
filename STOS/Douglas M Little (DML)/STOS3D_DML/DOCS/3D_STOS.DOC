
	This is a simple 3D extension for STOS. It is not as good as
the real STOS-3D extension, but is perfectly useable for simple demos
and games.

	On this disk is a STOS BASIC listing which displays a CAD-3D 2.0
object directly on screen. It is partially commented and is quite short.

The idea is this... 
	
	The program loads the 3D extension (3D_250.PRG) into bank 15 and the
optional fast clear-screen routine (CLS.PRG) is loaded into bank 14.
the program then sets up a variable array ('I') containing the relevant
info to be passed to the 3D driver. This includes the bank containing the
source object and four empty banks for the x,y,z and surface lists.

The array element 'COM' (COMMAND) tells the driver what to do when called.
We first set this to 0. This means that when the driver is called, it will
convert the source object into the 4 banks passed to it. (These banks may
be saved seperately to disk if needed, since it saves needing to convert
the object every time you want to display it in STOS.)

Once we have converted the shape, the original 3D object is useless, and
the bank (bank 15) may be released for later use. The 4 other banks now
contain the object data in the correct format for display.

The array is now filled with the data for the position and orientation of
the shape, clipping coordinates and other 3d-related stuff.

**---------------****------------------*******-----------------************

The screen can be cleared using

	cls logic
	
Or by using the CLS.PRG in bank 14

	10 areg(0)=logic : call 14

**---------------****------------------*******-----------------************

To display the shape, put the screen address into the array...

	10 I(SCREEN)=logic

pass the address of the array into a0...

	20 areg(0)=varptr(I(0))

and call the driver.

	30 call 15
	
**---------------****------------------*******-----------------************

To rotate the object, do something like...

	10 I(X_ANGLE)=I(X_ANGLE)+5 : I(Y_ANGLE)=I(Y_ANGLE)-3
	
or something similar. Use your imagination.

Please remember, this is a home-written(!) piece of code which is NOT
part of the STOS family. If you want REAL 3D in your STOS code, get
the proper STOS-3D extension from MANDARIN.

This is fast code and has very little error trapping. If you make a mistake
it will probably crash. So, BE CAREFUL!!

	Happy 3D!!!!
