SPECCODE is a machine code program
which enables the users of the STOS
Games Creator to show SPECTRUM (SPU) 
picture files from within the STOS
environment. (512 colours for normal 
ST's and 4096 colours for STE's)


(SPU uncompressed picture files are
generated from such packages as
SPECTRUM 512 (ANTIC PUBLISHING) and
ROMBO's VIDICHROME-ST digitizer etc.)


IT WILL ONLY RUN FROM WITHIN STOS
AND REQUIRES A COLOUR MONITOR/TV!

First boot up your STOS system as
normal then load and list
"EXAMPLE.BAS" for instructions.


******** SHAREWARE MESSAGE *********

SPECCODE.PRG is shareware and may be
freely copied provided that the files
README.DOC and EXAMPLE.BAS reside with

Limitations

While the ST is showing this number
of colours on screen it is operating
close to the limit of its available
processing power. This means that
any other tasks called at the same
time will run slow or just not work.
(This applies only when an SPU picture
is on screen - STOS returns to normal
as soon as the picture disappears)
 
Sometimes glitches can occur due to
the ST's processor and graphics chips
being out of sync. They appear as a
series of small "holes" in the picture
and a cold reboot should remedy this.
