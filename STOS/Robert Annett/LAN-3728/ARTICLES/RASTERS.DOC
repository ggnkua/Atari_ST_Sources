          Well  hello  and welcome to my  second  little  article.  
There isn't a lot of news and stos 3D has still not arrived and  I 
have been told never will for the ST.  However one thing you might 
be  interested  in  is that Goodmans PD has  now  started  a  stos 
shareware  service  and  have many stos  titles.  They  have  also 
recently  run a programming competition so I hope you all  entered 
it.   Also recently there has been a new stos upgrade to make your 
version of stos TT and mega STE compatable. This is available from 
most PDL's and is disk  GD489 from goodmans. Anyway enousquare,  circle, brush, zoom etc.  One of the best features is the 
magnify  one.  This  means you can inspect a part of  the  drawing 
close  up draw the fine detail and then it is shrunk back down  to 
size in the right spot. My only critisisms are that some functions 
run quite slow,  sometimes annoyingly so, and that the way you set 
up extra colours is difficult.
          The  routines supplied show that although  the  pictures 
produced  are of superb quality so much processor time is used  up 
it means that it couldn't be used in a game. I think it's best use 
would be for a static intro picture or a high score table. 
          I  don't agree with ratings out of 10 but if you have  a 
spare  15  quid then it will certainly help you brighten  up  your 
games. Recomended.

          
               Quick tip \ Bug spot

          Well  something  I have found out is  that  although  in 
basic  you  can  save and load  .VAR   files   when  compiled  the 
program  won't load them up. To get round this poke  all  variable 
values into a databank then bsave this. You can then bload this up 
and peek to get them out.
