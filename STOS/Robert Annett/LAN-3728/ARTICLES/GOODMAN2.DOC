                      A Small Stos Source!

     By Robert Annett


          Welcome to a STOS update for the Goodmans catalogue. In 
order to make it a bit more interesting than just a list of disks 
there are a few little bits of stuff on here. This is one of them. 
Below is a small source that you can easly type in a few short 
minutes that I hope you will like the look of. It works OK in 
basic but please try compiling it (on compiler tests off) to see 
it in full swing. I think you will agree that it is one of the 
smoothest pure STOS horizontal star fields around.


10 dim X(100),SP(100),SV(20000) : NO=0
20 key off : curs off : hide on : mode 0 : update off : flash off :
 logic=back : auto back off 
30 for I=0 to 100 : X(I)=rnd(315)+4 : SP(I)=rnd(3)+1 : next I
40 for I=0 to 320 : for A=0 to 49 : X(A)=X(A)+SP(A) :
 if X(A)>319 then X(A)=X(A)-319
50 SV(NO)=X(A) : inc NO : next A : next I
60 doke $FF8240,$0 : doke $FF8242,$333 : doke $FF8244,$444 :
 doke $FF8246,$555 : doke $FF8248,$666 : wait 100 : LP=0
70 rem LOOP --------
80 for I=0 to 49 : plot SV(I+LP),I*4,SP(I) : next I : LP=LP+50 :
 if LP=15950 then LP=0
90 screen swap : wait vbl : cls logic,0 : goto 80


          The reason this star field is so fast is that all the 
star position are precalculated. This causes a small delay between 
when you run it and when the stars appear but this is a small 
price to pay.  Lines 10-20 is just the simple start up code which 
is no problem to understand. Line 30 randomly chooses the x 
positions (array X) and speeds (array SP) of 100 stars. Lines 
40-50 are the lines that do all the precalculation and this is 
done  by adding the correct speed to the x position, saving this 
value (in array SV) and when working out the next position and 
saving this etc. Line 60 changes the colour palette to the 
required one. The reason I have done it this way is because I have 
found in the past that it gives me the least problems (believe it 
or not). It works by doking the colour palette directly into the 
hardware. Line 80 plots the stars on the screen and does this by 
taking the x value out of the presaved array. As you will have 
spotted I do not use predefined y positions because I simple plot 
stars every 4 pixels down. The colour plotted is defined by the 
respective speeds of the stars. This is because the slowest ones 
will look the furthest away and so should be the darkest. 
Therefore all I need to do is to have colour 1 as the darkest, 
number 2 as slightly lighter etc. Line 90 just screenswaps to 
display the screen and clears the logical one to redraw for the 
next frame. Then it wraps to line 80!
          This code will also on the new version of my source disk 
(blatent plug) disk BAS 31 (I think). I case any of you are 
interested the disk magazine STEN now has a regular STOS section 
to it which is aimed at the very beginner. This started issue 9. 
Thanks for reading this, so until next time keep on stosing.
