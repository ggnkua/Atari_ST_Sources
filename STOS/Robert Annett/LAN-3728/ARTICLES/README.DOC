  
     All of the articles on here were written by me for the 
magazine  STupendous for the Atari ST Users Association. 
Unfortunately this magazine is no longer being produced so all 
articles are now on this disk.
     If you want to write to me (Robert Annett) about  programming 
either STOS or assembly you can get me at
