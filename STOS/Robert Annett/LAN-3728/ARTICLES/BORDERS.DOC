                    THE STOS PART (OF THE MAG)

     By Robert Annett 

          Hi again everybody. Again not a lot of news to tell  you
this month but  next time I should be able to tell you the  result 
of  the  goodmans stos competition and maybe even do a  couple  of 
reviews of the winning programs.  Having recently recieved a  copy 
of  the  stos tracker I will do a review of it in this  issue  and 
maybe see if it can be included on the disk of the next issue. And 
now for the infamous programming part. (Review later)
          This will be my last article that is directly to do with 
the raster beam (but hopefully not my last article!!).  This  will 
be  about  removing  borders.  Don't expect to be  able  to  do  a 
conversion of the level 16 fullscreen demo with this though!!       
          Removing borders is actually quite easy.  Basically when 
ever  a  border needs to be drawn one of the ST's  chips  sends  a 
little  signal  to tell the video chip to draw one.  To  remove  a 
border  you need to jam this signal.  Now one thing that will  jam 
this signal is changing frequency.  ie changing from 50hz to  60hz 
and  then back  again.  So all you need  to do is  wait until  the 
signal  is  about to be sent and  then  quickly  flip frequencies.
          The  top  border is  drawn  right  after the vbl, so all 
that  is  needed  is  a wait vbl command and  then  you  can  flip 
frequencies.  This  will push the normal 32k screen into  the  top 
border.  (See border.bas) .   To remove the bottom border the flip 
has to be done just before it is drawn ie 6/7 of the way down  the 
screen.  The way this is done in stos is by waiting using a for  i 
loop.  (see border2.bas).   
          Now how do you actually flip the frequencies? Stos has a 
frequency  command that will do this but unfortunatly this  cannot 
be used inside a program.  So like creating rasters you will  need 
to poke directly into the hardware. It could also be done by using 
a trap call but by poking it is faster.  In the program to  remove 
the top border the two pokes (one to go 50hz + one to go 60hz)  go 
either side of the wait vbl command.  In the lower border one they 
go after the for i loop.The first frequency change here is  before 
the signal is sent (50hz - 60hz) and the second one (60hz to 50hz) 
goes after it should have be sent.  This means it is jammed and if 
there is no signal there is no border.  Examples are on the disk. 



                    Quick Tip
     
          To  check  how much processor time you have  left  in  a 
program  use  a rasters line to indicate how  many  scanlines  you 
have used up. ie 

     10 rem your program. Note: must run at 50 frames a second
     20 doke $ff8240,$777:rem change back to white
     30 wait vbl: rem wait remaining screen time
     40 doke $ff8240,$0: rem change to black
     50 goto 10

          The  white  area  at the bottom of  the  screen  is  the 
remaining  time that you have left in that vbl.  This routine  can 
be  used to test to see which routines to do a certain process  is 
fastest. ie test differing 3D routines.

               The Review (Wow)

Title: STOS Tracker
Distributer: Any good PDL
Price: From œ2.50 upwards

          Well you have to admit that the ST sounds isn't as  good 
as the amiga's.   No of course you don't!!!!!  Recently there have 
been many programs released that allow you to produce music on the 
ST that is far better than that of the amiga.  After all the amiga 
replays  soundtracker music normally at 8.3Khz but many of the  ST 
ones  play  at  up  to 50khz and most  at  least  play  at  10khz. 
Unfortunatly  most  of  these programs do not  have  a  method  of 
replaying these great bits of music in stos.  So stos tracker  was 
written to allow you to do this.
          How  sucessful has it been?  Well it does allow  you  to 
replay  soundtracker files through stos but only  converted  amiga 
ones.  So to write your own you will need an amiga (no way) or get 
another soundtracker.  I suggest the noisetracker.  The best thing 
is  that these files (if you can get them) are played on  interupt 
so you can use them as background music.  The only problem here is 
the large amount of processor time it uses.  In fact it is so slow 
that  if  you  use it ,whatever is on the screen  should  be  very 
simple  leaving  time for the tracker.  The commands  to  use  the 
tracker  are simple enough and seem to be quite powerful but  some 
of  the  other stos commands don't seem to like  it  at  all.  For 
instance  the wait command often causes a lot of bombs  when  used 
while the music etc is playing.
          The worst thing must be that the quality leaves a lot to 
be desired.  It is a lot (and I mean a lot) better than the normal 
chip  stos  music  but it is not as good  as  normal  soundtracker 
music.  Even files that sound good through the noisetracker lose a 
lot of quality and pick up a hiss when used with stostracker.
          So what is the verdict?  For œ2.50 you should all get it 
at once even though it suffers from problems. You should use it on 
simple  intro sequences for a game but unless it is a no  movement 
logic puzzle game forget about using it as in game music.

          Thanks  for  reading  this and if any of  you  have  any 
problems/suggestions/queries/money/property then please send  them 
to me.
