                           STOS SECTION

By Robert Annett


          Well  then what news is there in the stos world.  Not  a 
lot!  The results to the goodmans competition should have  reached 
those  who entered a while ago and hopefully in the next issue  of 
stupendous  I will be able to review the  winning  programs.  Many 
thanks to Oskar in Sweden who wrote to me to ask about stupendous. 
He saw my articles on a disk from Goodmans.  Anyone who wants  the 
back  issues of the programs from my collum can get them  on  disk 
BAS 31.  Well enough of that little plug and onto the  interesting 
part.

          A small but impressive little effect that everyone could 
use in there programs is the sine wave.  Most people like to  sine 
wave their logo in the title screen of a game or demo,  but I have 
seen  some very poor source for doing this,  so I have decided  to 
give you a decent one.  First of all what is a sine wave? You have 
all seen an example I am sure somewhere but how is it done?   Sine 
is  mathematical function that allows you to solve  problems  with 
triangles  however we will not use it for this.  Basically if  you 
have  a  number and sine it (try it on a calculater)  it  will  be 
changed into another number.  Now if you sine the numbers 1 to  90 
and then plot this on a graph you will have plotted a curve.  When 
on  a computer we copy a block of screen with a sine wave what  we 
do is copy it so that it follows this curve.  This is done  simple 
by changing the x co-ordinate according to this curve. If after we 
have  done this once we change the sine equation slightly  we  can 
give the block a 'ripple'.
          So  now that the maths lesson is over  children  ,  give 
teacher an apple and go home.  Oooooops, sorry I got a bit carried 
away there.  Anyway in stos we are lucky enough to have a function 
called  SIN.  That  is  a shortened name for sine so  do  not  get 
carried  away  having  a good sin on your  computer. To  get  this 
function to work all you have to do is  VAR=sin(no.) where no.  is 
the number that you want to be sined.  If we set up an array  then 
we  can have this sin(no) in a for next loop and set up the  curve 
that we need.  eg.

10     Dim V(580):for i=0 to 90:V(I)=sin(I):next i


          This  will  set  up  an array with  sine  values  in  it 
however  the  individual numbers are too variable to use  to  copy 
a  screen  block onto.  There for we have to  change  the  numbers 
slightly . eg.

10     Dim V(580):for i=0 to 580:V=sin(i*pi/90)*16:next i

          The '/90' in the bracket controls how many ripples there 
will be in the block and the '*16' outside controls the  magnitude 
of the ripples.  The number inside the bracket must be a factor of 
360 (ie 30,90,180) but if is too small the picture will become  so 
distorted you will not be able to see it.
          If we copy the picture onto the logic screen one line at 
a  time  in a for next loop so that each line uses the  next  sine 
value  then there will be a static curve in it.  If however we  do 
this  but  on  the  next frame the value  for  each  line  is  the 
same  as the line below it on the last frame,  then the sine  wave 
will  go up the picture and it will  'wobble'.  This  is  achieved 
with 


50     for I=0 to Y : screencopy  6,V(I+P)-16,I,X,I+1 to logic 0,I 
: next I : P=P+10 : if P=360 then P=0

          In this example Y is the number of lines down your block 
is and X is it's width.   As P gradually get larger the sine  wave 
wobble will move up the block. Change P=P+10 to P=P+5 to make this 
slower.
          There  is a simple  example of how this is done  on  the 
disk along with some other more complicated examples.      

 
               Demo Review :


          As  there seem to be quite a few demos written  in  stos 
going around at the moment I thought that I would briefly  comment 
on  some of them.   Most stos demos are simple sample and  picture 
affairs such as the phantom of the opera by Lost K. There are many 
dozens  of these but I tend to dislike them.  The best one  though 
must be french kiss by Richard Hollins.  The first stos megsdemo I 
ever saw was the big stos demo by Richard Gale.  This is now  very 
outdated and even at the time I didn't think all that much of  it. 
Also  released  near that time was the (again) big stos  demo  but 
this time by Zogg. This was again simple but it did have the first 
ever palette split in stos. 
          A demo called 'Into The Trashcan' was the first one from 
Rasterat and was a fun demo with a full game on it. Soon they also 
released 'The rasterat demo machine' and 'stos coma'  which had  a 
few  good bits on.   Recently there have been some very good  stos 
demo  released of which the best are 'Better than life'  and  'Cor 
Blimey' by ACO and STORM respectively.  These both have some  very 
good  screens in and are worth getting.  ACO have also released  a 
demo called 'Pandoras box' which is much simplier than their other 
one.   Soon  however  there will be released 'The  Cunning  Demos' 
which has screens by ACO,  STORM and many other people in  it.  It 
will be by far the best one ever programed so watch out for it.  I 
have had a sneak preview of it and it's GOOD!! 

                    QUICK TIP / BUG SPOT

          One  error in the stos manual is in the  description  of 
the  shift  command.  This does NOT rotate the entire  512  colour 
palette into the colours used on screen as the manual  says.  What 
it  does is cycle the 16 colours in the same way that the  animate 
function on Degas does.          


          Thanks for reading all this stuff and if any of you want 
to write to me for any (good) reason please write to.
