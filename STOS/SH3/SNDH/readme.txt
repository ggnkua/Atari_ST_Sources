That nice chap GGN made gwEm/Swe's GFA sndh player work with STOS so I could have music in my game - what a guy!

Here's a few lines of code, the hax0rd binary & an example tune so you can have a play. Oh, the music starts off quiet - it does work, just give it a sec.

Once again, big up the G-man! ;)
