                          CHAPTER TWO
                   Planning an adventure game
  ****************************************************************** 

  Like any other game an adventure has to be planned out on paper, 
  this chapter is dedicated to showing you how its done.  We are
  going to look at how St brides was written as an example.

  The first thing we need to think of is what the game is going to 
  be about, what will the main character be and what does he have 
  to do in our adventure. We then need to create a fantasty world 
  for him or her to do it in.

  Looking at St brides we see that the main character is a normal  
  everyday schoolgirl, the created fantasty world is the inside of 
  a school and her task is to get out of the school.

  We now need to make a list of the locations or places we are 
  likely to encounter in our created world, for example the list 
  of locations in a school would look something like this.

  1. Headmasters office.
  2. Dinner hall.
  3. Caretakers office.
  4. Main hall.
  5. Boys toilet.
  6. Girls toilet.
  7. Classroom 1.
  8. Classroom 2.

  So here we have eight locations making up the inside of a school 
  you could also add other locations such as a staffroom or an 
  assembly hall for example.

  Now we have our locations we can connect them together like this.

     ****************                ************
     * classroom 1  * -------------- * corridor * 
     ****************                ************
       LOCATION 1                    LOCATION 2

  Connecting locations is like drawing a map, you connect your 
  location to the nearest one. In the above example the nearest 
  location or place from the classroom would be a corridor. As 
  above you would draw a small box with the name of the location 
  in it on paper along with its location number.

   For practise why don't you draw a map of your own house with 
   small boxes repesenting each room in the house and drawing 
   lines in between them to connect them together.

                            CONNECTIONS
  ******************************************************************

   Connections are just a way of getting from one room to another, 
   This is done by the normal compass directions (north,south..ect) 
   when you want to go somewhere in an adventure land you would 
   normally type "go north" or "n" for short.

   In St brides the first location description says there is a door
   that leads north. This location is the bedroom of the main 
   character and this is connected to the corridor. So what you 
   are doing is deciding which direction leads out of that 
   location and into the next one, the nearest.

   Imagine yourself in a school corridor. In that location you 
   could see three different places to go, so your map of the 
   corridor would point to three different locations which could 
   be a classroom, a staffroom and the headmasters office. You 
   could then decide that the main character would have to go 
   north to enter the classroom or east to enter the staffroom.

   Now remember when you enter a location using a direction you 
   need to use the oppisite direction to leave, for example if you 
   go north into the classroom you would have to go south to 
   leave it and re-enter the corridor. Or you could go east to the 
   staffroom and west to come back to the corridor.

   Just like the rooms of a building locations apply to the 
   outside of the building like a village or a forest. Connections 
   for a village location could be north to a forest. In this case 
   the connections from the forest would be south to the village.

   Not all locations would be connected to each other, you may 
   decide that your character has another way of getting there 
   like traveling by car or stepping through a magic mirror.

   After all this your plan could be written down like this....

   1. HALLWAY (n=2,s=3,w=4)
   2. BEDROOM (s=1)
   3. BATHROOM (n=1)
   4. STAIRCASE (e=1)

   As you can see, the first location is an hallway which leads to
   three other locations. The information in between the brackets 
   are the connections (exits) from that location. So our main 
   character can go north to the bedroom (location 2) from the 
   hallway. The letters are the first letter of the direction and 
   the number is the number of the location it is connected to.

   Here is a list of directions sac uses............

   n=north  s=south  w=west  e=east  u=up  d=down  nw=northwest
   ne=northeast  sw=southwest  se=southeast.

         Connections will become clearer as we move on.

                          OBJECTS
  ***************************************************************

   Objects are normal everyday items that can be picked up and 
   used or just moved to another place like a torch, a piece of 
   clothing or even some food and drink. Our character may be a 
   knight whos task is to save a princess from a dragon, in which 
   case he would need a sword and shield.

   An object could be created and put in a certain location 
   waiting for the player to find it or it could be carried or 
   even worn. You could decide what objects are needed by the main 
   character and write it down like this.....

   1. TORCH (found at location 2)
   2. COAT  (worn)
   3. KNIFE (carried)

   So judging by the plan, our first object (the torch) can be 
   found by the player at location 2 (the hallway).

   Most adventure games allow the player to examine a carried 
   object. The game would normaly give him a description of the 
   object, for example typing "examine sword" would result in the 
   game printing up "The sword is sharp with a golden hilt."

   Other times an object could reveal something like examining a 
   jug and finding a key inside. This is known as a reveal examine
   command where one object is found in another. Normaly the sac 
   editor would just print up the normal examine message so the 
   reveal messages are kept separate. See chapter 4 for a example.

   Examine also applies to examining part of the current location 
   that is'nt an object. As above this can be a normal or reveal 
   command where reveal is treated separate. Don't worry about 
   this for now as it will be discussed in chapter 3.

   If you have subscriped to sac you will have recieved chapters 
   5 and 6. Chapter 5 will tell you about adding extras such as 
   characters and samples and other clever routines.

   Well thats mainly how adventures are planned. As we move on we 
   can add extras to the plan like game messages and high priority 
   commands and the special commands like reveal.

   In chapter 3 we shall discuss using the sac data creator.
