                           CHAPTER ONE
                    What is an adventure game?    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
   This chapter is mainly for people who have never even seen an
   adventure game before, so if you know all about adventures then 
   you may skip this chapter and read the following ones.

   Adventure games come in different forms, they can be mouse or   
   keyboard controlled. Sac is a keyboard control creator.

  There all loads of keyboard control adventure games in PD
   librarys like "The elven crystals" for example. This type of
   game plunges the player into a world of fantasy where anything
   could happen and the computer would act upon the players command.
   The standard text adventure would look something like this....

  You are in a small clearing. The sun shines its glow upon the   
  flowers in a nearby field which stands to the north. To the
  distance south is a small cottage with a nice garden and to the  
  west you can see the dark forest.

  So this is what an adventure game is, Just a blank screen with   
  words on it. The computer acts as your eyes and ears and tells you
  what you see and hear by displaying the words on the blank 
  screen. In the above example the computer is telling you that 
  you are in a small clearing and that you see a cottage and a
  forest. This is called the location description and all adventures
  are made up of these, a list of locations which
  make up a game world.

  Of course you will need a way of getting from one location to   
  another, so the locations are connected together which allows you 
  to move to that location by telling the computer to move you there.

  Lets take a normal bedroom for this example, this could be the   
  first location in the adventure.

  You are in your bedroom. Your posters hang on the wall and your  
  Hi-fi sits in the corner. The hallway is north.

  As you can see, the first location is your bedroom and as the   
  nearest location is the hallway then this would be the second
  location. The location description tells you that the hallway is 
  to the north, so how do we move to the hallway?

  After the location description the computer will display an
  input cursor, it will then wait for you to command it, so the 
  screen would look something like this......

  You are in your bedroom. Your posters are on the wall and your   
  Hi-fi sits in a corner. The hallway is north.

  >_

 You command the computer by typing in your command, so to move 
  to the hallway you could type.....

  >go north_

 You would then press the return key and the computer would 
  display the hallways location description....

  You are in the upstairs hallway. To the west is the bathroom and 
  some stairs lead down. To the south is your bedroom.

  We have now been moved to the hallway and told where we are and  
  what we see. We can get to any location in the game by telling 
  the computer to move there by typing the directions in.

  As we typed "go north" to go to the hallway we need to type "go  
  south" to get back to the bedroom. More details in chapter two.

          Other Descriptions  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
  The location description will always stay the same so we use other 
  descriptions which change and move about. These are objects and
  messages. First lets have a look at objects. This are things   
  that can be picked up and used by the player in the game. For
  example, a sword could be found at a location. If one is found   
  then the computer would say....

              You can see a sword.

              >_

  So if you want to take the sword you would just type "get sword" 
  and the computer will take it and say...

              Okay you have got the sword.

              >_

  By typing "i" and pressing return the computer will list the   
  objects you are carrying. The letter "i" stands for inventory.

  You can move from location to location by just typing the first  
  letter of the required direction, for example typing the letter
  "n" is the same as "go north", and "ne" is just the same as   
  typing "go north east"...etc...........

  Now you have the object you may want to see what it looks like,  
  so you could type "examine sword" and the computer could say...

              The sword is sharp with a golden hilt.

  If the object is a piece of clothing then you could wear it by   
  typing "wear coat" or "remove coat" to take it off.

  So if you wear the coat and then pressed "i" then the computer   
  would say something like..........

                  You have with you a coat (worn).

  If you are carrying a lamp and it has been lit then the
  inventory could say.... a lamp (lit).

  If you wanted to get rid of the object then you would just type  
  "drop object" and it would stay at the present location.

             More details on objects in chapter two

             Messages    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
          
  There are two types of message. Examine and Game. The Examine   
  messages print up when you examine an object as in the above
  example. So typing "examine key" could print the message..

               The key has some very small writing on it.

  Game messages are ones that print up at all other times like..

                There is a large dragon here.

                Inside the jug is a key.

  Game messages are also used when you examine part of the present 
  location. For example.......

  >examine fireplace

  A large fire burns proudly in it.

  Here are the normal commands used in adventures...

        Get- get an object from the present location.         
          Drop- drop an object at the present location.
        Examine- examine a carried object or part of location.
        i- lists objects that are carried or worn.
         Quit- ends the game.

  You can also group commands together like this......

  >drop lamp and get sword then examine it_

  Please note that any words or letters between two quotes "" are  
  to tell you what to type on the screen (user commands) so you
  see something like "get sword" then you type it on the screen   
  without the quotes! (ie: get sword).

  What is also important is that you must type any user commands   
  in lower case letters, not capitals else the game just won't
  understand it at all.

  So thats mainly what an adventure game is, a game that puts you  
  in a new world and leaves you to tell the computer what to do.
  In order to make things a little bit clearer there is a sample
  adventure game on this disk called ST BRIDES which was written   
  in one day using sac. In this game you play the part of a school
  girl who is trapped in St brides school and the object of the   
  game is to find the doorkey and get out. There are plenty of
  adventure games in the PD librarys to play which will enable you 
  to learn more about them. In fact I have put together a small
  compilation of the best ones on a disk, so if you would like a   
  copy then send me œ2 and I'll send it to you.
