From Tore Langeland Tangen, STOS Coders - Atari ST Facebook page (April 2018):

Ok, I know a lot of people coded games on STOS, but it did also contain tools for coding programs.

Attached is a purpose built "DPS" for a club I used to be a member of in my youth. It contains a simple line editor and hard coded driver for printing on Epson matrix printers.
