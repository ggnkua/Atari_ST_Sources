From Tore Langeland Tangen, STOS Coders - Atari ST Facebook page (April 2018):

Also, having gotten my hands on a formatting tool for STOS, I made a DOS "simulator". In addition to being capable of formatting floppies in several formats, it can also copy files between disks.

Unfortunately I didn't know how to code a line parse at that time, so each part of the command has to be separated by a return.
