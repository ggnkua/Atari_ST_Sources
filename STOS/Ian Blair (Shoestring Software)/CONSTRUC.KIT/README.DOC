THE STOS SHOOT EM UP BUILDER KIT   version 0.6     SHAREWARE
(c) SHOESTRING SOFTWARE 1990/1991        written by FLIPSIDE

               (needs STOS language disk to work)

This program may be freely distributed providing this text file 
is included on the disk. All programs produced with this utility 
are copyright free.

The main improvements over v0.5 are sampled sound effects for the 
explosions and better error handling. Also the program has been 
cured to a certain extent of the jerkyness in the previous 
version. 

Details on how to obtain the full version are included at the end 
of this text file.


                           INFORMATION

The utility is basically divided up into two parts:

1. THE GAME

This part contains the logic to control the players ship, up to 
six alien sprites and seven missiles which may be on screen at 
any one time.
all the parts are user definable simply by changing the files 
that are included on the disk. The music, backgrounds, sprites 
and the aliens attack paths can all easily be changed.

2. THE PATH DEFINER
Everything you need to modify the attack paths of up to six 
aliens in an attack wave that lasts up to 1000 steps


                        THE GAME PROGRAM

This program works by reading various files on the disk. These 
files are:

SPRITE folder -------------------------------------------------

SPRITE.MBK
This file is produced as normal by the sprite definer supplied 
with the STOS language disk. Any number of sprites can be used 
for the aliens but there are some sprites to be reserved. These 
are: 
1         PLAYERS SHIP
2         EXPLOSION  (FRAME ONE)
3         EXPLOSION  (FRAME TWO)
12        BLANK SPACE (to erase sprites from screen)


Sprites 4-31 are reserved for the background. 
All sprites should be kept to 16x16 for speed, and also the 
background creator is only set up for this size. The only 
exception is the players sprite that can be up to 32x20 with the 
hot spot in the centre.

HOT SPOTS these should be set in the centre of all the moving 
sprites and on the top right hand corner of all the background 
sprites.









SCREENS folder ------------------------------------------------

Three screens are included in this folder.

TITLE.NEO this is the screen that is displayed before the game is 
played

SCREEN.NEO is the play screen. The game area stretches from 
32 pixels to 240 across and goes all the way down the screen. The 
best idea is to use the included screen as a template. 
The palette for this screen should be the same as the sprite.mbk 
as all the colours are taken from there and it can lead to some 
strange effects.
 
FINAL.NEO is the final screen. You can place whatever message you 
like there.


All screens are stored in NEOCHROME format.

One  other  file  that is stored in the  SCREENS  folder  is  the 
background file produced with the MAP.ACB accesory stored on  the 
language disk. 

To produce the file BACKS.MBK run the MAP accessory and load your 
sprites  that you have defined.  Place the sprites in  columns  3 
through to 15 all the way down the screen.
Full  instructions  for this program are contained  in  the  STOS 
instruction manual.
When  saving the file the filename BACKS.MBK must be used or  the 
program will not accepth the file and an error will be generated.
Once  again  it will be best to begin by modifying  the  existing 
file.



MUSIC folder --------------------------------------------------

MUSIC.MBK is another file produced with the MUSIC.ACB program on 
the language disk.

Two pieces of music should be defined

1.  The introduction music

2.  The losing theme

Small repeating music pieces work better as it is impossible to 
predict the length of time that it plays.





SAMPLES folder ----------------------------------------------

SAMPLES.MBK

This folder is optional, if you have the STOS maestro program 
then define two samples.

1.  PLAYER EXPLOSION

2   ALIEN EXPLOSION

These are played automatically at the correct speed. Combine them 
both into the above file with the MAESTRO.ACB file on the MAESTRO 
disk.
If these files do not exist then the program will use the samples 
that have already been defined and incorporeted into the program.


MOVES folder ---------------------------------------------------

The  files  in  this folder are produced with  the  PATH  definer 
program supplied on this disk.

To  use the program a full description of each icon is  given  on 
the opening screen.

1.    Load  the sprites  with the SPRITES ICON in  the  top  left 
corner.

2.    A  background may be loaded by clicking on  the  BACKGROUND 
ICON. A left click for a NEOCHROME screen and a right click for a 
DEGAS PI1 screen.




3.    Select the sprite by using the arrows above and below  the 
sprite window.

4.     Choose which alien it is to be. Using the + - symbols next 
to the number display.

5.     Reset the counter underneath the play and record icons

6.     Click on the record icon.

7.      To place the spriite in position move the pointer to  the 
first  position on the playscreen and click on the mouse  button. 
To place the sprite off screen click on the void icon. Each click 
is one move in the game.

8.     Move the alien to the next position.


9.     Repeat step 8.

10.    To exit RECORD MODE simply press the right mouse button.

11.     Reset  counter  to start.   LEFT button moves  in  single 
steps. Right button moves in 20 steps.

12.     Select  stepped  or  continuous playback  mode  with  the 
appropriate icon.

13.     Enter playback mode by clicking on PLAY

14.      To  make changes simply stop,  reset the counter to  the 
chosen  position and enter record mode.  Stop when  changes  have 
been made.



15.     Repeat with aliens 2-6 

16.     When saving the file use the filename 1.mbk for level one
        2.mbk   for level two
        3.mbk   for level three

(note the PD version only supports two levels.  A full version is 
available  from the author which supports up to 20  levels.  Full 
details later in the text file)

Future  additions  to the definer include  preset  attack  files, 
Using files from the MAP definer,  and an updated x y co-ordinate 
system.
