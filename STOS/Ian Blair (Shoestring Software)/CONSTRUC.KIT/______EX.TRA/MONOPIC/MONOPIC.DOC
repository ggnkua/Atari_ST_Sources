The program is designed to convert full colour Degas, Neochrome
or compressed STOS pictures into seven shades of glorious Black and
White. 

First the nitty gritty details, the finished picture uses the first 
eight colours of the palette to provide the palette. So the other 
eight can be used as you see fit in the finished image.

To use load a picture from the main menu. (Dead easy!) then click on
the monochrome option in the main menu. The program will display the
picture for about a minute while it beavers away. When it is finished
a beep will sound and it will display the finished picture. A click of 
a mouse button will bring you back to the main menu.

From here you can invert the picture or save it in one of the three
picture formats.

A small word of warning the picture does not work to well with Greens,
its all to do with the way that it converts the image. Hopefully
version two will work a lot better. What can you expect from a program 
that was written on a wet Saturday afternoon to get away from my
girlfriends mother.

Thats it so if you want to send me large amounts of money in 
gratitude for writing such a wonderful program (even if I have never
found a use for it!) then post it all in unmarked used notes to

Whooops nearly forgot to mention that you can use this as a STOS
accessory program or a stand alone PRG from the desktop. If it 
wasn`t compiled it would run very very very very slowly!!!!!!!!!
