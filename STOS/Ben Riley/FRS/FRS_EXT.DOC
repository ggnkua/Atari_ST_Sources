Instructions for using
the Small but useful FRS extension ( v2 should be a lot better )

Written by Ben Riley '93

Please note that this is the interpreter extension only
( if anyone could supply the compiler source, I would be grateful )




First of all I must say that I have only tested this extension on one other
ST besides my own STE and it worked ok but it should work on all ST's
except ones that are fitted with accelerators ( since the border removal
routines need exact timing ) and everything works okay on the Falcon except
for the scanfrequency commands ( i.e Hertz50 hertz60 ) which do nothing and
of course the border removal commands. The rvalid function also kept
giving back a value saying that there was a reset program in memory when
I tested it on my Falcon but I think this is because of an address change
or something like that. By the way if anyone knows how to rid the bug on
the Falcon in STOS which makes a character appear every now and again
then please tell me how to stop it, as it gets in the way quite often
when writing a program.

At the moment I am working on a second version in my spare time which will
include more versatile screen copying commands, the current ones may not
be very versatile but they are faster that equivalent commands in other
extensions. This version is very interesting but it does have some commands
which other extensions don't such as the border removal, frequency and
memory commands. Anyway enough of this chat-chit here is a current commands
list:-

1.	Hertz 50 - change to normal scan frequency
2.	Hertz 60 - change to a higher frequency ( only on colour monitors )
3. 	Mouse inter off - turn mouse off completely
4.	Mouse inter on - turn the mouse interrupt back on
5.	Screen wipe 'addr' - Clear a screen very fast
6.	Block copy 'addr1','addr2' - copy a screen
7.	Bottom inter on - remove bottom border
8.	Bottom inter off - put it back
9.	No sound - stop all sounds
10.	Set syscount 'value' - set the system timer

Now for some functions ( i.e. They return a value back to STOS )

1.	t=syscounter - get timer value
2.	r=rvalid - check for a reset program
3.	m=meg - check for a megabyte of memory



I would be grateful also if someone could supply the source for the compiler
extensions so these commands can be compiled.



1.	Hertz 50 - this is the scan frequency of a normal TV set and
		   can be used to set the frequency back to 50 Hz after
		   a change to 60 Hz.

	example:-

	10 cls
	15 hertz 60
	20 centre "Press any key to go back to 50 Hz..."
	30 wait key
	40 hertz 50

2.	Hertz 60 - this is used to increase the scan frequency to a higher
		   rate so as to improve screen quality. This command can
		   only be used on colour monitors as these can handle
		   the higher frequency. Do not try on a TV set as this
		   could damage it.

	example:-

	10 cls
	20 hertz 50
	30 centre "Press any key to change scan frequency..."
	40 wait key
	50 hertz 60
	60 cls
	70 centre "Press any key to return to normal frequency..."
	80 wait key
	90 hertz 50

3. 	Mouse inter off - this command turns of the mouse completely since
			  the normal 'hide' command draws a hidden mouse
			  pointer and uses up valuable processor time.

4.	Mouse inter on - this just restores the mouse after
			 mouse inter off has been entered.

5.	Screen wipe 'addr' - this clears a screen at the address 'addr'
			     it is much faster than cls.

	example:-

	10 sc=start(10)
	20 screen wipe sc

	would clear the screen bank 10

	10 screen wipe physic

	would clear the physical screen

6.	Block copy 'addr1','addr2' - this copies the screen at the address
				     'addr1' to the address at 'addr2'.
				     This command is very fast, faster
				     than commands in other extensions.

	example:-

	10 repeat
	20 block copy physic,physic-160
	30 wait vbl
	40 until fire

	note: the addresses 'addr1' and 'addr2' must be actual, that is
	      they must be 'start(10)' not just '10'

7.	Bottom inter on - this command removes the bottom border of the
			  screen thus allowing for a bigger screen.

	example:-

	10 erase 10
	20 reserve as work 10,64000 : rem * 2 screens in length *
	30 copy physic,physic+32000 to start(10)
	40 copy physic,physic+32000 to start(10)+32000
	50 old1=leek($45e)
	60 old2=leek($44e) : rem * save old screen pointers *
	70 loke $45e,start(10)
	80 loke $44e,start(10)
	90 bottom inter on : rem * remove bottom border *
	100 wait key
	110 loke $45e,old1
	120 loke $44e,old2
	130 bottom inter off : rem * restore old interrupts *
	140 default

8.	Bottom inter off - this just puts the border back in after a
			   'bottom inter on'

9.      No sound - this just removes any sounds which haven't or won't
		   stop.

10.	Set syscount 'value' - this sets the system timer ( 200 Hz tick )
			       allows for better accuracy than the timer
			       command.

11.     t=syscounter - this gets the value of the system timer which is
		       returned in the variable 't'.

12.	r=rvalid - this checks to see if there is a reset program in
		   memory.

	example:-

	10 if rvalid then bell : print "Reset prog in memory"

13.	m=meg - this checks for a megabyte of memory

	example:-

	10 if meg then print "You've got a megabyte!"



Well that concludes the proceedings for today, I hope this small extension
is of use to you, its a bit late but I might as well do some greetz
