                          The Stos Pack
                         ---------------

     Welcome to the Stos Software Pack.  Over the years that I 
have been programming in Stos Basic, I've made hundreds of 
routines, demo's and things to do billions of useful, not so 
useful, and totally unuseful things.  The miniute I got my hard 
drive I had to put them all on it.  This meant sorting them out.  
Jim thought it would be a good idea to send them off to Public 
Domain or something so, here they be!

     Well, actually, it's shareware.  You send me cash (fiver 
will do nicely) for receiving this/these disk(s).  And just so 
you can't say you didn't know the address, it's:-


          32 Clifton Avenue,
           Hartlepool,
            Cleveland,
             England.
          TS26 9QN.

     This should be displayed when you boot the disks.  If it 
isn't, you've got a virus.  Get the ultimate virus killer or 
something if this is the case.

     Now, because there are absolutely millions of files on these 
disks, I simply cannot be bothered to write an explanation for 
each one.  But I tell you what, if you do want an explanation of 
how to use a certain routine, send one pound (per routine) to me 
with details of which routine you want info for.  Don't forget to 
pop your address on the letter or else I will be one pound better 
off and you won't have the routine info!  I promise that my 
explanations of the routines will be detailed.

     Also, if anyone out there is good at music, we are simply 
begging out for some of those 3 voice tunes.  So come on!  Send 
us some work!  If we use it, you will recieve 15% profit off 
whatever we sell.  Well, must pop.  Oh, but before I go, if you 
want a routine writing to do something that these routines do not 
cover, send me five pounds with a detailed description of the 
routine required.  If the requirement is impossible (like a 50hz 
Sound Tracker routine with 4096 colours on screen) the cheque 
will be sent back.  Please make all cheques payable to 
A.C.Porritt.  Ok, gotta go!  Keep Coding!
