This is just a small file to tell you of any changes etc. that 
have been made to these disks.  First of all, in the scroller at 
the start, the date should be 8/2/92, even though the date at the 
time of releasing this is now 20/4/92.  This is due to the fact 
that it sat in Big Jim's bedroom for months gathering dust.

     I have added a couple of new files bringing the total to an 
astomishing 59 files!!!

     I would just like to say a hi to Aaron Fothergill (Stos club 
blokey) for giving me some hints after the release of the first 
Routines Disk.  (these being put more game idea's on and make all 
of the files .BAS's so you don't need to type the extension in 
when loading!)  Well, as far as games go, try Balls (full game) 
on disk #2.  I was gonna put Alien Being on (another attempt at a 
game (25 hz horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up with over 20 
sprites on screen)  But Jim (and Mr. DFREE) said I could not.  
Phooee!  If you want it, write to me!!!! (Must enclose a disk and 
return postage though)  And I will return it straight away (ie I 
will NOT give it to Jim!!!)

     Right, well, I think that's it, must go.  Keep coding!

     P.S.  I've just bought Stos 3D and it's pretty niffty.  
Routines for that should be out later this year.  (After my 
G.C.S.E.'s!!!)  Also, I think I'll release my Mega Animation 
Sequence that was done with Stos 3D.  25hz, 11 seconds of full 
screen ducking and diving through buildings in a chopper.  Look 
out for that!!!   BYE!
