ACC_FILES!

     They're in the ACC_FILE folder (you don't say!) and they 
are:-

     Compact2.ACB

          This can only be used if you have the Stos Squasher 
(from Cartoon Capers)  It compacts the picture, as the compactor 
does, but when you go to save it, squashes it and then saves it.  
You should note the size of the screen when it is compacted (not 
squashed) and then use something like...

     reserve as work 10,x (size of compacted screen)

     copy start(5),start(5)+y (size of compacted and squashed 
screen) to 10 : unsquash 10,y : unpack 10,back : screen copy back 
to physic

     Neo_Iff.CMP

          This little wonder converts Neochrome pictures to IFF 
picutres for use on the Amiga, or Amiga IFF pictures (as saved 
through AMOS) into Neochrome pictures.  Remember that when saving 
the Amiga picture, it must be 320x200x16 and be saved through 
AMOS.
