                           ------------
Let me first say that I have had this program for a long time but 
have kept it to myself only because I didn't know that anyone else 
would want to run cyber files through Stos. That was until I read 
a cry for help in ST FORMAT November '93 in the Stos section from 
someone looking for a program of this nature.

You should have the following files along with this doc file:

     PLAYSEQ.DOC    This doc file
     PLAYSEQ.PRG    The machine code program to play the files
     PLAYSEQ.BAS    An example of how to use the program
     ANI_MUS1.BAS   Example of music + animation using musauto
     AN1_MUS2.BAS   Example of music + animation through $4d6
     BEE.SEQ        An example cyber animation file


                      ---------------------
                      HISTORY AND TECHNICAL
                      ---------------------
The original 68000 code was taken from an APP file that loaded and 
ran the sequence files from desktop after double clicking on them.
After many a long hour the code was re-arranged, taking bits out, 
adding bits to it until eventually it worked through Stos.  The 
PLAYSEQ.PRG file is about 66k long, but this includes two 32k screen 
buffers.  The actual code to play the files is only about 2k.
Any 68000 programmers out there will probably ask why I didn't 
use the BSS statement, well I did originally but the program 
didn't work when it was eventually compiled, even though it worked 
fine through the editor.

But enough of this idle waffle, and on with the show.


                           ------------
                           INSTRUCTIONS
                           ------------
I noticed that before using some machine code programs through 
Stos you have to pass lots of different parameters, which can 
make life a bit complicated.

So I have kept this program as simple as possible so if you have 
trouble using it then get a brain transplant.  Here goes.

All you need to do is pass the address of the file in memory to 
areg(6) and  whether  you  want the sequence to  loop  or  not  in 
Dreg(6) then call the program.  That's it.  Wasn't too hard for
you was it ?  

Let's face it here, if you can't do that then why bother even to 
turn your machine on?

                       MUSIC AND ANIMATION
                       -------------------
A word of warning if you're thinking about playing chip music and 
animation at the the same time.  If the music uses interrupt 
address $4D2 then forget it because so does the program.  To solve 
this problem you could either get The Missing Link extension and 
use the musauto command or if you just want to play Mad Max or 
Count Zero then just use interrupt address $4D6 instead.

                            ST FORMAT
                           ------------
     I  sent  this program to St Format in November  93  and  they 
didn't even reply even to say that it was no good,  but judge  for 
yourselves.  Probably just kept it for themselves!  I shall never 
know.  What's the point of sending stuff in if they don't bother 
replying?  I ask you.

I anyone has anymore ideas or suggestions for moer program to run 
through Stos then don't hesitate to drop me a line - unless you're 
from ST FLOORMAT.
                         
                              ENJOY.
