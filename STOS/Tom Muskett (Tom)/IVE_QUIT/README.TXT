        a 96k intro in STOS Basic, enhanced with a sprinkling of ASM          

   Requirements:      ST/e with 1 Meg
                      (just fyi: this is really close to running in 512kb.
                       but given that 1 Meg is allowed, I couldn't face
                       fixing it. This has taken me *days* as it is :D)

                      You need to run this from the GEM desktop... (lolz)

   Fun fact:          The scrolltext tells a pretty long story. You can
                      either let the demo run, or skip out of the main
                      screen with a tap of the spacebar if you're bored.

   Backstory:         In September 2018, I put a couple of very rough STOS
                      screens on Atari Forum. They were just to illustrate
                      a couple of ASM-enhanced STOS demo-effects.
                      However, in doing this, it turned out that I was
                      accidentally releasing them. Scene dudes reacted and
                      they even ended up on the dhs youtube channel :D
                      I was embarrassed as hell. These weren't official!
                      So I decided to make a more design-driven STOS intro.
                      I also wanted to have some fun with some funny (and
                      true...) comments that Tomchi made on the screens
                      on the forum :D.

                      I'm done with STOS for demos now (there's nowhere
                      left to go with it, and all effects you see in this
                      demo rely on ASM to one extent or another). Hence
                      this demo's concept...
                      I would like to make some ASM releases in the future.
                      So I guess I will ;).
