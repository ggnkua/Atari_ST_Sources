SPECSHOW - STOS Spectrum 512 screen displayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        If you buy ST Format regulary,  you should have the issue with
Spectrum 512 on the  front  cover.   Aswell  as  the actual package, a
little program  was  given  away  that  allowed  you  to  display your
spectrum 512 creations from within  STOS.   All very nice, but nothing
else could be done unless your first  pressed a key.  If you have read
the doc accompanying the little file  they want something like œ15 off
you before you get a decent version on the program.  Well, never fear,
Neil of TYG to the rescue.......     Presenting  SPECSHOW the ultimate
spectrum 512 picture displayer for STOS basic.

What does it do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        What the program does is actually  display the picture to your
chosen screen, and then installs a  little routine that keeps updating
the color table.  The program only  needs  to be called twice, once to
turn it on, and once  to  turn  it  off.   The  only thing is that the
routine  takes  nearly  all  of  the  computers  processor  time,  not
surprising, coz when you run the thing  you do get 512 real colours on
screen, or 4096 if you own an ste!!!

        The program has been tested  for  it's interuptness (is this a
word??), and we managed to get the following things working with it..


        loading and saving files.

        common music types (without sampled bass line).

        about 4 single plane sprites.

        STE samples (not supprising really!).


Using the routine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        The main thing to remember is how to call the routine, and you
do it like this...

        dreg(0)=source : dreg(1)=dest : dreg(2)=mode : call bnk


Explained
~~~~~~~~~

        source : the address in memory where the picture file is held
                 eg.  start(10)

        dest   : the address where the decoded picture is to be
                 displayed  eg. physic

        mode   : must equal 1 to turn the routine on or 0 to turn the
                 routine off

        bnk    : the address in memory where the SPECSHOW program is
                 held  eg. start(14)

Hope you like this program, I hope you do, even though it only to me 5
