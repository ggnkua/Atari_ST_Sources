                  Extra source code folder info
                 -------------------------------

As an added extra we decided to give you the assembly language 
source code to the various sampling routines. These can be found 
in the SOURCE.S file.

It now makes the OBJ code rather rudundent, but this is still of 
use to people with other computer languages such as PASCAL or C.
