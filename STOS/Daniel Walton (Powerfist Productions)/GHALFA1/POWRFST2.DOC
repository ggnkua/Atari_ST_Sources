
  Some more rambling but hey you  don't  mind do you?Do please send in
things I could put  in  this  space.I  hope  you  like GHALFA 1.If you
haven't got SEVEN GALAXIES yet then get it because a lot of people say
that it's there favourite game from us yet.
   Deluxe Nostram (both versions)  are  going  to  be exellent.Did you
know   that   Shakespeare   invented   the   word   Exellent.All   you
programmers,musicians,graphic artists and any one  who writes games in
3D construction kit please contact me.And  I  would really like to see
some text/graphic adventures released into POWERFIST LICENCEWARE.
    I'll give you the address at the end of this.
  I usually do all my typing  on  either my computer back in Burncross
in Sheffield or at a mates  house  in  Burncross.But at the moment the
other persons in Hospital (Chris) with a  broken  leg and I'm nt in my
home town.I'm currently in Durham at Ian Wilkinsons house.He's the one
who makes all our games  look  so  Exellent.I've  been up here for the
last two days and we've both been  working very hard on GHALFA ONE and
some of the other games.
   It's a Sunday morning and I have  no idea what time it is.Its about
11 o'clock I think.I know  I  got  up  at  about  8 o'clock to do some
work.So there you are,we don't have any time off.I think Ians still in
bed as I write,but I've got my Walkman on and can't here a thing exept
the radio.It's Metro FM that  I'm  listening  to and being a Sheffield
lad I've never heard before.
    I'm  a  bit  shocked  that  the  DJ's  don't  speak  with  Geardie
accents.They should do really.The  room  i'm  in  is  a  bit of a mess
because I've been sleeping in  here  and  there  clothes and disks and
pieces of paper and  folders  all  over.Theres  also  an Amiga next to
me,but it gives me something to put my Coffee on.
    I own a  1  meg  STFM  (which  I  bought  in  1987  - TOS 1.0).I'm
currently working on a 1040 STe  which  is a very smart machine.So far
as fashionable keyboards go you could wear  a ST round your kneck it's
so exellent (did I tell you...) in appearance.
     My brother and some other people  have  joined up on the Amiga to
write games - under the name  Cult  Software(I think) so if your silly
enough to own an  Amoeba  then  have  a  look  at  their stuff when it
appears.
    No magazine  as  asked  me  for  an  interview  yet.I  would  be a
dangerous person to interview because there are  a lot of people who I
hate in the ST  world.Namely  all  the  Money  grabbers who don't care
about saving the last real home computer - THE ST.
   There'll never be any thing else like it so it's worth fighting for
and we'll be here to make sure your never without new games.
    I'll just say - Buy POWER (a new disk magazine - NOT by us).
   If   you   want   a   copy    write    to   :   POWER,3   SALISBURY
ROAD,MAIDSTONE,KENT,ME14 2TY.They'll  take  it  from  there.They do,do
free advertising so it might be worth contacting them.

      OUR ADDRESS IS (as always):-
