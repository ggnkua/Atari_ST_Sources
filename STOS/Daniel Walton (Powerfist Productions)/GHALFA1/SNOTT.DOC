    'SNOTT' - THE STORY

 The year? now!

 A galaxy a million miles from home,a universe not unlike ours.

 A civilisation perfect in every way.

 A culture that has seen no  famine,or wars,for countless thousands of
years.

 But then? peace was disturbed.

 THE 'ORBS' LANDED.

   and their mission is not a peaceful one.

 Their mission...................total destruction of your planet.

 The  creatures   which   inhabit   your   planet   are   dosed   with
radiation,their slightest touch would mean death...

 The scientist's worked twenty four hours of the day,to create you.
 But time was limited.When you  are  in  flight you are vunerable.When
you are on the planet surface you are protected for a short time!

cruiser lie across the land and within the fuel you need to escape You
must race through the ship  to  the  fuel  stores  at the heart of the

   Its centuries since you were closed down.You are the cleaning robot
of a long abandoned ship  floating  through  space without a crew.When
you are awakened to clean  up  the  ship  you  soon relise its not the
centuries of dirt that will be the  the problem but the resident alien
within each level and the hordes they have brought with them.
      A quick bit of laser practise though  and off in a overhead romp
around blasting the crap  out  of  everything  that  moves.This is the
biggest game to date written  by  Powerfist  and  the puzzles to solve

to that of Nostram this is unmissable.

without guns.But with your armoured tank  you dispatch of them through
your gun or through  your  tracks.A  combination  of  chaos engine and
