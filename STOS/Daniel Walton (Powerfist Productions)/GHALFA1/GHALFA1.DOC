      GHALFA ONE
      ----------

  The panel started to flicker.The fuel was nearly down and you didn't
fancy the chances of getting  much  further.Below lie a planet,covered
in golden sand and  without  a  moon  in  sight  you guided your craft
through the atmosphere.
   A far cry away from two days  ago  when  you stood upon the hill in
Juno carrying the flag of victory.You had fought for two years and now
you should be heading home,instead you  were landing on a planet you'd
never seen before.
   The report said No  alien  life  but  your  lazer  remained by your
side.The door slid open and the  swirling  winds carried dust into the
craft.In the distance you could see a ship half burried in the dunes.
  You ventured forward towards the  ship.A  crack in its side revealed
an entrance.A sign on its side revealed a name - "GHALFA ONE".
   There had to be fuel inside.

   Playing
   -------

 The aim of  the  game  is  to  complete  the  four  levels.Each level
contains different scenery and creatures.Pushing  up sends you up into
the air and then you fall back down.If  you push right and up then you
jump to the right and  if  you  push  just  up  then you jump into the
air(falling slower - because of your jetpac).
  Left and right control the walking of your man and pushing down will
pump a lazer from the gun.Monsters can  be shot or dodged but the last
monster on each level (apart from level one) does have to be killed to
progress.Enjoy and I hope for your sake there is fuel.


There is no end of level guardian on the first level.
The end of level guardians on êthe êsecond êand last level can be just äshot.
The end of level guardian on the êthird level can be killed by hitting ähis missiles.
