STOSPIC by Martin Cubitt, 31st July 1993
 
This small STOS accessory allows basic
manipulation between picture formats.

It lets you load the following formats:

 NEO, PI1, TN1, PC1, MBK

and lets you save NEO or PI1.

 
Some of the code may be of use in your
own programs but please mention me if
you do use any code. Note that the
routine to unpack Degas Elite (PC1)
images was from the STOS Newsletter,
all other code by me!



I expect (if necessary) to expand the
program to allow picture de-shading,
blurring and various other techniques.


If you like this little accessory let
me know! Don't worry - its totally FREE!
