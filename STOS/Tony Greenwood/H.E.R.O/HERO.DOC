                            SCENARIO

EYES ONLY           Ex Thorp Transcript 28/PF/99           EYES ONLY
                 Message recieved 3:21.14 22nd June

Notification Status: 2               Immediate Action Required: None

=====================================================================

From    : Ex-Thorp Bio-Nuclear Complex
To      : Central Office, Downing Street

Location: Ex-Thorp in scottish central region, "Bodach Howf"
Purpose : Artificial Intelligence research at genetic level.
          Inter connecting silcon chips and biological matter,
          creating living, 'thinking' computer systems.

Comment : The complex is working on delicate interdependant systems
          performing revolutionary tasks...perhaps too delicate..

     Time frame breakdown of current emergency 2.15pm 22nd June
=====================================================================

2:00.00 Operator in area 2 spills unauthorised coffee onto a control
        panel and short circuits the panel.
2:00.15 All safety trips and failsafes - fail -
        coffee the unthought of variable.
2:00.17 Operator in area 2 hits the isolate control to limit the
        damage.
2:00.20 Damage limitation ineffective. Massive currents surge through
        Ex-Thorps cable network.
2:00.21 Finally reaching central control computer Z352-P-AI.
        The first bio-silicon "super computer" (a.k.a "The Beast")
2:00.25 Major system 'warping', program slippages and neural blocks
        registered.
2:00.28 Z352-P-AI conducts a bio scan of the complex.
2:00.33 Scans indicate that human personnel are escaped lab animals.
2:00.34 "The Beast" activates emergency procedure level 1.
2:00.35 Laser doors activated.
2:00.36 Radiation pools exposed.
2:00.50 Personnel panic and run to the exits.
2:01.17 Z352-P-AI senses escapees and triggers emergency
        procedure level 2.
2:01.18 All external and inter-level doors are sealed.
2:01.19 All mechanoids are externally charged creating hazards to
        life forms.
2:01.20 Ventilators are opened through out complex allowing
        radioactive isotopes from the radiation pools to flow freely.
2:01.40 Central Control realise there is an emergency and try to
        isolate Z352-P-AI from the complex - all attempts fail.
2.05.22 Frightened personnel protect themselves as they can - hiding
        in ventilator free rooms or - if found - putting on anti-
        radiation suits.
2:10.21 A program 'backdoor' is found and some control is removed
        from  Z352-P-AI
2:12.17 Z352-P-AI moves to crimson status and seals the complex
        from the world.
        Simultaneosly activating the destruct sequence.
2.14.36 Personnel count reveals that only 3 people remain in a mobile
        condition. - Roger McCormick (Complex supervisor), Jane
        Beltane (System Analyst) and Jim Masters (Clerk).

2.20.00 Meeting of the 3 remaining personnel define current status:

  1)    The complex is irradiated and has become incompatible
        for life, outside of specific sealed areas.
  2)    The complex is now under destruct sequence which will totally
        destroy the complex within 12 hours.
  3)    There are trapped personnel.
  4)    All external doors and inter-level doors have been sealed
        thus disallowing any access to the levels.

2.50.14 Remedies are put forward to correct current emergency:

  1)    The recently installed, prototype teleport system must be
        brought on line. While the system is problematic, it has
        access to all internal and external areas and can safely
        transport humans providing they have a gentic code teleport
        card, required for it's operation.
  2)    The trapped personnel must be rescued. This can only be
        achieved by releasing them from the rooms they have
        sealed themselves in and retrieving their teleport card.
        Further they must be provided with an anti radiation suit
        which, while it will protect them for an indefinite period,
        it will render them immobile. Their teleport card must be
        given to the transmitting teleport located on each level.
  3)    In order to deactivate the destruct sequence 3 chips must be
        located and inserted into the sub level computer. This will
        deactivate one section of the complex. However in order to
        completely deactivate the destruct sequence all sub level
        computers must be isolated.

3:05.16 Some problems are raised in reference to the remedies are:

  1)    The external location of personnel, teleports etc. is
        impossible due to isolation procedures and system
        malfunctions. Therefore any rescuer is 'running blind' within
        the complex.
  2)    Only some of the system control has been returned to central
        control, so maintainance mechanoids will still damage any
        human who comes into contact with them, but at least they
        will not attack. And the lasers can only be  brought under
        partial control, thus making them flicker randomly. Some
        internal doors could not be remotely unlocked, while others
        in a separate circuit require access cards. The radiation
        pools, and ventilator system could not be brought under any
        control. Total control of the internal lifts were retained.
  3)    As anti radiation suits render the wearer immobile this form
        of protection is non viable. The alternative method of
        ingesting large quantities of iodine and other radiation
        sponges, leave the user open to vulnerability, even slight
        knocks can have fatal consequences. With the current status
        of the mechanoids this would make the rescuers attempts
        diffcult in the extreme. No other alternatives are available
        so this is the only viable method.
  4)    Z352-P-AI retains total control of internal closed loop doors
        thus requiring the doors to be destroyed if passage is
        required.
  5)    Of the 3 personnel available to achieve these tasks only one
        has a genetic code card enabling them to use the teleports -
        Jim Masters.
  6)    As Jim is only a clerk he is the least knowledgable about the
        complexs computer systems so local disabling of computers is
        not possible.
  7)    Due to teleport 'problems' no volatile product can be
        transported in this manner so standard gunpowder and shell
        defences are not viable. The only alternative is a hand held
        electro-static 'stun' gun which will either destroy
        mechanoids, cause them to alter their movements or do
        nothing, depending on the mechanoids mechanical and
        electronic components.
  8)    In addition to defence weapons no explosives can be
        transported to remove closed loop doors. However it was
        pointed out that small amounts of explosives are routinely
        stored in the complex for experimental purposes.

3:15.43 Jim Masters aggrees to make the rescue attempt and is
        currently preparing himself for the task.

Final   : We have little choice but let Jim try and make this rescue.
          I hope he succeeds. God help us I hope he succeeds.

JOYSTICK CONTROL:

Jim  will  perform  various  moves  when  the  joystick  is  used, 
depending on his position.

 UP (1) jim will jump into thin air
    (2) jim will climb a wall
    (3) jim will jump up onto a ledge ( if one there )
    (4) jim will move lift up ****, lift  controls, 
more  automatic now but you still have control as the lift will stop  when 
you  move  the  joystick  in any direction other than  that  of  the  lift 
traveling direction,
    (5) jim will stand ( if knelt shooting or crawling )
    (6) look in cabinet, look at various objects

 ARROWS if touched then you die , shooting will change there direction

 GREEN SLIME ( drips or on barrels or on floor ) touch it and you die

 BARRELS WITH POISON SIGN touch them and you die,

 LAZERS touch and you die **** these where totally random,  but this 
made the game far too hard, they are still random but when they go off, it 
will be for a minimum of two seconds, phew!

 APPEARING FING,  cant be killed,  will kill you if touched but only  when 
its fully appears

 CEILING DROID, cant be killed, will kill you if you touch it, yuk!

                ******* HOW TO COMPLETE A LEVEL *******
 

 FIND SUIT, FIND TELEPORT CARD, FIND COMPUTER CHIP, FIND MAN AND AUTO GIVE 

 HIM  SUIT,  FIND TELEPORT OUT ( not the same as in,  this one has  numbers 

 near it ) USE TELEPORT CARD ( same way as use access card ) THEN CLIMB  IN 

 TELEPORT AND AWAY YOU GO,

                             And Finally..........

    This game has now been released as a "Freeware" program, you may know  
that H.E.R.O.  was originaly a commercial release, but unfortunatly due to 
the unscrupious dealings of the distributers we where to coin a phrase "we 
were robbed!",  not having the facilities to distribute the game ourselves 
the decision was taken to release H.E.R.O.  to the general public as a cut 
down version and free of charge,
    "Cut down" means there is no intro program as it was deemed to take up 
too  much space as the free program was to be released on one  disk,  this 
also goes for the end program,  both these have been substituted for  more 
econimicaly sound routines,

     The  decision  to re-release H.E.R.O.  was taken  by  myself  (  Tony 
Greenwood  )  and my co-producer Bob Goodfellow,  unfortunatly  before  we 
could   decide on how to release it,  Bob dissapeared and to this  date  I 
have  heard nothing from Bob for four months+,  therefore as Bob seems  to 
have dissapeared and flatly refuses to aknowledge any contacts  whatsoever 
I  have taken it upon myself to dust off the game and at last actualy  let 
people see it, I hope you like it and I hope you dont mind Bob, but it was 
gathering dust mate!,

    If anyone wants to contact me on either adress
