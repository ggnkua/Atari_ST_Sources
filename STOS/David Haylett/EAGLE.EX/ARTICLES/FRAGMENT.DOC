                            REDUCING ACCESS TIME
                           ----------------------

Once you get a disk (usually a work disk for either a word processor,
language, art program etc.) which has files added and deleted regularly, you
may notice that it gradually takes longer for the program to load in any one
file. This is due to fragmentation. This means that each file is not stored
in one consecutive part of the disk, but instead it eventually gets split up
and thrown about all over the disk, because various sectors are left blank
when a file is erased and various sectors are full of data when a new file is
stored. eg:

A blank disk: ..........................................................
              ..........................................................

(each dot represents a track - there are two sides to the disk)

Save one small file to it and it looks like this (3 tracks long):

              ***.......................................................
              ..........................................................

Save another file which is 4 tracks in length:

              ***++++...................................................
              ..........................................................

Save yet another file which is 14 tracks in size:

              ***++++##############.....................................
              ..........................................................

Now, delete the second file because we do not need it any more:

              ***....##############.....................................
              ..........................................................

Those four tracks are now free.

Now, save a big new file which is 20 tracks in size:

              ***~~~~##############~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.....................
              ..........................................................

The new file has been fragmented (split up) to fill the empty spaces.

Now, delete the first file:

              ...~~~~##############~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.....................
              ..........................................................

Save a new file (8 tracks in length):

              000~~~~##############~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~00000................
              ..........................................................

As you can see, files begin to get fragmented, and access time increases
because the drive has to move about all over the disk, instead of just
reading one fixed set of bytes. Eventually, the disk could look like this:

              000~~~~99..9999777~77~~~~~~~~7~~~~~~~00000777777jjjjkjjjjj
              jjjjjjj.j...k....kkookkooooooo.oookkooooo.......o...99....

The solution to this problem is relatively simple. All you need to do is copy
the disk (FILE BY FILE) to another disk (an 800K RAM disk is best), FORMAT
the original disk, then copy each file back to that disk. Seeing as the whole
disk is now empty, each file is stored one after the other, leading to zero
fragmentation. The above disk would now look something like this:

              00000000~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~99999999777777777777jjjjjjjjjj
              jjjjjjjkkkkkkkoooooooooooooooooo..........................


ALWAYS REMEMBER TO BACK-UP THE ORIGINAL DISK BEFORE DOING THIS!
