                        GENERAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                       -------------------------------

Here, I will try to pose as many problems as possible and answer them as
straightforwardly as possible. Here we go:


MFPs
----

Qu) No matter how much I try, I just can't seem to get the MFP routines to
    work. After setting up the data and typing MFP ON x, nothing happens.

Ans) i) Ensure you have entered x=EAGLE MFPS ON at the start of the program.
     ii) Have you specified the same number with the MFP ON command as the
         first number of the INIT MFP command?



Qu) When I try to use INIT MFP, I get an MFP ERROR with some text telling me
    what to do.

Ans) You cannot initialise a new MFP if: i) the x=EAGLE MFPS ON function has
     not been entered yet, or ii) if the MFP number you have stated as the
     first parameter is already active, in which case either use a different
     MFP number, or use MFP OFF x to disable that one.


Qu) When I start off an MFP with MFP ON, the computer either crashes, locks
    up, or gives me a BUS ERROR, ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION, etc. What's wrong?

Ans) i) Have you actually used INIT MFP to set up the MFP?
     ii) Make sure you are specifying the correct address for the start of
         the parameter list as the last value in INIT MFP.
     iii) Make sure you do not have too many MFPs running at once. If you
          have more than 50Hz-worth, then the system will lock up. The best
          way to see how much processor time you are using up, is to make use
          of MFP number 99 (see manual). The lower down the screen the lines
          are, the less time you have left!
     iv) All MFPs are dangerous to use, to a greater or lesser extent. They
         are executed regularly, using up a certain amount of processor time,
         and can generally tend to mess everything up. If you are still
         having problems, try each MFP one at a time, to see where the
         problem lies, and work from there.


Qu) When entering ? EAGLE MFPS ON or ? EAGLE MFPS OFF, I keep getting the
    value 0. What does this mean?

Ans) Absolutely nothing. The above two commands were supposed to be just
     EAGLE MFPS ON and EAGLE MFPS OFF, but with the strict limits imposed
     by STOS extensions, I almost ran out of instruction slots. The 0's do
     not mean anything at all, and if they are annoying when enabling or
     disabling the EAGLE MFP handler, type something like M=EAGLE MFPS ON or
     ZZZ=EAGLE MFPS OFF. A value is not printed, but the routines are still
     called (the same applies to x=WHAT IS, x=EAGLE, and any other commands
     which seem to return a pointless value).


Qu) After using the CONNECT command, nothing seems to happen.

Ans) The CONNECT command actually copies several longwords of data from one
     area of memory to another, thus it is invisible. There should be a
     seperate tutorial which is all about the CONNECT command and what it
     does.



GENERAL
-------


Qu) After including an EAGLE function as part of a parameter list, for
    example: colour 0,redy(1)   init mfp 1,1,area   ?hrdpal(active)
    the computer locks up. Why?

Ans) For some reason, beyond my control I'm afraid, STOS does not allow
     certain functions to be included as parameters in one go. To accomplish
     the examples stated above, you must first put the parameter into a
     variable, and use the variable in the command, for example:
     x=redy(1) : colour 0,x
     a=area : init mfp 1,1,a
     ac=active : ?hrdpal(ac)


Qu) When I specify a memory bank screen as a parameter for some commands,
    I get a BUS ERROR, or the command doesn't work.

Ans) With most of the EAGLE commands (as with most other extensions), you
     must use the START() function. If you want to specify memory bank 7 as
     the source or destination address of a screen, you need to enter
     START(7) and not just 7. '7' on it's own actually refers to memory
     address 7, not the start of bank 7.


Qu) When using such commands as VERT and BYTE TEXT, the computer doesn't
    use the strings that I specify. Why?

Ans) Have you used VARPTR()? When telling the EAGLE extension to use a
     string, for example INIT TEXT m$,8 or INIT VERT t$,physic,0,0,20
     you must specify the ADDRESS of the string, and not the string itself.
     The above two examples would therefore be INIT TEXT varptr(m$),8 and
     INIT VERT varptr(t$),physic,0,0,20


Qu) I keep getting annoying messages every now and then which clutter up my
    display, overwrite program code, and make me want to smash my telly.

Ans) Register! If you get messages, you only have version 0.8 of the EAGLE
     Extension. The only other solution is to erase the EAGLE filenames from
     your STOS disk and go without! See the end of the manual for details.


Qu) After using the "ANIMATE MOUSE" MFP to make the pointer more interesting,
    whenever I load in a new program, erase bank 1, it seems to stop working
    proporly.

Ans) This MFP uses the current sprite bank for the images you want. If this
     sprite bank is lost (after loading a new program, erasing the bank, or
     whatever) then the images will not exist, and therefore the pointer will
     look strange. Remedy: either keep the bank or don't animate at all.


Qu) How can I make the VERT texts or MESSAGE texts different colours instead
    of colour 1 all the time?

Ans) You will have to use plane-shifting. To get colour 2, you will have to
     add '2' to the destination address (eg. physic+2). To get colour 4, you
     add '4', and to get colour 8 you add '6'. If you want to get colour 15,
     then I'm afraid you will have to overlay more than one copy of the same
     text, but with a slightly different plane offset. This is not possible
     with VERT (although you can overlay more than one MFP vert-scroll), but
     you can do it fairly easily with MESSAGE. Example:

     To get the message "HELLO" in colour one, do this (assuming your font is
     loaded into memory bank 5):

     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic

     To get it in colour 2, do this:

     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic+2

     To get it in colour 5, do this:

     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic
     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic+4

     And in colour 15:

     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic
     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic+2
     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic+4
     MESSAGE "HELLO",start(5),0,0,physic+6


Qu) After loading some data into the AREA, strange things begin to happen.

Ans) The AREA is only one kilobyte long. Any files or data which you attempt
     to place in there which are longer than one kilobyte will begin to
     over-write important extension data. Solution: use a memory bank or
     string.
