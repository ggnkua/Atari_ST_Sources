By Asa Burrows

The New STOS STE Commands :


x = STE

This function returns 1 if the machine is an STE or 0 if it isn't. You
can test to see if it's an STE or not and adjust your game to suit,
giving STE owners the extra features but still making the program
compatible with all STs.


Joysticks

Your STE now has the ability to use up to six of the little wagglers.

x= LSTICK (j)
Returns the current status of the joystick's left
position. The value x holds either -1 if the joystick is in the left
position or zero if it isn't. You can access up to six joysticks, j
holds the number of the stick you want, one to six.

The following functions work exactly the same way for the other
directions and the <fire> button.

x= RSTICK (j) right
x= USTICK (j) up
x= DSTICK (j) down
x= FSTICK (j) fire

To access joysticks one & two you need to use these other
commands.

STICKS ON
This command activates the interrupt routine for twin joysticks
control on the ST and STE, it also disables the mouse.

STICKS OFF
This de-activates the interrupt routine and reactivates the
mouse.

The new extension is completely compatible with the twin sticks
extension, so if you have that you can use the same commands without
any bother. They have been included in the STE extension to maintain
compatibility.

x =STICK1 and x =STICK2

Returns the status of joysticks 1 and 2 respectively. The variable
holds one byte laid out as follows. This is a bit of a bind and it's
better to stick with the easier joystick commands.

       Bit     description

       0       UP      if bit set
       1       DOWN    if bit set
       2       LEFT    if bit set
       3       RIGHT   if bit set
       4       UNUSED
       5       UNUSED
       6       UNUSED
       7       FIRE    if bit set

Light Gun/Pen

If you've a light gun or pen you can now write a shoot-'em-up for it.

x =LIGHT X and y =LIGHT Y

These two commands return the x and y co-ordinates of your gun or pen
when the <fire> button is pressed and holds it until it's pressed
again. You can check the button using the FSTICK (3) command because
the To check the <fire> button use the FSTICK (3) command, the button
is returned as joystick three.


Extended colour palette

The STE has a palette of 4096 colours rather than an ST's 512.

E PALETTE $RGB,$RGB,...(up to 16 colour values)

This command works exactly as the PALETTE command in STOS,
except that it uses a hex number for the colour values. Hex uses base
sixteen rather than the decimal base 10. Letters are used for values
over nine. Ten is represented by 'a', eleven by 'b' and so on. White
now becomes $fff.

E COLOUR colour,$RGB

The same as the COLOUR command but using hex values and access to the
4096 colours.

x= E COLOR (colour)

No it isn't a spelling mistake, it's just a limitation of
STOS. You can't use the same name for a command and function.
This command returns the RGB value of the colour number, 0 to 15.


STE DAC and Microwire Interface

The DAC is one of the best things added to the ST. This brilliant
Digital to Analogue Converter plays raw sample sound in stereo, and
with the Microwire Interface you can set left and right volume control
as well as treble and bass.

DAC CONVERT start address of sample, end address of sample

Because the STE DAC plays raw sampled sound you'll need to
convert your Maestro samples. DAC CONVERT does the job almost
instantly. Ideal for using the same sample data for the ST and STE.

DAC SPEED

Sets the speed of sample replay. 0=6Khz, 1=12.5Khz, 2=25Khz and 4 is a
pretty amazing 50Khz.

DAC RAW start address of sample,end address of sample

Plays your raw sample.

DAC MONO and DAC STEREO

Guess what, sets the sample to be mono or stereo.

DAC LOOP ON and DAC LOOP OFF

Want an endless wall of noise? Set the loop function on and off with
these commands.

DAC M VOLUME volume
DAC L VOLUME volume
DAC R VOLUME volume
DAC TREBLE volume
DAC BASS volume

These commands set the master, left and right volume as well as the
treble and bass. The volume can be anywhere from 0 to 12.

DAC MIX ON and DAC MIX OFF

These commands allow you to mix the PSG sound chip with the
STEs DAC.

DAC STOP

Tricky one this, it er, stops the DAC.


Hardware Scrolling

The STE has hardware scrolling which enables screen data to be shifted
in bytes rather than words using the hardware. All this adds up to
single pixel scrolling.

HARD SCREEN SIZE w,h,mode

Sets the screens logical size. w=width of screen and h=height of
screen ready for scrolling.

HARD SCREEN OFFSET x,y

This command tells the ST where to start displaying the screen.

x = HARD PHYSIC (screen address)

This command tells the ST where the screen is stored.

HARD INTER ON and HARD INTER OFF

Once you have set all the hardware scrolling commands you can turn on
the scrolling with these two. While the interrupt routine is running
you use the HARD SCREEN OFFSET to get scrolling effect. If an error
occurs while interrupt is on STOS turns hardware scrolling off.
