STOS Tracker
------------

1. Installation.

   To use STOS-Tracker, copy one of the TRACK???.EXS files into your STOS
   Basic folder, and the corresponding TRACK???.ECS file into your
   COMPILER folder.

   Each extension has a different playback frequency:

   * 7Khz - The samples are not of high quality but a lot of time is left
            for the processor.  This should be used for animation
            sequences etc.

   * 14Khz - The samples are now of excellent quality, but practically all
             of the processor time is used up, making animation sequences
             counter-productive.  This should be used for static titles.

   * 10Khz - This is a good compromise between the above two!


2. New STOS Basic instructions

   2.1. TRACK LOAD "filename.abk",b

   This command loads the file "filename.abk" into the memory bank "b".
   The file must be an AMOS memory bank or a converted sound tracker
   module.  The memory bank need not have been previously reserved.

   TRACK LOAD erases a previously loaded bank.


   2.2. TRACK PLAY n

   This command starts to play music number N in the track bank.
   Pressing UNDO stops the music (see security key!)


   2.3. TRACK STOP

   Stops any music currently being played.


   2.4. TRACK BANK b

   It is possible to have more than one bank in memory, TRACK BANK changes
   the current bank to the new bank number "b".


   2.5. TRACK TEMPO t

   Like AMOS, this alters the tempo of the track being played.  The value
   can range between 1(slow) and 100(fast), but some instruments cannot
   cope with fast speeds.  50 is a suitable alternative, but
   experimentation is advised.


   2.6. TRACK VOLUME v

   Like AMOS, this command alters the volume of the track begin played to
   that of "v".  v can range from 0 to 63.


   2.7. TRACK KEY k

   As STOS Tracker halts all the keyboard inputs, a small security routine
   has been placed in the machine code program: The routine test for one
   key, and stops the interrupts if that key is pressed, giving control
   back to the user.

   k is the SCANCODE of the security key.  Default is UNDO, choose -1 for
   no security.


   2.8. =TRACK SCAN

   This returns the scancode of the last key pressed when a piece of music
   is being played.  This value is reset after it has been tested for.


   2.9. =TRACK VU(v)

   This is like the AMOS =VU function. V ranges from 1 to 4.  To
   understand more about this function, see the demonstration program
   supplied.

   IMPORTANT: you must not ERASE, RESERVE or LOAD a memory bank while
   music is being played. (Since it will crash your computer!)


3. Included on the disk.

Tracker format.  These converted files can be played from AMOS Basic or
STOS Basic.
