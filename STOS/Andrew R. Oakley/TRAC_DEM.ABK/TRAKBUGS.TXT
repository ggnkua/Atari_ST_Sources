            A help file for users of the STOS Tracker extension V1.0

     DON'T PANIC!

          What's this?  Bugs?  Relax,  they're not too bad. Nothing to stop
     you including tracker music in your programs. This text file is simply
     to help you to get the most from the STOS Tracker.  Not all the things
     I'm  about  to mention are "bugs";  just concepts which  are  easy  to
     misunderstand (what Atari call "Features").

     1. MEMORY BANKS

          Make sure that the tracker bank you wish to play is the last bank
     reserved or loaded into memory (ie. it has the highest start address).
     If you TRACK LOAD a file into memory,  and then reserve or load a bank
     after it, you will crash the computer when you TRACK PLAY.

          However,  you  may  safely  load or reserve banks  after  a  STOS
     Tracker bank, provided you erase them before attempting to TRACK PLAY.

     2. THE CONVERTERS

          There  is  a  considerable  difference  between  CONVERT.PRG  and
     CONVERT.BAS.  CONVERT.PRG is NOT a STOS program and most certainly not
     a compiled version of CONVERT.BAS.

          CONVERT.PRG's primary use is to convert Care Bear TCB .MOD  files
     into  Noisetracker  .MOD files.  It will not convert files  into  STOS
     Tracker .ABK format.

          CONVERT.BAS  is used to convert Noisetracker .MOD files (and  NOT
     Care  Bear TCB .MOD files) into STOS Tracker .ABK format.  Do not  re-
     number it as some line number calls are stored as variables. Do not go
     through  it and change it as you may cause the SAMCOPY variable to  be
     misinterpreted as a command.

     3. TRACK PLAY n

          Note  that,  for converted Noisetracker files  anyway,  the  only
     valid value of n is 1.  Converted Noistracker modules may only contain
     one  tune.  I presume other values of n are valid for directly  copied
     AMOS banks,  created using AMOS Tracker,  but since there appear to be
     none in circulation in the ST world, who knows?

     4. TRACK BANK n

          This  command will not compile correctly,  and to the best of  my
     knowledge,  will cause a crash when executed in compiled programs. The
     solution  is  to load banks in one at a time from  disk,  using  TRACK
     LOAD.  This  will automatically set the current bank to the  last  one
     loaded.

          The upshot is that you cannot compile programs with .ABK files as
     data; they must be loaded seperately.

     5. TRACK TEMPO n

          50  is most certainly NOT a suitable alternative.  Try values  in
     the range 10 to 20.

     6. FREQUENCIES

          Due  to  the  lowering  in  playback  frequency  (ie.  speed  and
     therefore quality),  high pitched noises like bells, whistles and some
     speech samples will sound distorted, as if played over the telephone.

     7. NOISETRACKER PROBLEMS

          You  will  almost  certainly  get  problems  trying  to   convert
     Noisetracker .MOD files to .ABK, even using CONVERT.BAS.

          STOS Tracker will ignore the default loop length value;  in other
     words,  most  tunes will play once only,  then fizzle out  and  crash,
     rather  than looping back to the start.  The solution is to add a  new
     pattern,  using  the Empire Noisetracker program,  at the end  of  the
     tune, containing the first voice first line -- 00B00. You will need to
     familiarise  yourself  with  the  Empire  Noisetracker  program   (not
     supplied) before you will be able to do this.  I suggest you read  the
     Noisetracker manual and experiment (how do you think I found out?).

          STOS Tracker will also execute the commands B (jump to  specified
     pattern  position) and D (jump to next pattern) one note  before  they
     are due. The solution is to move all these commands to the note after,
     again  using  the Empire Noisetracker  program.  However,  the  actual
     melodic notes will sound at the correct times- it's just the  commands
     you nee to move. Should these commands appear at line 3F you will need
     to move them to the next pattern;  which will cause real compilcations
     if the next pattern is used in other parts of the tune.

          For all I know, STOS Tracker may execute all effects commands one
     note early, but other than B and D they are not noticeable.

     C'EST TOUT!

          If  you  repeatedly encounter  problems  converting  Noisetracker
     files,  I  suggest  you give up and buy some of  Goodman  Enterprises'
     ready-converted .ABK file disks. Ring Goodmans on UK 0782 335650.

          If  your name is Francios Lionet,  PLEASE CAN WE HAVE AN  UPDATED
     VERSION WITH LESS BUGS? Thanks.

          Si  vous applez-vous Francios Lionet,  EST-QUE CE  POSSIBLE  POUR
     ECRIRE  POUR NOUS UN NOUVELLE VERSION AVEC  MOINS  PROBLEMMES,  S.V.P?
     Merci.
