differences in version 1.2 in parenthesis)

Hi. This is my first attempt at programming my ST, so keep that in
mind while you use this program. 

I would appreciate detailed bug reports and good suggestions for
improvments. If you like the program, please let me know that too.
Nothing feels as good as having people appreciate your work! 
(Well, almost nothing) :D.  

This program started because I download a lot of text files from BBS's
for later reading and the Show function on the desktop didn't meet my
needs. I wanted to be able to search for keywords and page up and not
keep having disk accesses all the time. So I made File Spy which
has all those functions that I mentioned. It loads the entire file in 
memory and lets me manipulate my way though any text file I want.

The easiest way to use File Spy is to put a copy of it on any
disk that you keep Text files on, and then use the install
application function on the desktop to install such extenders
as .TXT or .DOC etc.... Then you may double click on the text
file you wish to read and File Spy will automatically run.
(This still works, but now if you run File Spy directly, you
will be presented with an Item Selector to choose your file)

After File Spy loads your file, the first page will be 
displayed along with a status line that tell you the page your on,
the number of pages in the file, and the logical options you can
use on that page. Logical meaning that you don't want to page up
on the first page and you wouldn't want to go to the bottom of
the file on the last page, etc...

F1 key allows you to type in a string to search for (Case sensitive)
and the program will search from the top of the next page to the
bottom of the file for it. If it finds it, the display will start
from the line that the string was found. If not, a message will tell
you so and ask you to press a key to continue. Press F2 key to search
for the next occurance of that string.

F3 key allows you to mark the current page for printing or for
returning to if you want to move someplace else in the file for
reference or searching. Press F4 to return to that page or F5 to
print that page.

F10 allows you to print the entire file. Press Undo to abort the
printing. (All printing is now done in the background, so now as
soon as you ask to print the file, File Spy will send your stuff
to the printer while you are able to continue reading your file
on screen)

Press the Help key to get a listing of the options.

Press Undo to quit the program.

(Additions to version 1.2,  you can now scroll back and forth one
line at a time, and using the F6 key, you may choose another file
to display using the Item Selector)

You can run this program in all resolutions. If you run it in low, the
program will switch to medium to display the file and then switch back
to low after it's finished.

The rest of the options should be self explanitory, but if you
have any questions, please feel free to let me know. Thank you.

Remember, this program is SHAREWARE! If you like it, please let me
know! $5.00 would be encouraging, but a postcard would be nice too.
