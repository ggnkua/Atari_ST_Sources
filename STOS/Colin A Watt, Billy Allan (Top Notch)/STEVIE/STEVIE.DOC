	After aquiring a 2 Meg STE through extreme good luck, I
decided that the time had come for STOS users to take full advantage
of the STE's enhancements (let's NOT mention the STE or BLITTER
extensions).  After several weeks of extremely hard, fiddly work
and endless nights poring over inaccurate, badly written, apocryphal
documentation I emerged from my study tired, blood stained and
emotionally drained clutching the child of my genius - STEVIE WONDER.


Truth
-----

	After fluking an STE, I knocked up a dodgy STE extension in
5 minutes.



Commands
--------

	There now follows a short summary of the commands showing
the parameters used.  It would be a good idea to print this bit and
keep it at hand as a quick reference.

	Now we have an in-depth (ha!) explenation of the commands, there
uses and how to use them.

*PLEASE NOTE*
-------------

	All addresses are actual.  you would type start(5) instead of 5.
 This can be the cause of serious crashes so take care.

**************************************************************************


REAL SCREEN
-----------

	real screen	ADDR,WIDTH,HEIGHT,X,Y

	Real screen is a command for doing hardware-scrolling.  It is
a bit tricky to get your head around how this works if you are not
used to it but lets try anyway.  You define a screen which is larger
than the physical screen.  You then look into this screen at a
logical X and Y co-ordinate but you only see a portion of 320 X 200
pixels at one time.  Confused? never mind. 


ADDR	 is the address of a memory bank to use for the screen.  The
	size of this bank is calculated using the 'screen size' command.

WIDTH	is the logical width of the screen.  This must be a multiple of
	16 only, if its not then it gets rounded down.

HEIGHT	is the logical height of the screen.

X	is the X co-ordinate into the screen.

Y	is the Y co-ordinate into the screen.

*PLEASE NOTE*

	For complex technical reasons, when you define a 'real screen'
of 320 pixels wide, horizontal scrolling is in multiples of 16 only.
You can solve this problem by making it 336 wide.



Example
-------

10 LE=screen size(640,400)
20 reserve as screen 5,le
30 s5=start(5)
40 repeat : waitvbl : X=x mouse : Y=y mouse : M=mouse key
50 real screen(S5,640,400,X,Y)
60 until M<>0


	This example will define a screen which is twice as wide and
twice as high as the physical screen and let you scroll about it using
the mouse.


**************************************************************************


SCREEN SIZE
-----------

	LE=screen size	(WIDTH,HEIGHT)

	Screen size is a function which returns the correct length
of memory bank to reserve for the real screen command.

WIDTH	is the logical width of the screen.

HEIGHT	is the logical height of the screen


Example
-------

	See the example for 'real screen'.


**************************************************************************


BLITTER COPY
------------

	blitter copy	SCREEN1,X1,Y1,X2,Y2,SCREEN2,X,Y

	Blitter copy is a sort of screen copy routine which uses
the blitter.  Because it has to work with the 'real screen' command,
the size of the source screen is the standard 320 X 200,while the size 
of the destination screen is whatever dimensions that you have set
using the 'real screen' command.  If you are not using real screen
then this behaves just like screen copy.

	It also has the advantage of copying things to pixel positions
very quickly indeed (unlike screen copy).


SCREEN1	is the source screen.

X1 & Y1	are the co-ordinates of the top left-hand corner of the source
	block.

X2 & Y2	are the co-ordinates of the bottom right-hand corner of the
	source block.

SCREEN2	is the destination screen.

X & Y	are the co-ordinates on the destination screen to place the
	block.


Example
-------

10 reserve as screen 5,32000 : load "CINDY1.NEO",5
20 LE=screen size(640,400)
30 reserve as screen 6,le : wait 3
40 S5=start(5) : S6=start(6)
50 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,0,0 
60 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,320,0 
70 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,0,200 
80 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,320,200 
90 repeat : waitvbl : X=x mouse : Y=y mouse : M=mouse key
100 real screen(S6,640,400,X,Y)
110 until M<>0

	This will provide you with a nice hardware-scrolling
demo which has a nice picture of Cindy Crawford moving around
when you move the mouse.  Of course you need the right picture file... 


**************************************************************************


REAL COPY
---------

	real copy	SCREEN1,X1,Y1,X2,Y2,SCREEN2,X,Y

	Real copy is also a replacement screen copy command (sort of).
The difference between it and 'blitter copy' is that BOTH the source
and destination screens are assumed to be whatever sizes which you have
defined with 'real screen'.

SCREEN1	is the source screen.

X1 & Y1	are the co-ordinates of the top left-hand corner of the source
	block.

X2 & Y2	are the co-ordinates of the bottom right-hand corner of the
	source block.

SCREEN2	is the destination screen.

X & Y	are the co-ordinates on the destination screen to place the
	block.


Example
-------

10 reserve as screen 5,32000 : load "CINDY1.NEO",5
20 LE=screen size(640,400)
30 reserve as screen 6,le : wait 3
40 S5=start(5) : S6=start(6)
50 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,0,0 
60 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,320,0 
70 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,0,200 
80 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,320,200 
90 repeat : waitvbl : X=x mouse : Y=y mouse : M=mouse key
100 real screen(S6,640,400,X,Y)
110 real copy s6,0,0,160,100,s6,0,-2
120 blitter copy s5,0,0,64,64,s6,(640-x),(400-y)
130 until M<>0

	This example will be the hardware scrolly thing with 
Cindy's upper torso getting copied onto the screen and the top
portion scrolling along.


**************************************************************************


BLITTER MERGE
-------------

	blitter merge	SCREEN1,X1,Y1,X2,Y2,SCREEN2,X,Y,BUFFER

	Blitter merge is not entirely unlike 'blitter copy', the
only differences being the fact that the source block is merged
with the destination screen and the extra parameter.

SCREEN1	is the source screen.

X1 & Y1	are the co-ordinates of the top left-hand corner of the source
	block.

X2 & Y2	are the co-ordinates of the bottom right-hand corner of the
	source block.

SCREEN2	is the destination screen.

X & Y	are the co-ordinates on the destination screen to place the
	block.

BUFFER	This is an area of memory for internal use by the command.
	If STOS wasn't so inherently rubbish in the way extensions
	work, this parameter would not have been needed - take note
	Francois!  For safetys sake this should be 8400 bytes but if
	you are only copying small blocks, you can get away with less.
	The formula is ((WIDTH/8)+2)*HEIGHT.  If you are in doubt,
	just make it 8400 bytes.


Example
-------

5  reserve as work 4,8400
10 reserve as screen 5,32000 : load "CINDY1.NEO",5
20 LE=screen size(640,400)
30 reserve as screen 6,le : wait 3
40 S4=start(4) : S5=start(5) : S6=start(6)
50 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,0,0 
60 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,320,0 
70 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,0,200 
80 blitter copy s5,0,0,320,200,s6,320,200 
90 repeat : waitvbl : X=x mouse : Y=y mouse : M=mouse key
100 real screen(S6,640,400,X,Y)
110 real copy s6,0,0,160,100,s6,0,-2
120 blitter merge s5,0,0,64,64,s6,(640-x),(400-y),s4
130 until M<>0

	This time Cindy's bossoms are merged onto the screen.

**************************************************************************


BLITTER WIPE
------------

	blitter wipe SCREEN

	This is a version of CLS which uses a certain piece of hardware
which is exclusive to the STE, can you guess which one?  It also works
fine with 'real screen'


SCREEN	is the address of a screen (really?)


Example
-------

10 LE=real length(640,200)
20 reserve as work 5,le : wait 3
25 S5=start(5)
30 blitter wipe S5

	This will reserve a 640 X 400 sized screen and clear it.  

**************************************************************************


DAC PLAY
--------

	dac play	ADDR,LENGTH/SAMPLE NO,FREQUENCY,STATUS

	Dac play is a sample replay which uses the STE's DAC chip.
The command can work in 2 ways.  The first way is using raw sample data
which means that the second parameter is the length of the sample.  The
second way is to use a specially formatted sample bank which means that
the second parameter is the sample number.  The command works out which
is which automatically.  The format of the sample bank is the same as
the 'digi play' command in the Missing Link extension, and a program to
make these up should have been saved out with this DOC file.  It as
called 'MAKE_DAC.BAS' or something.


ADDR			is the address of the sample data.

LENGTH/SAMPLE NO	is the sample length or sample number.

FREQUENCY		0=6.25 khz : 1=12.5 khz 
			2=25 khz : 3=50 khz.

STATUS			0=turn off sample : 1=play sample without loop
			2=play sample with loop.



Example
-------

10 load "DIGI.MBK",5
15 S5=start(5)
20 repeat : z$=inkey$ : until (Z$>="0" and Z$<="9") or Z$=" "
25 if Z$=" " then dac play 0,0,0,0 : default : end
30 T=asc(mid$(Z$,1,1))-48
40 dac play S5,T,0,1
50 goto 20


**************************************************************************


DAC STOP
--------

	dac stop

	This command stops the dac.  No but really!


Example
-------

10 load "DIGI.MBK",5
15 S5=start(5)
20 repeat : z$=inkey$ : until (Z$>="0" and Z$<="9") or Z$=" "
25 if Z$=" " then dac stop : default : end
30 T=asc(mid$(Z$,1,1))-48
40 dac play S5,T,0,1
50 goto 20


**************************************************************************


DAC VOLUME
----------

	dac volume	MODE,VOLUME

	Dac volume sets the volume of the DAC chip.

MODE	can be LEFT, RIGHT or MASTER

VOLUME is the new value which the volume takes.


Example
-------

10 load "DIGI.MBK",5
20 S5=start(5)
30 dac play S5,0,0,2
40 V=100
50 repeat : z$=inkey$ : C=scancode 
60 if c=72 and v>0 then dec V : dac volume master V
70 if c=80 and v<100 then inc V : dac volume master V
80 until Z$=" "
90 dac stop : default : end


**************************************************************************


DAC TREBLE/BASS

	dac treble	VALUE
	dac bass	VALUE

	These 2 commands set the intensity of the DAC's treble (high
frequency sound) and bass (low frequency sound).


VALUE	is the new value to set the treble or bass to.


Example
-------

10 load "DIGI.MBK",5
20 S5=start(5)
30 dac play S5,0,0,2
40 B=100 : T=100
50 repeat : z$=inkey$ : C=scancode 
60 if c=72 and v>0 then dec B : dac bass B
70 if c=80 and v<100 then inc B : dac bass B
80 if c=75 and v>0 then dec T : dac treble T
90 if c=77 and v<100 then inc T : dac treble T
100 until Z$=" "
110 dac stop : default : end


**************************************************************************


DAC MIX
-------

	dac mix		MIX

	Dac mix sets how the DAC chip is mixed with the old YM2149
soundchip.

MIX	is the new value to set the mix by.  This can be 0,1 or 2


0	-12 dB
1	Mix GI sound chip output
2	Do not mix GI sound chip output



**************************************************************************


	Well thats it as far as commands go.  This is by no means a
fully comprehensive STE extension as there are a ton of commands that
could be added.  What it is however, is the bare minimum that you need
in order to do STE demos using STOS.  It is possible to do sprites,
samples, scrolling and any other demo type things.  More commands
will be added if this proves to be lucrative er, I mean popular.
