About
-----
	Stevie Wonder is the latest STOS extension from Top Notch,
the people who brought you Misty and The Missing Link.  It is STE
only.  This program will install the Stevie Wonder extension
into your STOS and COMPILER folders.


HOW TO USE
----------

	When it loads you will be confronted with a screen which has
4 buttons on it:

	INSTALL BASIC

	INSTALL COMP

	INSTALL DOC

	EXIT

	Move the mouse over 'INSTALL BASIC' and press a mouse key, you
will now be asked to insert your STOS disk and press SPACE.  This will
save the BASIC extension into your STOS folder.

	INSTALL COMP is exactly the same except that it saves the
COMPILER extension into your COMPILER folder.

	INSTALL DOC, when clicked on will ask you to insert a disk with
about 50k free on it.  This will save out 3 files:

	STEVIE.DOC	The instruction manual for STEVIE WONDER.

	MAKE_DAC.BAS	A program to make up special sample banks
			for the 'dac play' command (see manual for 
			more details).

	EXAMPLE.BAS	A small example program using STEVIE WONDER.


	Clicking on EXIT will quit to desk top.
