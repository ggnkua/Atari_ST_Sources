Features
________

The ability to define a font of any size from 8X8 pixles
to 32x32 pixels.

The ability to grab characters from a screen.

Icon driven options.


Why?
____

When I got STOS and had look at the font editor I noticed that
4 sizes of font were on offer, but upon closer examination I
also noticed that you were unable to design a font using all
of these sizes unless you had a monochrome moniter.

Undeterred, I thought 'Hey I'll write my own font editor', so I
had a look at the STOS manual and soon found NO documentation
whatsoever on STOS font banks.  After a fruitful evening of
guess work and deduction, I managed to deduce the format of the
font banks and in the process I discoverd a few interesting things.

1..The font can be any width (in multiples of 8)

2..The font can be any Height (within reason)

Pleased with my discoveries, I decided to write a half decent font
editor and you are looking at the results.


How to use this marvelous Font Editor
-------------------------------------

Upon running the editor you will be confronted with a screen which
contains a Box in the top left-hand side of the screen and a bank
of Icons down the right-hand side of the screen.

THE BOX
-------

This box contains an image of the current character that you are editing
which has been magnified 5 times.

This is known as the edit window.

The character is also shown in its actual size.

To edit the character, move the mouse into the box and press the
left mouse button to set a point or press the right mouse button to
clear a point.


THE ICONS
---------

I will go through the icons 1 at a time, explaining their purpose and
uses and any sub-menus which they have.

GET
---
Clicking on this Icon will take you to another screen which will
display all 224 character of the font.

Move the mouse over the desired character and press the left mouse button
and you will now be editing this character.

An important thing to remember is, If the font you are editing will not
fit on the screen in its entirity (Ie its width+height are <=24) you
will see the low-res STOS font.

 
PUT
---
Selecting this option will put you in a similar screen as the GET option
but this time, the character that you select will get replaced by the one 
that you were editing.


SIZE
----
Clicking on this will transport you to a sub menu which will have a
display similar to this:

WIDTH........8
HEIGHT.......8
END

To alter the sizes move the mouse over the one you want to change
(ie if you want to change the width, move the mouse over the word
'WIDTH') and press left mouse button to decrease it or right button
to increse it.

To get back to the main menu move the mouse over END and press any 
mouse button.

The font can be any size from 8X8 to 32X32


INIT
----
This is a very useful function.  Basically it takes the low-res
font and zooms it up to the size of the font that you are editing.

It has a double check in case you click on it accidentaly, this
is because once you have selected this option, it alters the ENTIRE
font.


LOOK  (two little eyes)
----
This is a function which lets you view the whole font, it is only of
real use when you are editing a fairly large font.

When you use this option, wou will be taken to another screen which
displays a line of characters across the top of the screen.

Use left and right mouse buttons to scroll the line of characters
left and right, and press BOTH buttons to return to the main menu.


LOAD  (picture of a disk pointing at a capital L)
----
This option is quite self-explanatory.


SAVE  (capital S pointing at a picture of a disk)
----
So is this one.


Scrolling
---------
The next 4 Icons all feature arrows pointing either left, right, up
or down.

Clicking on one of these will scroll the edit window in the direction
indicated on the arrow.


FLIP
----
The next 2 Icons feature pictures of two-headed arrows.

Clicking on one of these will flip the edit window in the direction
indicated.


CLS
---
This option will clear the edit window.


GRAB
----
Another very useful function.

Selecting this will take you to a sub menu which will contain the
following display.

load screen NEO        : clicking on this will load a NEOCHROME screen
load screen PI1        : clicking on this will load a DEGAS screen
load STOS packed MBK   : clicking on this will load a STOS packed screen
select block
exit and take block
exit

Click on 'select block' and you will be confronted with the screen
that you loaded in.  Where the mouse pointer should be will be a box
which is the same size as your font.  Move over the required bit of 
screen and press a mouse button to select it.

Click on 'exit and take block' to return to the main menu with
the block you have chosen
 
Click on 'exit' to return to the main menu and leave it behind.

When you select a block, although the picture that you have grabbed 
from may have 16 colours, the image that you get will be a 1 colour
block which is obtained by merging together all of the colours in
the original image.


SYSTEM #1, #2 and #3
------
This option will grab the system font specified by the number on it.
#1 will get the low-res font
#2 will get the medium-res font
#3 will get the high-res font


EXIT
----
An obvious one this, it will quit the program and ask you if you wish
to grab the font that you have just created.  It will only allow this
if you have the font editor loaded as an accessory.  


WHO?
----
Who? me of course!  this option displays some information about
the font editor, ie who wrote it.


And thats it!  Confused? just have a go!

0                             $6071963 1 long word  (4 bytes) 
                              identification number.  My guess is
                              that this is Francios Lionets' birthday.

4                             1 word (2 bytes) which contains the font
                              width in multiples of 8.

6                             1 word (2 bytes) which contains the font
                              height.

8-262                         ??? There seems to be a long gap in the
                              font bank here but I don't have a clue why.

264                           The actual font data starts here.  There are
                              224 characters in a stos font bank.  The 
                              length of a bank can be determined by this
                              equation:  (((width/8)*height)*224)+264
