			      Muzak Application. 
			            v1.0.
		     Written by Colin A. Watt of Top Notch.

	This little application was designed for easy playback and
recognition of music files.
	To use it install an application with the doc type "MU?",
assuming you stick to normal music-naming conventions.  Now whenever
you double-click on a music file the application will start up and try
to play the music.
	If you have a decent version of TOS, or NeoDesk/Gemini/KaosDesk
or anything like that then you can drag the ZAK.APP file onto the
desktop and drag the desired music file ontop of it instead.
	The program recognises a wide veriety of formats and will also
depack all of the common packers.

	This application is Public Domain, but any donations are
welcome.
	If you want to get in touch (no time wasters please) then
