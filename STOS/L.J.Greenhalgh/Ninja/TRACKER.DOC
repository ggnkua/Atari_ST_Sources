                    for 1meg STE/TT/Falcon

        This extension is PD so please distribute it far and wide, but
keep all the files together.  The  author  takes no responsibility for
any damage which may occur to  your  computer or files through the use
of this program.

        This extension allows  you  to  play  mods  at  up to 21khz in
STOSin the background on any STE/TT/Falcon.   It shoud be able to play
any four channel protracker mods and  the  vast majority of chip music
formats avaliable.  This  extension  has  been  fully  tested  on  the
Falcon030 and works perfectly. Unlike STOS tracker there is no faffing
about converting mod  files,  just load the  mod you want to play into
a bank and off you go..



        Installation

Copy the file tracker.ext into your stos directory.
Copy the file tracter.ect into you compiler directory.
load STOS.

run the file tracker.bas.

choose the load mod button to select a mod to play.
press space to stop.
click on the numbered buttons to change the frequency.

The mod will happily play in the background at up to 21khz whilst your
STOS program is free to carry on.

Command listing

trackplay ADDRESS
Starts playing the mod  at  address  ADDRESS,  unlike STOS tracker you
don't need to preconvert them or anything  strange like that. If a mod
is already playing then this same  command stops the currently playing
mod.

VALUE=vu meter(INTEGER)
gets then volume of any of the 4 channels , INTEGER is in the range 1-
4.

track frequency INTEGER
initially the extension is set up to play  mods at 16khz , this can be
changed   by   this    command.    Values    of    INTEGER    can   be
5000,8500,12000,14000 or 21000. Obviously the higher the frequency the
better the mods sound but the less time  there is for the rest of your
program.

VALUE=track pos
gets the current mod's position

VALUE=track pattern
gets the current mod's pattern

Integer=track key
gets the value of the acia at  $FFFC02,  ie reads the keyboad  for the
less techy readers.

track info
displays the command list,note this command does not exist
in compiled form, so don't try and compile it.

Things to watch out for:

Make sure that the size of the bank that you allocate for the
mod is at least 20k more than  the  size  of  the largest mod , as the
routine needs workspace.

Dont stop a mod and then restart it, as it screws up, reload
the mod in again instead.

surprise ,surprise the keyboard can't be  read as usual whilst a modis
playing ,get the value  of   the   keyboard   by peeking $FFFC02 or by
using MISTY'S hardkey command instead.

If you are woundering why  the  compiler  part  of the extension is so
much smaller than the interpreted  part,  the  reason  is that the mod
player is compressed for the  compiler  part,  each  time it is run it
decompresses itself. So now you know.
