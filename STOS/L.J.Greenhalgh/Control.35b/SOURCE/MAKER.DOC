                Maker.bas V2.1

        This program makes the font and  image banks for the image and
font commands. All the images are preshifted which means they take up
a large amount of memory , beware ! If you are running it on a 1/2 meg
machine then be sure to delete all unnecessay accessories and programs
first.

        Upon loading you will be presented with the main screen.

        Make sprites into image bank

        This will ask you to choose a sprite mbk to load and will then
convert it into an image bank.

        grab images from picture

        This will ask you to choose  a   picture   file to load , from
which you can select your images.

        Make an alphanumeric fontbank

        This will ask you to  choose  a  picture   file to load , from
which you can select the letters and numbers for your font bank.

        Make a  letters only fontbank

        This will ask you to  choose  a  picture  file  to load , from
which you can select the letters for your font bank.

        The Width and Height of the  images can be altered by clicking
on the arrows opposite them .

        The picture type can  be  altered  by  clicking on the arrows,
presently the formats supported  are  pi1,neo,ca1  (crack art) and mbk
(screen banks, compressed).

        The number of image copies   refers  to how accurately you can
place your object on the screen with  respect to their x coordinates .
An image copy number of 16 means you can place your images every pixel
, an image copy number of 8  means  you  can place your images every 2
pixels ,4 is 4 pixels and so  on  .  The greater the accuracy the more
memory will be required as  more  shifted  versions of the images will
need to be stored


        If you have choosen  anything  other  than  'Make sprites into
image bank 'sprite bank' then  you  will  be presented with the loaded
picture and a small box which   represents   the  place from which the
image will be grabbed.Note that once  you  have grabbed one image then
all the other ones must be the same size.

        Move around the screen and click  on  the images with the left
mouse button.Note that you  can  only  grab  images  which are on word
boundaries . Normally you can  only  move  vertically  in steps of the
images height selected from the  main  screen  , this is called Y-Lock
and can be changed  from  either  the  main  screen  or  by a keyboard
shortcut.
