Move the file extn.prg before basic???.prg in  your auto folder , or 1
directory above your STOS folder if you have a hard drive.

        The extension selector  will  now  load  and  run  before STOS
starts.The currently activated extensions  are  shown  in  white , the
inactivated ones in black  .Click  on  the  'up'  or 'down' buttons to
scroll arround the list of extensions.Click  on done when finished. To
activate/disactivate an extension , click  on  its name and then click
the  activate/disactivate   button.   The   disactivate   all   button
disactivates all the extensions  ,  the  activate all button activates
all the extensions (strange that!).The  restore default button returns
the extensions to their initial status when the program was run.
        The list  commands  button  shows  a  list  of  the  currently
selected extension's commands on the  screen.The print commands button
prints a list of the currently selected extension's commands on to the
printer.
                        Enjoy
