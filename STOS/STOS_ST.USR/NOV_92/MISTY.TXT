                Written by Billy Allan and Colin Watt

                             Version  1.7
                               23/06/92


Some notes about the commands:
        First of all, all the graphics commands assume that you are in
low-res.  If you want to write a game/demo in medium res then I
suggest you write your own bloody extension!  None of the commands
relate to mono because neither of us has a mono monitor, so we
couldn't test any routines we tried.  Still, if enough people
register...
        Secondly, all of the addresses passed must be actual.  That
is, you must pass "start(14)" rather then "14".  If you are going to
be using one bank a lot, it will be quicker to define a variable which
holds the start of the bank rather than work it out every time.
        Lastly, none of the commands will accept real numbers (ie,
those with a # after them).  There are two reasons for this.  First of
all, I never use real numbers in games or demos as they slow things
down, and secondly, we don't have enough documentation on having two
lots of parameters, one of integers, the other of real.  If anyone
can supply said information, we would be very pleased.  Chuffed even.

Command List:

COL (Screen,X,Y)
        Return the colour on Screen at co-ordinates X,Y.
        E.g.
                print col(start(14),100,85)

        This is a new version of the POINT command.  It has three main
        advantages over it though. First of all, it's twice as fast!
        Secondly, you can test the point of a screen at any address,
        as in the example.  Thirdly, it will not crash if you test a
        pixel outside of the screen, so you could test a pixel at
        400,900 and it would NOT crash your program!  The smart ones
        among you may have realised that this means it isn't clipped, so
        do be careful (not so much with this one, but you'd better watch
        what you're doing with DOT).


DOT Scr,X,Y,C
        Plot a pixel on screen at address Scr, co-ordinates X,Y in
        colour C.
        Eg.
                10 for T=1 to 100
                20 dot logic,rnd(319),rnd(199),rnd(15)
                30 next t

        This is a new version of PLOT, but with the same advantages
        as the COL command has over POINT.


FASTCOPY Screen1,Screen2
        Copy Screen1 to Screen2.
        Eg.
                fastcopy start(14),logic

        This is a new version of SCREEN COPY X TO Y.  It is much
        faster than screen copy, it can copy the whole screen in under 1
        vbl!  It also doesn't care about the address of the screen, so
        you can enter "fastcopy back+160,logic" which would crash
        the equivalent screen copy version.


SKOPY N,Scr1,X1,Y1,X2,Y2,Scr2,X3,X4
        Copies the screen-data from Scr1 to Scr2.  X co-ordinates only
        on 16 boundary!  "N" is the number of bitplanes* to copy.
        Eg.
                skopy 4,logic,0,0,32,15,physic,160,100

        This is a new version of screen copy.  It has much the same
        advantages as FASTCOPY over screen copy, plus the ability
        to copy different bitplanes
        Passing the bitplanes as 1 to 4 will use the clipped routine, but
        if you pass them as 11 to 14 then it will be unclipped.
        There is a bug in the command which we haven't fixed yet, sorry.  If
        you try to SKOPY from a negative co-ordinate to the same negative
        co-ordinate in the X-axis the block won't get copied.  So, for example,
        the command "skopy 1,logic,-32,0,64,32,physic,-32,0" wouldn't do
        anything...  This will be corrected in the next update.


FLOPRD Buffer,NumSecs,Side,Track,Sector,Drive
        Read Numsecs starting at Sector and store at Buffer
        Eg.
                10 reserve as work 10,512
                20 floprd start(10),1,0,0,1,0

        You can achieve the same thing with a TRAP call, but this is
        slightly faster and easier to remember.
        Do not pass DRIVE as the drive parameter!  I tried it last night
        and STOS didn't like it very much.


FLOPWRT Buffer,NumSecs,Side,Track,Sector,Drive
        Write sectors to disk.


MEDIACH (D)
        Checks whether the disk in drive D has been changed.
        Returns:
                0 - Definitely changed
                1 - Maybe changed
                2 - Not changed
        Eg.
                print mediach (0)

        This command can be achieved with a call to TRAP also.  At the
        moment this command doesn't work correctly (I think), but I
        don't know why!  It could be that the documentation I have on the
        BIOS are incorrect.


HARDKEY
        Returns the contents of the hardware keyboard register.
        Eg.
                10 print "Press SPACE"
                20 repeat : until hardkey=57

        This was added as some music and assembly routines cuts off
        the INKEY$ command, and it looks a lot nicer than the PEEK.
        Do remember to put in a "CLEAR KEY" at the end of your routine
        though!


NDRV
        Returns the number of drives attached to the computer.
        Eg.
                print ndrv

        This can be achieved with a deek to a system variable, but
        it was something I thought merited a command seeing as I
        can never remember the correct address.


MOUSEOFF
        COMPLETELY disable mouse reporting.
        Eg.
                10 showon
                20 print "Move the mouse, then press space"
                30 repeat : until inkey$=" "
                40 mouseoff
                50 print "Move the mouse again, then press space"
                60 repeat : until inkey$=" "
                70 mouseon

        This is a very useful command for demo-coders.  The hide(on)
        command merely hides the pointer, but if you waggle the
        mouse around, it will still use upto 30% processor time to
        move a non-existent pointer!  So if your screen/game is just
        at the bottom of a vbl, you don't need to worry about some
        prat waggling the mouse around and saying "Oh look, it makes
        it go all flickery!"


MOUSEON
        Enables mouse reporting after a call to MOUSEOFF.
        Eg.
                See MOUSEOFF


FREQ
        Return the frequency of the monitor (50 or 60). Mono is always
        70hz, so there's no point in returning it.
        Eg.
                print freq

        This command will become more useful when (stroke if) the SETFREQ
        command is added...


RESVALID
        Returns TRUE is the reset vector is set and FALSE otherwise.
        Eg.
                10 if resvalid then print "Lard!"

        This can be very useful for either check for a virus or
        to see if someone has one of those picture-ripper type
        programs in that uses the reset vector to install itself.
        Don't you just love "Swan Rot"?


SETRTIM x
        Sets the value of the REAL timer.
        Eg.
                setrtim 0


RTIM
        Returns the value of the REAL timer.
        Eg.
                print rtim


        These 2 timing commands were added after we had severe
        problems with some music types and some border-removal routines
        where the TIMER variable was needed.  For instance, after playing
        some Synth-dream music TIMER would no longer update, which caused
        quite a lot of problems in games where you were to be invulnerable
        for the first 3 seconds or whatever.


WARMBOOT
        Causes a reset, as if you had pressed the reset button.
        Eg.
                10 repeat : g$=upper$(inkey$) : until g$<>""
                20 if g$="Q" then warmboot

        This command can be very useful for making sure people aren't
        mucking around with your programs.  A reset is always dishearting
        to inept crackers...


AESIN
        Checks whether GEM is initialised or not.
        Eg.
                10 if aesin then ?"Do you like GEM or something?"

        This command is used to make sure a program that's supposed to run
        from the AUTO folder isn't being run from the desktop, which can be
        extremely useful for demo's.


BLITTER
        Checks for a blitter chip.
        Eg.
                10 if blitter then ?"Huh!"

        I think it's only fair to tell you that this command is
        untested due to the fact that neither of us have blitters!


SILENCE
        Stops all sounds.
        Eg.
                10 dreg(0)=1 : call start(10)
                20 repeat : call start(10)+2 : until inkey$=" "
                30 silence

        Very very useful for clearing those residual notes left when you
        stop a bit of music.


KBSHIFT
        Returns the values of the shift+special keys.
        Eg.
                10 print "Press BOTH shift keys"
                20 repeat
                30 until kbshift=3

        This command can be useful in games as you can test for
        combinations of different keys (as in the example).


KOPY Src, Dst, Size
        This is a super-fast version of the COPY command.  It will
        copy Size number of bytes (EVEN!) from address Src to
        address Dst.
        Eg.
                10 cls back,1
                20 kopy back,logic,32000

        This command is about twice as fast as COPY.  It is very, very
        useful for disting objects for demo coders.  Make sure that the
        number of bytes you copy is even though!  You may not like the
        consequences if you don't...
        We would like to thank, from the very bottom of our
        hearts Neilly of The Gap.  You ought to keep a look out for his
        game which shall be finished soon, and it really is of a
        rather high quality.  It will almost certainly be called 'Live
        Wire' and is a 50Hz shoot-em-up extravaganza!

        Here are the timings for each command (at least the four which
merit timing, I mean, there's not much point timing NDRV is there?).

        As you can see, our commands are quite a bit faster!  And
considering the advantages, I would think that it would be well worth
your time registering!


Bitplanes:
        First of all,for those of you who don't know how the ST screen
display is set up I will include a short piece about it.
        The ST screen display is made up of four 'BITPLANES' this is
rather like having four translucent pieces of plastic in front of each
other.  The sixteen colours are made by varying combinations of pixels
set in each bit-plane for example:-

        colour 1 is made by a pixel set in the 1st bitplane
        colour 2 by one in the 2nd
        colour 3 is made by a combination of 1 & 2
        colour 4 is one in the 3rd
        colour 5 is one in the 3rd & 1st
        colour 6 is one in the 3rd & 2nd
        colour 7 is one in the 3rd , 2nd & 1st
        colour 8 is one in the 4th

        Colours 9 - 15 are the same as 1 - 8 but with plane 4 set.
Obviously colour 0 is the background and has nothing set

For more information on bitplanes read :-
Herman Willey  : The ST screen display - a new perspective
Jonathan Small : Bitplanes - a metaphysical breakdown
Alice Hats     : A periodic history of multi-planar screen displays

SKOPYing - a foreword:
        To fully understand the use of SKOPY first you have to know
one important thing about the SCREEN COPY command.  It copies 4 planes
and nothing else.  This is fine in itself but 4 plane screen copy
takes a lot of time - hence the need for something faster, ie a 1, 2
or 3 plane screen copy.
        This is exactly what SKOPY does.

Good points:
        As well as being fast it means that you can do separate
graphics functions on separate bitplanes.  For example, you can draw
all of your sprites on plane 4 and your background on plane 1.  This way
they won't erase each other or flicker and you don't have to use a
buffer to hold sprite backgrounds.  This technique is used extensively
in "The Cunning Demos" and the soon to be released "Misty demo" (with a
different name probably).

Problems (yuk):
        The main problem is the fact that you have to engineer your
palette so that you don't end up with a complete mess.
        For example, imagine you have a picture which is drawn using
colour 1.  Now, if you copy a 1 plane image onto plane two all of the
areas where the two images meet will be colour three!  The only way
around this would be to make colour three either the same as colour 1
or the same as colour 2.  This has the disadvantage of limiting your
palette.
        It does however, mean that one can make "transparent"
sprites/scrollers.  By setting the palette so that when your sprite
moves over the background the colours displayed where they cross are
brighter versions of those in the background, which can produce some
very nice effects.

Storage:
        The ST's (low-res) screen is made up of four bitplanes.  These
are stored as series of 2-byte (1 word) chunks.  Each word controls
the 16 pixels on it's plane (eg %0000000000000000 means that the 16
pixels are empty, %1000000100010000 means that there is 1 pixel at the
far left hand side and two in the middle).
        So, to address any one plane of the screen, use an offset of 2
bytes from the screens address.

        EG.

        skopy 1,logic,0,0,160,100,logic+2,0,0
        would copy a 160x100 chunk of bitplane 1 to bitplane 2.

        skopy 1,logic,0,0,16,20,logic+4,144,100
        would copy a 16x20 chunk of bitplane 1 to bitplane 3.

        skopy 1,logic,0,0,160,100,logic+6,0,0
        would copy a 160x100 chunk of bitplane 1 to bitplane 4

        skopy 2,logic,0,0,320,200,logic+4,0,0
        would copy the whole of bitplanes 1+2 to planes 3+4.

Confused:
        Well, try it out and see!
