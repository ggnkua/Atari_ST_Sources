EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE OVERSCAN PICTURE DISPLAY ROUTINE


First of all load an overscan picture into a bank....

reserve as work 5,64000:bload "TEST>BIG",5



Then load in overscan routine....

load "OVERSTOS.PRG",15



10 click off : curs off : hide : key off : mode 0
20 physic=default back                              ; see below  *
30 copy start(5)+112,start(5)+63054 to physic       ; copy in picture data
40 copy start(5)+2,start(5)+34 to $FF8240           ; copy in palette data
50 call start(15)+28                                ; call overscan routine
60 default


* the reason that we make physic=default back is that the default 
background screen is 32K less than default physic, so this in effect
gives us a 64K data bank.
